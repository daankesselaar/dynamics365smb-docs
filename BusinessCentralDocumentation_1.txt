# Configure API Templates

The API library for [!INCLUDE[prod_short_md](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a simplified representation of the underlying entities. All the properties in the application are not exposed through the associated API. The **API Setup** page allows you to define templates that are used to populate empty properties on an entity when you create a POST action through the API. 

For example, if a configuration template is defined for the item entity, when a new item record is created through the items API, any properties for the new item that are not defined in the API call will be populated from the selected template. If, for example, no value is defined for the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** field through the API, but a value is defined in the selected template, then the posting group value defined in the template will be applied to the new item. 

## Setting up the Entity Template

To use templates with the API library, you must first set up and define properties for the templates. You can set up these templates on the **Configuration Templates** page. For more information, see [Migrate On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data) (in English only) in the administration content.  

## Assign the template to an API

To assign a template to an API, you must go through the following steps.

> [!NOTE]  
> API templates can only be set up with the following API pages: contacts, countriesRegions, currencies, customers, employees, itemCategories, paymentMethods, paymentTerms, shipmentMethods, unitsOfMeasure, and vendors.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **API Setup**, and choose the related link.
2. Choose **New**, and then choose the **Order** value for the record.  

    If there is more than one template selected for an API (Page ID), the templates are applied in the order defined in the **Order** column.  

    When each template is applied, field values defined in the template are only applied to fields that have not already had a value defined, either explicitly in the API, or in a previously applied template in the order.  
3. Select a **Page ID** value.  

    This is the page for the API to which the template will be applied. The **Page ID** lookup provides a list of all APIs available in the library.
4. Select a value in the **Template Code** field.  

    The template code is the code for the template that was defined on the **Configuration Templates** page. The template values defined are applied to the API.  
5. In the **Conditions** field, specify which template should be applied.  

    The defined template is applied to a new record created through the API if, and only if, the conditions defined in the **Conditions** field are met by the values already defined for the new instance of the entity.

# Purchases by Vendor (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Purchases by Vendor** report provides an overview of purchasing activities by vendor. This report you find out which vendors supply the most frequently purchased item categories and items. It also shows how much you spend on these purchases.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-by-vendor.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases by Vendor Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-by-vendor.png":::

## Use the report

The report is especially useful for purchasing managers and purchasers.

Purchasing managers can use the report to analyze vendor performance. You can identify the vendors who supply the most frequently purchased item categories and items. This information can help you optimize purchasing strategies, negotiate better prices, and improve overall vendor management.

Purchasers can use this report to monitor purchasing activities and identify the suppliers of specific products. For example, if you need a list of suppliers for the components of dining chair assemblies, you can view the purchase quantities and amounts spent on each vendor. The report can help you select the best vendor to buy from.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Purchases by Vendor* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)
- [**Purchase Quantity**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-quantity)
- [**% GT Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#-gt-purchase-amount)
- [**% GT Purchase Amount PY (Fiscal)**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#-gt-purchase-amount-py-fiscal)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Vendor
- Item
- Value Entry
- Purchase Line

# Business Central and OneDrive integration

OneDrive for work or school (formerly known as OneDrive for Business) is a cloud storage service that is included in Microsoft 365. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes it easy to store, manage, and share files with other people through OneDrive. When a file is in your OneDrive you enjoy the rich collaborative experiences from the online versions of Microsoft products, such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. For example, you can share a Word document, and then you and your colleagues can edit it together in real-time. OneDrive also lets you open other types of files, such as PDFs. 

## Get started with OneDrive features

If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, we've already created the connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and OneDrive, so it's easy to get started. The only requirement is that users have opened OneDrive at least one time. With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, an administrator has to configure the connection before you can get started. Learn more at [Managing OneDrive Integration with Business Central](admin-onedrive-integration.md).

<!-- We've created the connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and OneDrive, so it's easy to get started. The only requirement is that users have opened OneDrive at least one time. -->

### Open and share in OneDrive

On most pages where files are available, such as the Report Inbox or files that are attached to records, you'll find an **Open in OneDrive** and **Share** actions.

:::image type="content" source="media/onedrive-overview-report-inbox-w-outline.png" alt-text="The Open in OneDrive and Share actions for reports":::


:::image type="content" source="media/one-drive-attachments-w-outline.png" alt-text="The Open in OneDrive and Share actions for attachments":::

|Select...|To...|See more info...|
|---------|-----|----------------|
|Open in OneDrive|Copy the file to a Business Central folder in your OneDrive and open the file.|[Open in OneDrive](across-share-onedrive.md#open-in-onedrive) |
|Share|Copy the file to your OneDrive and share it with other people.|[Share in OneDrive](across-share-onedrive.md#share) |

### Save Excel workbooks and report files in OneDrive

With OneDrive integration set up, a couple other familiar features will automatically use OneDrive for saving files instead of saving files on your device:

- The **Open in Excel** and **Edit in Excel** actions on list pages will automatically copy the Excel file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online. For more information, see [Viewing and Editing in Excel](across-work-with-excel.md).
- Sending a report to an Excel or Word file will automatically copy the file to OneDrive, then open it in the Excel or Word online. For more information, see [Saving a report to a file](ui-work-report.md#save-a-report-to-a-file).

These features aren't turned on by default. But as an administrator, you can easily turn them on by using the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide.

<!--
When you use the **Open in OneDrive** action for the first time, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does the following in your OneDrive:

1. Creates a folder named [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 
2. In the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] folder, it creates another folder with the same name as the company you're working in. If you work in more than one company, it will create a folder for the company you're working in when you use the **Open in OneDrive** action. 
3. Puts a copy of the file you selected in the folder, and then opens the file. The next time you use the action, it only copies and opens the file. 

The folder and its content are private until you decide to share them with others. For example, you might decide to share content with one or more of your coworkers, or even people outside of your organization. For more information, see [Share OneDrive files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/office/share-onedrive-files-and-folders-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07) in the content for OneDrive.
-->

> [!NOTE]
> You can also connect your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to OneDrive. However, there are a few things to do to make it work. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central On-Premises](admin-onedrive-integration-onpremises.md).

# Correct prepayments

You can make a correction to an order after you have posted a prepayment invoice for the order. You can add new lines to an order after issuing a prepayment, and then you can post another prepayment invoice, but you can't delete a line from an order after a prepayment has been invoiced for the line.  

> [!TIP]
> If you have posted a prepayment invoice for a sales invoice that you then correct or cancel, you must correct or cancel the prepayment as well.

## To correct a prepayment

The following procedure shows how to issue a prepayment credit memo to cancel all invoiced prepayments for a sales order.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant sales order.
3. Choose the **Prepayment** action, and then choose the **Post Prepayment Credit Memo** action or the **Post and Print Prepmt. Cr. Memo** action.  
4. On the **Sales Credit Memo** page, proceed to correct the relevant entries, as for any sales credit memo. For more information, see [Process Sales Returns or Cancellations](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md).  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To reduce the amount in the **Line Amount** field, you must first increase the prepayment percentage on the line so that the value in the **Prepmt. Line Amount** field is not decreased below the value in the **Prepmt. Amt. Inv.** field.

5. To make a prepayment invoice for any new lines in the sales credit memo, choose the **Prepayment** action, and then choose the **Post Prepayment Invoice** action or the **Post and Print Prepmt. Invoice** action.  
6. To issue an additional prepayment invoice, increase the prepayment amount on one or more lines and post the prepayment invoice. A new invoice will be created for the difference between the prepayment amounts invoiced and the new prepayment amounts.

# Setting up finance

Before you can begin to run your business, you must specify how you want to manage company finance processes. First, you set up the core of the company's accounting records: the chart of accounts (COA). Then you set up posting groups, which make the process of assigning default general ledger posting accounts to customers, vendors, and items more efficient.

Some finance setup can be done automatically with assisted setup guides, and some must be done manually. Learn more at [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md). The **General Ledger Setup** page specifies how to handle of your company's different accounting processes. For example, use this page to specify invoice rounding details, the currency code for your local currency, address formats, and whether you want to use an additional reporting currency. Learn more at [Understanding the General Ledger and the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md).  

You can use dimensions to add different types of information to every transaction. You can set up your company's basic dimensions, such as *Projects* and *Departments*. Later, add more dimensions when you need them. For example, you can set up temporary dimensions to use for a limited time period, such during a sales campaign. Learn more at [Working with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

Many of the setup tasks must be completed before you can begin recording financial transactions, but most settings can be adjusted as needed. That said, there are optional setup tasks as well. For example, you need only set-up intercompany postings and consolidations if you're working with multiple companies. And other setup tasks, such as specifying the period during which posting is allowed, might have to be repeated periodically.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Manage master data synchronization

After you set up master data synchronization, when you synchronize for the first time [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does the following:

- Couples records in the selected tables.
- Creates a recurring job queue entry for each table.

The job queue entries automatically synchronize data in the subsidiary companies when someone makes a change in the source company. Otherwise, you don't need to do anything.

> [!NOTE]
> For the automatic synchronization to work, the user who makes the change in the source company must have:
>
> - A [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license.
> - Permission sets that allow them to reschedule a background task in the subsidiary company. To learn more about the required license and permissions, go to [Before you start](admin-set-up-data-sync.md#before-you-start).
>
> Otherwise, the change happens in the next unconditional synchronization run. The unconditional synchronization is controlled by the **Inactivity Timeout Period** field on the job queue entry.

However, sometimes things go wrong, and there might be situations that you need to manage or investigate. For example, if people change the same record in both the source company and a subsidiary, synchronization fails so that you can specify the change that's correct. Or, the source company might install an extension that changes the schema of one of the tables you're synchronizing by adding a field or two. If you want to synchronize the new fields in the subsidiaries, install the same extensions and update the table schemas in their setup.

This article describes the tools you can use to keep synchronization running smoothly.

## Overwrite local changes

You can use the **Overwrite Local Change** checkbox on the fields and tables you synchronize to allow data from the source company to overwrite data in the subsidiary company.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't enable the synchronization of a field and allow the subsidiary to write values in it independently from the source company. You must either disable synchronization for the field, or allow the source company to overwrite local changes.

## Update table schemas

If the source company changes a table, for example, by adding a field that you want to synchronize, subsidiaries must update their field mappings. On the **Synchronization Fields** page, use the **Update Fields** action.

## Enable or disable couplings between records

To start or stop coupling on specific records on a table, on the **Synchronization Fields** page, choose the fields, and then use either the **Enable** or **Disable** actions.

> [!TIP]
> A fast way to enable or disable multiple fields at the same time is to select them in the list, and then use either the **Enable** or **Disable** actions.

## Run a full synchronization

The **Run Full Synchronization** action schedules a synchronization for all of the table records in the source company, and resynchronizes all records unconditionally. For example, resynchronization is useful if you enable an extra field on a synchronization table, or add an extra field by using the **Update Fields** action. The action retroactively synchronizes the data in those fields.

## Synchronize modified records

If you change a setting for a table or field in a subsidiary, you must update the synchronization. To update the synchronization, use the **Synchronize Modified Records** action on the **Synchronization Tables** page.

The **Synchronize Modified Records** action schedules a synchronization of the following table records:

* Records that failed to synchronize in the last attempt.
* Records that were changed in the source company after the last scheduled synchronization. You can review the last scheduled synchronization time on the **Synchronization Tables** page in the **Synchronize Changes Since** field.

The action works in the same way as a scheduled synchronization, and you can use it as a way to synchronize outside the schedule. For example, if you select the **Overwrite Local Change** checkbox on a field to allow data from the source company to overwrite local changes, the action updates that data. You can also just wait until the next scheduled synchronization happens.

## Investigate the status of synchronization

There are two actions on the **Synchronization Tables** page that can help you monitor your synchronization:

* **Integration Synchronization Jobs**
* **Job Queue Entries**

The following table describes the actions.

|Page  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Integration Synchronization Jobs**     | Open the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page to investigate what happened each time a job queue entry ran. To dig deeper into the details about new records that were added, or explore why a record failed to synchronize, choose the numbers in the **Inserted** or **Failed** columns. You can also use this page to clean up older records that you might not need. To learn more about cleaning up, go to [Clean up old entries](#clean-up-old-entries).        |
|**Job Queue Entries**     | Access details about the job queue entry that synchronize data for a selected table. For example, use this page to manage the status of the job queue entry,    To learn more about job queue entries, go to [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).     |

> [!NOTE]
> If you find an error on the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page that you can't resolve yourself, if you contact your partner or Microsoft for support, it's helpful to provide the error message and callstack information.

## Clean up old entries

Over time, the number of entries in the synchronization log will become large, so you might want to do a little housekeeping to remove unneeded entries. To make it easier to clean up old entries, the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page offers the following actions:

* **Delete Entries Older Than 7 Days**
* **Delete All Entries**

## Adding extensions

If the source company installs a new extension, the subsidiary must also install it if they want to synchronize data for it. The subsidiary can use the **Update Fields** action On the **Synchronization Fields** page to add the tables from the extension to the list.

> [!NOTE]
> Some tables get data from related tables. If you add an extension that doesn't include related tables, the fields on those tables aren't available. Verify that you added all related tables.

<!--
## Recreate a deleted job queue entry

If the recurring job queue entry is deleted for a table, you can quickly recreate it. On the **Synchronization Tables** page, choose the **Use Default Synchronization Setup** action.
-->

# Working with RDLC Layouts

RDLC layouts are based on report definition layout files (.rdl or .rdlc file types). The design concepts for RDLC layouts are similar to other layout types. The layout determines what fields to show and how they're arranged. However, designing RDLC layouts is more advanced than Word and Excel layouts.

[![Shows the different elements of an RDLC layout.](media/rdlc-layout.png)](media/rdlc-layout.png#lightbox)

## Required tools

To modify RDL layouts, you can use either Microsoft SQL Server Report Builder or Microsoft Visual Studio with the RDLC Report Designer extension.

- Report Builder is a stand-alone app installed on your computer by you or an administrator. With Business Central on-premises, Report Builder is automatically installed with the Business Central Server installation. For more information about installing Report Builder, see [Install Report Builder](/sql/reporting-services/install-windows/install-report-builder) in the SQL Server documentation.

- RDLC Report Designer is an extension for Visual Studio 2019 and later. You can download and install RDLC Report Designer from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ProBITools.MicrosoftRdlcReportDesignerforVisualStudio-18001).

## Create and modify RDLC layouts

Creating and modifying RDLC layouts is an advanced task, which is typically done by power users or developers. The basic concepts aren't specific to Business Central report layouts. For this reason, we refer you to the following documentation:

- [Create RDL Layout Report](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-howto-rdl-report-layout)

   This article explains how to create an RDLC report layout from AL code.

- [Reports, Report Parts, and Report Definitions](/sql/reporting-services/report-design/reports-report-parts-and-report-definitions-report-builder-and-ssrs?)

   This links you to the SQL Server Reporting Services documentation for RDL/RDLC. This article explains the concepts behind RDL/RDLC and how to use Report Builder.

> [!NOTE]
> Report Builder only recognizes the .rdl file type, not .rdlc. Layout files exported from Business Central are .rdlc file types. So to modify these layout in Report Builder, rename the file type to .rdl.

# Work with Intrastat reporting

All companies in the European Union (EU) must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. You must report the movement of goods to the statistics authorities in your country/region every month, and the report must be delivered to the tax authorities. Intrastat is the system for collecting trade statistics of goods within these countries/regions. You use **Intrastat Report** to complete periodic Intrastat reporting (typically monthly), collecting, recording, and reporting trade of goods as per local government legislation.

Intrastat reporting is based on basic EU regulations that apply to all countries/regions; however, in practice, there are some differences within the individual countries/regions. Each country/region has its rules of what exactly and how to report.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This article describes the new Intrastat experience available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] starting in the 2022 release wave 2, which includes extended features, but if you didn't upgrade your solution, read the previous version's Intrastat setup and usage article at [Set Up and Report Intrastat](finance-how-setup-report-intrastat-v20.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> Intrastat information doesn't apply to the movement of services between countries/regions, but only goods (Items and Fixed Assets). If the local government requires registering  the movement of services between countries/regions, it can be done using the **Service Declaration** feature.
>
> This features is available as an app at [AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). At that time, to use it, you must first install it on the **Extension Management** page. Learn more about this functionality [here](finance-how-setup-use-service-declaration.md).  

## Fill in the Intrastat report

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report List**, and choose the related link.
2. Choose **New** action to create a new **Intrastat Report**.
3. If you need to enter some internal information about the **Intrastat Report**, fill in this information in the **Description** field.
4. In the **Statistic Period** field, specify the month to report data for. Enter the period as a four-digit number with no spaces or symbols. Depending on your country/region, enter either the month first and then the year, or vice versa. For example, enter either *2206* or *0622* for June 2022.
5. Choose the **Suggest Lines** action. The **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields will already contain the dates specified for the statistics period on the Intrastat report header.
6. In the **Cost Regulation %** field, you can enter a percentage to cover transport and insurance. If you enter a percentage, the content of the **Statistical Value** field in the journal is proportionally higher. But if you want to use this feature, you must switch the **Amount incl. Item Charges** field to **Yes**.
7. You can eventually set up extra configurations on the **Additional** FastTab:
   1. **Skip Recalculation for Zero Amounts** to specify that lines without amounts won't be recalculated during the batch job.
   2. **Skip Zero Amounts** to specify that item ledger entries without amounts won't be included in the batch job.
   3. **Skip Non-Invoiced Entries** to specify if item ledger entries that are shipped or received but not yet invoiced must be excluded from the process.
8. Choose **OK** to start the batch job.

The batch job retrieves all the item entries in the statistics period and inserts them as lines in the **Intrastat Report** lines. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Modify the Intrastat report

If needed, you can modify the lines, but whenever you change a value in the Intrastat report line, the **Correction** field will be automatically marked as **Yes**. Eventually, you can add a new line manually if there's a reason for that. To add a new line manually:

1. On the **Intrastat Report** page, choose the **New Line** action in the **Lines** FastTab.
2. Choose the **Receipt** or **Shipment** option in the **Type** field.
3. In the **Source Type** field, choose one of the sources: **Item Entry**, **FA Entry**, or **Job Entry**.
4. Based on the **Source Type** in the **Item No.** field, you can choose an **Item** (in both cases, **Item Entry** or **Job Entry**) or **Fixed Assets**.
5. Fill in other fields as you need for the Intrastat reporting.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you manually add a new line to the Intrastat report, the **Date** field in the line must be inside the **Statistic Period** range you added on the header.

## Validate Intrastat lines

After you fill in the **Intrastat Report**, you can run the **Checklist Report** action to ensure that all information in the **Intrastat Report** is correct. Mandatory fields you have set on Intrastat Report Checklist page that is missing values will be shown in **Errors and warning** FactBox on the **Intrastat Report** page.

Run the **Intrastat Report Checklist** report to check Intrastat lines before they're exported to the required format. The check is run inside the **Intrastat Report**.

## Recalculate weight or supplementary unit of measure

If you got the error message *'Total Weight' in Intrastat Report Line must not be blank*, it's probably because you didn't set the **Net Weight** field on the used source, item, or fixed asset. In this case, search for the item or fixed asset card and add the required value. After that, you just need to reopen the **Intrastat Report** and follow these steps:

1. Choose the **Recalc. Weight/Suppl. UOM** action to recalculate the **Total Weight** and/or **Supplementary Quantity**.
2. Choose one of the options:

    1. **Weight** – to recalculate only the **Total Weight**, based on the current information about **Net Weight** on the item and fixed asset cards.
    2. **Supplemental UOM Qty** – to recalculate only the **Supplementary Quantity** on the **Intrastat Report** line if it exists, based on the current information about **Supplementary UOM** on the item and fixed asset cards.
    3. **Both** – to recalculate both **Total Weight** and **Supplementary Quantity**, based on the current information on the item and fixed asset cards.
3. Choose **OK** to start the batch job.

## Report Intrastat in a file

You can submit the Intrastat report as a file based on different local authorities' requirements. Before creating the file, you should run the **Checklist Report** to check if all lines contain all necessary and valid information. To create a file:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat List**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Intrastat Report** you want to report as a file.
3. If you haven't already done this, fill in the **Intrastat Report** manually or choose the **Suggest Lines** action.
4. Choose the **Create File** action.
5. The Intrastat file will be saved in the required format.

Once you create the file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically fill in the following details about reporting:

* The **Export Date** to specify the date when the report has been exported.
* The **Export Time** to specify the time when the report has been exported.

> [!NOTE]  
> Next time you create a file, the **Export Date** and **Export Time** fields will only keep information about the last file you created.

## Intrastat rules

### Grouping lines

In **Intrastat Report** lines, there's no grouping by any fields. All entries are copied from the original source, so you can quickly locate them based on the combination of **Source Type** and **Source Entry No**.

Grouping required by authorities will be provided in the exported file. You need to configure this in the **Data Exchange Definition**, which is fully configurable. Learn more at [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

### Fixed assets reporting

Fixed assets will be shown in the Intrastat lines only if:

* The **FA Posting Type** in the **FA Ledger Entry** field is **Acquisition Cost** and if the **Document Type** is **Invoice** in the case of purchases, and
* The **FA Posting Type** in the **FA Ledger Entry** field is **Proceeds on Disposal** and if the **Document Type** is **Invoice** in the case of sales.

### Intrastat report statuses

When you work with the **Intrastat Report** you'll see a **Status** field on the document header. You can find the following statuses together with related rules:

* **Open**: This status is created automatically when you create a new Intrastat report and you can make all operations in this status.
* **Released**: [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically changes the status to *Released* when you create a file. From that moment, you can't modify your **Intrastat Report**. If you need to change something and report again, you can use the **Reopen** action to reopen the Intrastat report. Once the document is reopened, you can use the **Release** action to release the document again.
* **Reported**: Specifies whether the entry has already been reported to the tax authorities. This isn't a regular status but an independent field, and even if you reopened the Intrastat report, it would still show that the file is already created for this report.

### Locations in Intrastat reporting 

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always uses the information in the **Country/Region Code** field on the **Location Card** page as the country for **send from** or for **receive to** goods. When this information doesn't exist or location wasn't used, the system uses the information from the **Company Information** page.   

> [!NOTE]  
> If the company operates from more than one country, Intrastat reporting desn't work for all countries where locations are configured. Reporting is based only for the main country, as it's not currently possible to use multi-country reporting.  

### Triangular trade in Intrastat

Triangular trade involves trade between three countries or regions where goods bypass the reporting company's country. In Business Central, this can be facilitated through the [Drop Shipment](sales-how-drop-shipment.md) functionality. To enable this option, activate the **Include Drop Shipment** field in the **Intrastat Report Setup**.  

When you enable this option, the system uses the following rules, but only if you have the **Drop Shipment** marked in the **Sales Order**: 

| Receiving from | Delivering to | Expected Intrastat Result |
|----------|------------|----------------------|
| Country as in the **Company Information** | Country as in the **Company Information** | No Intrastat lines |  
| Country as in the **Company Information** | EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | Intrastat shipping line | 
| Country as in the **Company Information** | Non-EU country | No Intrastat lines |   
| EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | Country as in the **Company Information** | Intrastat receiving line | 
| EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | No Intrastat lines |
| EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | Non-EU country | No Intrastat lines | 
| Non-EU country | Country as in the **Company Information** | No Intrastat lines |  
| Non-EU country | EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | No Intrastat lines |
| Non-EU country | Non-EU country | No Intrastat lines |

# Set up the E-Documents connector with external endpoints

This article explains how to set up E-Documents functionality when connected to external endpoints.

Before you use the functionality that this article describes, you must install the **E-Document Core** app and one of the E-Documents connectors with external endpoints apps. You can use these apps for default integration with the external, non-Microsoft, access points to automate the e-document flow. Because these apps represent only some of the selected connectors, you aren't limited to existing integrations.

## Install an E-Documents connector  

To install an E-Documents connector, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link.
2. Choose the **Install E-Documents integration from AppSource** action to open the **Microsoft AppSource apps** page.
3. Choose the connector you want, and then select the **View on AppSource** action.
4. Install the app from the AppSource.

## Set up the connection

[!INCLUDE[e-documents connectors](includes/edocuments-connectors-include.md)]

Based on the endpoint service provider, the next steps might be different. You can find details about set up parameters for all available service providers [here](finance-edocuments-connectors.md).

## Set up company information

Before you start using e-documents, update your **Company Information** page by completing the following steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then select the related link.
2. In addition to filling in the usual fields, you must also fill in the following fields:

    | Field name | Description |
    |---|---|
    | SWIFT Code | Specifies the SWIFT code (international bank identifier code) of your primary bank. |
    | Bank Branch No. | Specifies the bank's four-digit branch number. |
    | VAT Registration No. | Specifies the company's value-added tax (VAT) registration number. |
    | GLN | Specifies your company in connection with electronic document exchange. |
    | Use GLN in Electronic Document | Specifies whether the GLN is used in electronic documents as a party identification number. |

4. Close the page.

## Set up customers to receive e-documents

To enable customers to receive your e-documents, complete the following steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the **Customer** card.
3. In addition to filling in the usual fields, in the **GLN** field, specify the customer you send electronic documents to.
4. Turn on the **Use GLN in Electronic Documents** toggle to indicate whether to use the global location number (GLN) as an identification number in electronic documents.
5. Close the page.

## Other setup

Before you start to work with e-documents, set up the e-document **workflows** and **document sending profiles** to use your workflows. After the service connection is established, you can start to use your e-document solution.

## Available service providers

Microsoft wants to encourage access point providers to add their connectors on top of our **E-Document Core** app.

The following list of access point providers are covered by default:  

- Avalara
- B2BRouter
- Continia
- Logiq
- Pagero
- SignUp

Microsoft has no contractual obligations with these providers. Therefore, you must make a contract with them to get the necessary credentials. The services might require extra licensing or payments for their services.

# Add and View Notes on Records
 You <!--OnPrem and your colleagues -->can add notes to records in the application. Many pages, particularly those that display a list of records, such as the **Sales Orders** page, include the **Notes** action or the **Notes** FactBox. <!--OnPrem Notes is where you can write notes about a record to yourself or others, and where you can view notes to you from others. For example, a note could be a general comment or processing instruction to your colleague, who can then respond to your note using their own **Notes**. Or, your colleague can add a note that gives you extra information about a sales order that is not covered by the information on the sales order. These notes and correspondences will follow the record as it is processed in the company.-->

# Undo Assembly Posting

Undo the posting of an assembly order to correct a mistake or remove an unwanted posting.

When you undo a posted assembly order, corrective item ledger entries are created to reverse the original entries. Each positive output entry for the assembly item is reversed by a negative output entry. Each negative consumption entry for an assembly component is reversed by a positive consumption entry. Fixed cost application is automatically created between the corrective and original entries to ensure exact cost reversal.  

When you undo a fully posted assembly order, you can recreate the original order. For example, to make corrections before you post it again.  

When you undo a partially posted assembly order, all affected quantity fields, such as the **Assembled Quantity**, **Consumed Quantity**, and **Remaining Quantity** fields, are restored to the values they had before the posting.  

To recreate or restore assembly orders, the item in the original posting must meet the following conditions:  

* It's still in inventory. That is, it hasn't been sold or otherwise consumed by outbound transactions.  
* It isn't reserved.  
* It's in the bin that it was output to.  

Assembly orders can only be restored if the number and sequence of lines on the original assembly order aren't changed.  

> [!TIP]  
> To resolve conflicts caused by changes in the lines, manually revert the changes on the lines in question before undoing the posted assembly order. You can post the assembly order and then recreate it when you undo the posting.  

The following procedure describes how to undo posted assembly orders that contain items that were assembled-to-stock. To undo posted assembly orders with items that were assembled-to-order, use the **Undo Shipment** action on the related posted shipment. To learn more about undoing shipments, go to [Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments](finance-how-reverse-journal-posting.md). Undoing the posted assembly order happens in the same way as described in that article.  

## To undo posting of an assembly order

You can undo fully or partially posted assembly orders.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Assembly Orders**, and choose the related link.  

   Each partial posting creates a separate posted assembly order.  
2. Open the posted assembly order that you want to undo, and then choose the **Undo Assembly** action.  

    If the posted assembly order is related to a fully posted assembly order that's been deleted, you can recreate then deleted order. For example, you might recreate the order because you want to reprocess it.  
3. To recreate the assembly order, choose **Yes**. To undo the posting without recreating the assembly order, choose **No**.  

The **Reversed** field on the assembly order changes to **Yes**. The assembly order posting is now reversed. You can process the entire assembly order if you chose to recreate it, or the open assembly order that you have restored to its original state.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To restore quantities from multiple partial postings in an assembly order, you must undo all the posted assembly orders by following steps 1 through 3.

# The Basic Experience extension

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

If you have been using Microsoft Dynamics C5, Microsoft partners can help you transition to a more modern solution that is based on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], so you can continue to enjoy the same streamlined capabilities as Dynamics C5.

This extension is intended for small businesses and can support up to three users. If you need more users, you must upgrade to a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license and uninstall this extension.

> [!NOTE]
> As of now, this extension is available only to customers in Denmark and Iceland.

## What's available

The following table describes the capabilities that are available if you install the Basic Experience extension.

|Area  |Functionality  |
|---------|---------|
|**General Ledger** |Basic finance, financial reports, fixed assets, bank management, bank reconciliation, payments, direct debit, dimensions, multiple currencies, budgets, workflow, document management/OCR, consolidation, unlimited companies|
|**Accounts Receivable/Sales** |Basic receivables, sales invoicing, sales discounts, pricing, sales tax, contact management |
|**Accounts Payable/Purchase** |Basic payables, purchase invoicing |
|**Project Management** |Jobs, job pricing, time sheets, assignments, tasks, resources |
|**Inventory** |Basic inventory, item substitutions, item cross reference |

## Getting started

This extension is a bit different than most, and you'll need help from a Microsoft partner to install and set it up. So that you know what to expect, here's a high-level view of what the Microsoft partner does.

1. Create a new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant. This can be either a trial or a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) version.
2. Add at least one user who is assigned to a Basic Experience license in your Microsoft Entra account.
3. Remove all companies, including the sample Cronus company.
4. Create a new company that doesn't contain any sample data or setups.
5. Add the **Demo RapidStart** package. <!--what does the package contain?-->
6. Download and install the Basic Experience extension from AppSource.

## Migrating data

Bring your Dynamics C5 data along. After your Microsoft partner installs the Basic Experience extension, you'll have an empty company. An easy way to move your data from Dynamics C5 to Basic Experience is to use the C5 Data Migration extension, which is included in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The extension migrates customers, vendors, items, and your general ledger accounts and their entries.

# Manage Many Incoming Document Records

As you create or process incoming document records, the number of lines on the **Incoming Documents** page may grow to an extent where you lose overview. Therefore, you can set incoming document records to *Processed* to remove them from the default view. When you choose the **Show All** action, you can view both processed and unprocessed records.

> [!NOTE]  
> You cannot edit information, attach files, or perform other processes on incoming document records that are set to *Processed*. You must first set it to *Unprocessed*.

The **Processed** check box is automatically selected on incoming document records that have been processed, but you can also select or deselect the check box manually. Depending on your business process, an incoming document record may be processed when a related document has been created for it or a file has been attached.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you open the **Incoming Documents** page with the **My Incoming Documents** action on the Role Center, only unprocessed incoming document records are shown by default. This is referred to in this topic as "the default view".

## To remove incoming document records from the default view

1. On the **Incoming Documents** page, select one or more lines for incoming document records that you want to remove from the default view.
2. Choose the **Set to Processed** action.

    The incoming document records are removed from the default view, and the **Processed** check box is selected on the lines.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also perform this action for the individual record on the **Incoming Document Card** page.

## To view all incoming document records

1. On the **Incoming Documents** page, choose the **Show All** action.

All incoming document records are displayed, including records where the **Processed** check box isn't selected.

## To add incoming document records to the default view

1. On the **Incoming Documents** page, choose the **Show All** action.
2. Select one or more lines for incoming document records that you want to appear in the default view.
3. Choose the **Set to Unprocessed** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also perform this action for the individual record on the **Incoming Document Card** page.

# Service Order Status and Repair Status

The **Status** field on the **Service Order** page and the service item repair status, which is represented by the **Repair Status Code** field on the **Service Order** page have a certain relationship in Service Management. The service order status reflects the repair status of all the service items in the service order.  

> [!NOTE]  
> These two status field are not related to the **Release Status** field on the service order header, which determines how the warehouse handles service items.  

Each time the repair status of a service item is changed in a service order, the status of the order is updated. To display the status that reflects the overall repair status of the individual service items, you must specify the following:  

* The service order status that each repair status is linked to.  
* The level of priority of each service order status option.  

When you convert a service quote to a service order, the repair status of each service item is changed in the order to **Initial** and the service order status is changed to **Pending**.  

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can create service orders, you must set up repair statuses and service status priorities. For more information, see [Set Up Statuses for Service Orders and Repairs](service-order-repair-status.md).

## Specifying Service Order Status for Repair Status

Each repair status is linked to a particular service order status. The options for the service order status are as follows:

* **Pending**
* **In Process**
* **On Hold**
* **Finished**

The repair status options are as follows:

* **Initial**
* **In Process**
* **Referred**
* **Partly Serviced**
* **Quote Finished**
* **Waiting for Customer**
* **Spare Part Ordered**
* **Spare Part Received**
* **Finished**  

### Pending

The service order status **Pending** indicates that the service can start or continue at any time. Therefore, the repair status options of **Initial**, **Referred**, **Partly Serviced**, and **Spare Part Received** can be linked to this service order status.  

### In Process

The service order status **In Process** indicates that the service is in process. Therefore, the repair status options **In Process** and **Spare Part Ordered** can both be linked to this service order status. If you link the **Spare Part Ordered** status to an **In Process** service order status, you must also link the **Spare Part Received** status to this service order status.  

### On Hold

The service order status **On Hold** indicates that the service is temporarily on hold because you are waiting for a customer response or spare parts before the service can start. Therefore, the repair status options of **Quote Finished**, **Spare Part Ordered**, and **Waiting for Customer** can be linked to this service order status.  

### Finished

The service order status **Finished** indicates that the service has been completed. Therefore, the **Finished** repair status is linked to this status.  

## Assigning Priority to Service Order Status

When a repair status of a service item is changed, the service order status options linked to the different repair status options of all the service items in the order are identified. If the service items are linked to two or more service order status options, the service order status option with the highest priority is selected.  

You must decide which service order status contains the most important information about the status of the service order and assign that status the highest priority, and so on.  

Then, when you create a new service order and you add service items to it, the **Priority** field on the service order header is updated based on the priorities on the service items.  

### Example

A typical priority level assignment could be as follows:  

* In Process - High  
* Pending - Medium high  
* On Hold - Medium low  
* Finished - Low  

For example, if one service item has the repair status **Initial**, linked to the service order status **Pending**, another has the repair status **In Process**, linked to the service order status **In Process**, and a third has the repair status **Spare Part Ordered**, linked to the service order status **On Hold**, the resulting service order status will be **In Process** because this has the highest priority.

# Liquidity (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Liquidity Report is designed to help you evaluate your company's short-term financial health by focusing on three key performance indicators: Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, and Cash Ratio. These ratios, along with their supporting details, allow you to assess your ability to meet current liabilities.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/liquidity-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Liquidity report" lightbox="media/finance/liquidity-report.png":::

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Executives
- Directors
- Other high-level decision makers

Executives use the report to analyze the company's financial stability and help ensure there's sufficient cash flow for ongoing operations. For a broad perspective of liquidity, you could assess the current ratio. The current ratio compares current assets to current liabilities. This helps assess day-to day operational stability.

For a more conservative assessment, you can analyze the quick ratio, which removes inventory and purchase prepayments from the equation. This ratio focuses on cash and assets that you can quickly convert to cash, such as accounts receivable.  

Finally, you could review the cash ratio, which focuses on liquid assets to meet financial obligations. This perspective is the most conservative, and focuses on cash and cash equivalents to meet current liabilities.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Liquidity* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Current Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-ratio)
- [**Quick Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#quick-ratio)
- [**Cash Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#cash-ratio)
- [**Current Assets**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-assets)
- [**Current Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-liabilities)
- [**Inventory**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#inventory)
- [**Purchase Prepayments**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-prepayments)
- [**Liquid Assets**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#liquid-assets)

# FAQ for mapping e-documents with purchase orders using Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of **E-documents Matching Assistance** feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is E-documents Matching Assistance?

Electronic documents (e-documents) serve as the foundation for modern business transactions. They represent critical paperwork such as invoices and receipts that flow in both directions through delivery and receipt. You can generate and transmit electronic invoices digitally in a structured format that facilitates automated invoice processing. However, handling incoming digital invoices can be more intricate for accounts payable teams.  

In small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), the accounts payable team plays a pivotal role in accurately tracking vendor obligations. Their primary responsibility is to accurately record incoming invoices. Achieving precision can require effort, particularly when they reconcile external invoices from vendors with existing purchase orders. Discrepancies in codes, descriptions, and units of measurement often present challenges because these elements might not match across different systems and companies. Also, unexpected costs, such as transportation fees, might appear as separate line items that need manual adjustment. Accountants must also include invoice numbers and dates in the documents. Importantly, the relationship between purchase orders and external invoices isn't always one-to-one. You might receive multiple external invoices for the same purchase order.

Historically, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] could generate new purchase invoices based on received electronic invoices. However, manually matching invoices with existing purchase orders was a time-consuming and error-prone process.

**E-documents Matching Assistance** uses generative AI to streamlines this process by automating the analysis of external electronic invoices. The feature allows accountants to ask Copilot to match lines on incoming electronic invoices with lines on purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What are capabilities of the E-documents Matching Assistance?

Copilot provides AI-powered assistance to match received digital invoice with existing purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Copilot matches lines based on the following:

- Similarity of descriptions
- Units of measure
- Quantities available for invoicing
- Amounts

Copilot identifies similar descriptions if they have proper unit of measures and the prices, but it can also find matches in more complex cases. For example, it can identify if an electronic invoice has two lines with a variant of the same item, and just one line in the purchase order; [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches these lines as long as the descriptions are similar and the prices are the same.

Copilot doesn't connect to your e-documents endpoint service to retrieve or send digital vouchers. This task remains fully within your control and is a prerequisite to using Copilot's assistance. This is true, regardless of whether the digital documents are added to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using a connection with an endpoint service or entered manually.  

## What is the intended use of the E-documents Matching Assistance?  

The goal of the **E-documents Matching Assistance** feature is to assist the accounts payable team match existing purchase orders with incoming electronic invoices. Much of this activity revolves around string matching. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a feature that automates some of this activity, and LLMs have been identified as an opportunity to supplement that feature and further reduce manual effort.  

## How was E-documents Matching Assistance evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

This feature was tested using combinations of the following information:

- External item descriptions
- Units of measure
- Quantities and amounts
- Standard item descriptions
- Different languages
- Other parameters that cover the typical variations and data limits for each field 

Test data represents both typical use and use by bad actors. Performance was measured compared to manual matching the same data in electronic invoices and purchase orders.

## What are the limitations of E-documents Matching Assistance? How can users minimize the impact of the E-documents Matching Assistance limitations when using the system?

**E-documents Matching Assistance** performs best when external (e-invoice) and internal ([!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) item descriptions, and unit of measures are all in the same language. Mixed languages or mixed language of item descriptions often result in fewer matches and suggestions.  

Suggested matching of items from e-invoices with items in purchase orders performs best in English language. Although you can use this feature in any language that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports, you might experience fewer item matches in other languages. Learn more in the section [In which geographies and languages is E-documents Matching Assistance available?](#in-which-geographies-and-languages-is-e-documents-matching-assistance-available).

## In which geographies and languages is E-documents Matching Assistance available?

[!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only.md)]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

Copilot supplements the mapping algorithm that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] already provides and maps the lines that the algorithm didn't.

### What is expected of users while using E-Documents Matching Assistance?

<!--Not sure that this is the right content for this section. Seems like it belongs more in the overview article because it's more related to how to use the feature-->

After you map incoming electronic invoices with purchase orders, you must map the lines on the documents.

The **Purchase Order Mapping** page shows all lines from both of documents. Here, you can do the mapping manually, which can be difficult if there are many lines.

You can use **E-Documents Matching Assistance** to map lines based on the following criteria:

- Similarity in their descriptions
- Units of measure
- Quantities available for invoicing
- Amounts

Copilot's matches might be incorrect or incomplete. You should always review their accuracy before you choose to keep them. Copilot’s matches and suggestions are saved in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when you choose **Keep it** and exit Copilot. You can edit and correct any matches or suggestions before you choose to keep them. 

### What is expected of administrators and users when operating E-Documents Matching Assistance?

Users, such as accountants or others who receive e-invoices, should always review the accuracy of matches and suggestions provided by Copilot before choosing to keep them. We recommend that you review the purchase order lines to verify their accuracy and find any discrepancies. You decide whether to use the **E-Documents Matching Assistance**. Even when the **E-Documents Matching Assistance** is enabled by administrators and available, you can still choose to use it always, sometimes, or never.  

Administrators make the overall decision on whether to use Copilot in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If they enable Copilot, administrators should ensure they grant access to the appropriate.

> [NOTE!]
> - We don't support the feature for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or in private clouds.
> - Partners can't extend this feature. Partner developers can't modify, replace, or extend this feature. 

## Is Copilot the only way to match e-documents to purchase orders?  

No, whether you use Copilot is up to you. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers non-AI-powered ways to match items from received electronic invoice with items on purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Organizations can also use both approaches at the same time.  

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?  

Each time Copilot provides matches or suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window, using the **Like** and **Dislike** controls. Your feedback remains anonymous, and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

title: Set up projects, prices, and project posting groups
description: Describes how to set up general information about projects.

# Set up projects, prices, and project posting groups

As a project manager, you can set up each of the projects that you manage in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Use the **Project Setup** page to define how you'll use project features.

For each project, specify various information:

* Prices for project items
* Project resources
* Project G/L accounts
* Project posting groups (required)

## To set general information for projects

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The **Apply Usage Link by Default** toggle on the **Projects Setup** page indicates whether project ledger entries are linked to project planning lines by default. Turn on the toggle to apply this setting to all new projects. You can enable or disable project usage tracking for a specific project by turning the **Apply Usage Link** toggle on or off on the **Project Card** page. The **Apply Usage Link** toggle also activates warehouse handling, planning, assembly-to-order, item tracking, and reservation capabilities for project.

### To set up project usage tracking

When you're working on a project, you might want to know how your usage is tracking against your plan. To explore usage, you can create a link between your project planning lines and the actual usage. The link lets you track your costs and understand how much work remains. By default, the project planning line type is **Budget**, but using the line type **Both Budget and Billable** has similar effects.

After you set up usage tracking by turning on the **Apply Usage Link by Default** toggle, you can review information on the project planning line. For example, you can set the quantity of the resource, item, or general ledger account. You can also set the quantity to transfer to the project journal. The **Remaining Quantity** field on the project planning line shows what remains to transfer and post to the project journal.

>[!NOTE]
> If the **Apply Usage Link** is chosen on the project, and the **Line Type** field on the project journal line or purchase line is **Billable**, new project planning lines of the line type **Both Budget and Billable** are created when you post the project journal or purchase document.  
>
> For more information, see [Record Usage for Projects](projects-how-record-job-usage.md) and [Manage Project Supplies](projects-how-manage-project-supplies.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't specify a value in the **Line Type** field on the project journal line or purchase line, project planning lines aren't created when you post the project journal or purchase document.

### Invoice multiple customers for project tasks

When projects involve multiple customers, billing the right customers for the right tasks can be challenging. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes billing less complex by letting you specify the bill-to and sell-to customers on each project task line, so you can automatically generate invoices for the correct customers.  Use the **Default Task Billing Method** field to specify whether you're billing one customer, or multiple customers by default. You can change task billing method for a specific project by using the **Task Billing Method** field on the **Project Card** page. To learn more about invoicing multiple customers, go to [Invoice one or more customers for project tasks](projects-how-create-jobs.md#invoice-one-or-more-customers-for-project-tasks).

### Synchronize the cost of used items

The cost of an item (inventory value) that you purchase and later use in project might change during its lifetime. For example, because a freight cost is added to its purchase cost after you post the usage of the item.

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can manually or automatically adjust item costs. The adjustment is reflected in the value entries and general ledger. To learn more, go to [Managing Inventory Cost](finance-manage-inventory-costs.md)

In relation to projects, you also have options for how to reflect those adjustments.

To ensure that cost changes automatically adjust in a project each time the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job is run, turn on the **Automatic Update Project Item Cost** toggle.

If you keep it off, remember to run the **Update Job Project Cost** task manually or by using a job queue entry.

## To set up prices for resources, items, and general ledger accounts for projects

> [!NOTE]
> In 2020 release wave 2, we released new processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you are using the new experience depends on whether your administrator has enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. For more information, see [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

You can set up prices for the items, resources, and general ledger accounts related to a project. 

#### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the project, and then choose the **Resource**, **Item**, or **G/L Account** action.
3. On the **Project Resource Prices**, **Project Item Prices**, or **Project G/L Account Prices** pages, fill in the fields as necessary.

When you choose a resource, item, or general ledger account for a project, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses information in the optional fields on project planning lines and project journals. The following table explains how.

|Column1  |Column2  |
|---------|---------|
|**Project Items**|The **Project Task No.**, **Currency Code**, and **Line Discount %** fields. The value in the **Unit Price** field for the item will be used on the project planning lines and project journals when this item is entered. This price overrides the regular customer price (the "best price" mechanism) for items. To use the regular customer price, don't specify project item prices for the project.|
|**General Ledger Accounts**|The information in the **Project Task No.**, **Currency Code**, **Line Discount %**, **Unit Cost Factor**, and **Unit Cost** fields will be used on the project planning lines and project journals when this general ledger account is entered and added to a project. When you choose a general ledger account, project planning lines and project journals use the value in the **Unit Price** field for the general ledger project expense.|
|**Project Resources**|The **Project Task No.**, **Work Type**, **Currency Code**, **Line Discount %**, and **Unit Cost Factor** fields. The value in the **Unit Price** field for the resource is used on project planning lines and project journals when you enter a resource, or a resource assigned to the resource group. This price overrides prices specified on the **Resource Price/Resource Group Prices** page.|

#### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant project, and then choose the **Sales Price Lists** action.

---

## To set up project posting groups

One aspect of planning projects is deciding which posting accounts to use for project costing. To be able to post projects, you set up accounts for posting for each project posting group. A posting group represents a link between the project and how it should be treated in the general ledger. When you create a project, you specify a posting group, and by default, each task you create for the project is associated with that posting group. However, as you create tasks, you can override the default and select a posting group that is more appropriate.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must set up accounts in the chart of accounts before you set up posting groups. For more information, see [Set Up or Change the Chart of Accounts](finance-setup-chart-accounts.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

| Account field | Description | Used in WIP Type |
| --- | --- |  --- |
| **Code** |An identifier for the posting group. You can enter up to 10 characters, including spaces. | |
| **WIP Costs Account** |The WIP account for the calculated cost of the project WIP, which is a balance sheet capital asset account. | Applied Cost, Recognized Costs|
| **WIP Accrued Costs Account** |An account for the Cost Value or Cost of Sales method of WIP calculation. This account is for accrued expense liability on your balance sheet. When a WIP adjustment requires you to increase the usage costs that you post to your income statement, you post to this account. | Accrued Costs|
| **Project Costs Applied Account** |A balancing account to the WIP Costs Account, which is a contra for a negative expense account. Used when **WIP Posting Method Used** is set to *Project*. | Applied Costs, Recognized Costs|
| **Item Costs Applied Account** |Same as  **Project Costs Applied Account**, but used when **WIP Posting Method Used** is set to *Project Ledger Entry*.| |
| **Resource Costs Applied Account** |Same as  **Project Costs Applied Account**, but used when **WIP Posting Method Used** is set to *Project Ledger Entry*.| |
| **G/L Costs Applied Account** |Same as  **Project Costs Applied Account**, but used when **WIP Posting Method Used** is set to *Project Ledger Entry*.| |
| **Project Costs Adjustment Account** |The balancing account to the WIP Accrued Costs account, which is an expense account. | Accrued Costs|
| **G/L Expense Acc. (Budget)** |The sales account that will be used for general ledger expenses in project tasks with this posting group. If left empty, the general ledger account entered on the project planning line is used. | |
| **WIP Accrued Sales Account** |The WIP account for the calculated sales value of the WIP, which is an accrued revenue account for your balance sheet. When a WIP adjustment requires you to increase the recognized revenue, you post to this account. | Accrued Sales, Recognized Sales|
| **WIP Invoiced Sales Account** |The account for the invoiced sales value of the WIP that is not able to be recognized. It is a balance sheet Unearned Revenue account. | Recognized Sales, Applied Sales|
| **Project Sales Applied Account** |The balancing account to the WIP Invoiced Sales account, which is a contra income account. | Applied Sales, Recognized Sales|
| **Project Sales Adjustment Account** |The balancing account to the WIP Project Sales Account, which is an income account. | Accrued Sales|
| **Recognized Costs Account** |The expense account that contains the recognized costs for the project. It is a debit expense account ordinarily. | Recognized Costs|
| **Recognized Sales Account** |The income account that contains the recognized income for the project. It is a credit income account ordinarily. | Recognized Sales|

### Allow multiple people to post project transactions at the same time

To allow people to post transactions for projects at the same time, you can enable the **Enable multiple users to post job ledger entries at the same time** feature update on the **Feature Management** page. By default, the feature isn’t enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Similar features are available for resource, inventory, and warehouse entries. To learn more, go to:
>
> * [Allow multiple people to post resource transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-resources.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-resource-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Allow workers to post inventory transactions at the same time](inventory-how-setup-general.md#allow-workers-to-post-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Design details: Creating warehouse entries](design-details-warehouse-entries.md)

If you enable the feature, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns entry numbers for each table from `SequenceNumbers` in the database, which allows people to post transactions at the same time. The result can be that sometimes entries from two or more transactions are interleaved.

There's a similar feature for inventory transactions. An item register might contain any or all of the entry tables, as shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="media/interleaved inventory tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the item register with several entry tables." lightbox="media/interleaved inventory tables.png":::

If you don’t enable the feature, when someone posts a transaction the tables are locked and other users can’t post. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in each table and assigns a number that’s one higher. This numbering ensures that entries that belong to the same register are consecutive, but prevents other people from posting at the same time.

> [!NOTE]
> You might not want to enable the feature if you have a feature or extension that:
>
> * Relies on consecutive entry numbers.
> * Requires that tables are locked throughout the posting process.

# Multiple VAT registration numbers 

For businesses with warehouses in multiple EU countries, managing VAT (Value Added Tax) can be challenging, as each warehouse location requires a different VAT number to comply with the specific regulations of each country. This article provides information about this requirement and explains the functionality for multiple value-added tax (VAT) registration numbers. This functionality allows users to set up tax registration numbers for their customers in different countries/regions.  

> [!NOTE]
> The *Multiple VAT numbers for customers* functionality is available only from Business Central 2024 release wave 2 (version 25).

## How to set up the alternative VAT registration numbers  

To set up the alternative VAT registration numbers for different countries/regions, follow these steps: 

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Alternative Customer VAT Registration**, and then select the related link. 
2. Add the customer in the **Customer No** field and the country/region related to this VAT registration in the **VAT Country/Region Code**.  
3. You must add the VAT number in the **VAT Registration No.** field. You must stick to the format when you use **Country/Region Code**. 
4. If you want to use different VAT or general posting groups, you can alternatively add them to the setup in the **VAT Bus. Posting Group** and **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** fields. 
5. Close the page.   

To create an alternative address for your customer, follow these steps:  

1. Open the **Customer** card for the customer you want to add new **Ship-to Address**. 
2. Select **Customer**, and choose the **Ship-to Addresses** action.   
3. The **Ship-to Address List** page opens, and select **New**. 
4. Fill in the information about your customer's ship-to destination.  
5. Choose the proper **Country/Region Code**.   
6. If you have already configured a new **VAT Registration No.** on the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** for this country or region, nothing will happen. 
  - But if you didn't configure the **VAT Registration No.** previously on the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** for this country or region, the following notification appears: **Click Add if you want to insert the Alternative VAT Registration for this Ship-To Country Code.**
  - Choose the **Add** action on the notification and the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** page opens.
This page populates your **Customer No.** and the **VAT Country/Region Code**. So, you just need to add the setup that you want to use. 

## Work with the sales documents   

You can create new [sales invoice](sales-how-invoice-sales.md) or [sales order](sales-how-sell-products.md) in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you need to use a ship-to address that differs from the customer's address and is located in a different country, follow the steps:  

### Alternate shipping address  

1. Expand the **Shipping and Billing** FastTab.   
2. In the Ship-to field, choose the **Alternate Shipping Address** option. 
3. The **Ship-to Address List** page with available alternate addresses appears. 
4. Choose one of the addresses with a different **Country/Region Code**. 
5. The **Confirm Alternative Customer VAT Registration** dialog page appears with a list of fields that you have modified because of the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** setup change. 
6. Select **OK** to confirm.   

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't want to confirm such a choice anymore, you can select the **Don't show again** field, and in the future you won't see this type of notification about changes. But if you want to enable it again, you can do it by enabling the **Confirm Alternative VAT Registration** field on the **VAT Setup**.  
   
7. Once you confirm, the values are overwritten with the values from the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** setup. You can check all the VAT related fields that are under the **Invoice Details** FastTab.  
8. Post the document.  

### Custom address  

In case you don't have the ship-to address configured but still want to use a different address for shipping, you can use this option.  

1. Expand the **Shipping and Billing** FastTab.   
2. In the Ship-to field, choose the **Custom Address** option.  
3. Change the country in the **Country/Region** field.  
4. Once you change the country/region code to match the **VAT Country/Region Code** of the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration**, the **Confirm Alternative Customer VAT Registration** dialog page appears with a list of fields that have been changed. 
5. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will also change all the VAT related fields that are under the **Invoice Details** FastTab.  

### Work with no shipment 

If there's no shipment as a process, you still can leverage the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** setup.

In the sales order or invoice, you can find the **VAT Country/Region Code** under the **Invoice Details** FastTab and specify the value that matches the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** setup. You should see the same confirmation dialog page as above. 

In this situation, you can post a sales invoice with the proper **VAT Registration No.** for your customer even if you don't ship items with this document. 

### Work with the sales credit memo  

Once you post the invoice with a **Ship-to address** or **VAT Country/Region Code** that has different posting data, the corrective **Sales credit memo** takes the values from the **Posted sales invoice** header where these values are taken from the **Alternative customer VAT registration**, so no other actions required.

# Sustainability value chain in sales

When you sell items, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the **CO2e per Unit** field from the **Item** card for each sales line that contains emission values. It uses the average calculation method to calculate the value.  

When you post all sales documents, the posted documents keep the **CO2e per Unit** and **Total CO2e** values for each line.

The result of posting shows as a new sustainability value entry for each line that has **Sale** as its **Item Ledger Entry Type**.

> [!NOTE]
> The **CO2e per Unit** and **Total CO2e** values aren't used in default report layouts. However, if you want to show these details when you print reports, you can create a new document report to show this data.

# Create prepayment invoices

If you require customers to pay before you'll ship their order, you can use the prepayment features. The same applies if your vendor requires you to pay before they ship an order to you.  

You can start the prepayment process when you create a sales or purchase order. The default prepayment percentage for an item on the order, or for the customer or vendor, will be included in the prepayment invoice. You can also specify a prepayment percentage to the entire document.

After you create a sales or purchase order, you can create a prepayment invoice for it. Either use the default percentages for each sales or purchase line, or adjust the amount. For example, you might specify a total amount for the entire order.  

The following procedure describes how to invoice a prepayment for a sales order. The steps are similar for purchase orders.  

## To create a prepayment invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new sales order for the relevant customer. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).  

    On the **Prepayment** FastTab, the **Prepayment %** field specifies the percentage to use to calculate the prepayment amount. If there's a default prepayment percentage on the customer card, the field is filled in automatically. You can change the percentage. <!--This percentage is applied to lines where the item on that line does not already specify a prepayment percentage. The prepayment percentage is only copied from the header to lines that do not copy the default prepayment percentage from the item.-->  

    Choose the **Compress Prepayment** field if you want to create lines on the prepayment invoice that combine lines from the sales order if:  

    - They have the same general ledger account for prepayments as determined by the general posting setup.  
    - They have the same dimensions.  

    If you want to specify a prepayment invoice with one line for each sales order line that has a prepayment percentage, don't choose the **Compress Prepayment** field.  

    The due date for the prepayment is calculated automatically based on the value of the **Prepmt. Payment Terms Code**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When some lines on an invoice require 100% prepayment and other lines don't, and there's VAT on the prepayment account, the rounded amount might cause an error when you create a prepayment invoice. The error occurs because the prepayment invoice amount is higher than the amounts on the document lines. To fix the problem, change the amounts on one or all of the lines that require 100% prepayment. The change will recalculate the VAT amount rounding and use the accumulated rounding difference on the last modified line.
    >
    > Two more ways to fix the problem are:
    >
    > * Create a separate VAT product posting group and a VAT posting setup with a separate VAT identifier and use that for the items or lines that require 100% prepayment. Rounding is done for each VAT identifier, so separate rounding will be done for items that are assigned to the VAT product posting group.
    > * Use a separate invoice for the items or lines that do and don't require 100% prepayments.

3. Fill in the sales lines.  

    If you've specified a default prepayment percentage either for the customer or on the **Prepayment** FastTab on this document, this value is copied to each line. You can change the contents of the **Prepayment %** field on the line.  

    > [!TIP]
    > If you do not see the **Prepayment %** field, you can add it through personalization.  For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

4. To view the total prepayment amount, choose the **Statistics** action.

    If you want to adjust the total prepayment amount for the order, you can change the contents of the **Prepayment Amount** field on the **Sales Order Statistics** page.  

    If the **Prices Including VAT** field is selected, the **Prepayment Amount Incl. VAT** field is editable.  

    If you change the contents of the **Prepayment Amount** field, the amount will be distributed proportionately between all lines, except lines that have **0** in the **Prepayment %** field.  

5. To print a test report before posting the prepayment invoice, choose the **Prepayment** action, and then choose the **Prepayment Test Report** action.  
6. To post the prepayment invoice, choose the **Prepayment** action, and then choose the **Post Prepayment Invoice** action.  

    To post and print the prepayment invoice, choose the **Post and Print Prepmt. Invoice** action.  

You can issue other prepayment invoices for the order. To issue another invoice, increase the prepayment amount on one or more lines, adjust the document date if necessary, and post the prepayment invoice. A new invoice will be created for the difference between the prepayment amounts invoiced so far and the new prepayment amount.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are located in North America, you cannot change the prepayment percentage after the prepayment invoice has been posted. This is prevented in the North American version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] because the calculation of sales tax will otherwise be incorrect.  

 When you're ready to post the rest of the invoice, post it as you would post any invoice, and the prepayment amount will automatically be deducted from the amount due.  

## Update the status of prepaid orders and invoices automatically

You can speed up order and invoice processing by setting up job queue entries that automatically update the status of those documents. When a prepayment invoice is paid, the job queue entries can automatically change the document status from **Pending Prepayment** to **Released**. When you set up the job queue entries, the codeunits you'll need to use are **384 Upd. Pending Prepmt. Sales** and **384 Upd. Pending Prepmt. Purchase**. We recommend that you schedule the entries to run frequently, for example, every minute. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

# Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview

Small and mid-sized companies rely on built-in analytics and reporting capabilities they can use out-of-the-box to help keep track of their business. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides reports and analytics tools that cover basic and complex business processes.

## Analytics needs in organizations

When you think about analytics in your organization, it might help to use a persona-based model to outline different needs.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

The model is based on the fact that different roles in an organization have different needs when it comes to data. The higher a role is placed in the organizational chart, the more aggregated data someone in the role needs to do their work.

Roles often have preferred ways to consume and analyze data, ways that reflect the level of data aggregation they need.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

Use the following sections to learn more about ways to consume data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Financial Reports
- KPIs and dashboards
- Power BI apps
- Ad-hoc analysis
- Reports

## Using Financial Reports to produce financial statements and KPIs

The Financial Reports feature gives you insight into the financial data stored in your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries.

:::image type="content" source="media/acc_schedule_13_columns.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of a financial report." lightbox="media/acc_schedule_13_columns.jpg":::

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence. A dimension is data that you can add to an entry as a parameter. Dimensions let you group entries that have similar characteristics. For example, groups of customers, regions, products, and salesperson. Groups make it easier to retrieve data for analysis. Among other purposes, you use dimensions when you define analysis views and create financial reports. Learn more at [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

To learn more about financial statements and KPIs, go to [Using Financial reporting to produce financial statements and KPIs](bi.md).

## Using key performance indicators to meet your business goals

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. Think of KPIs as your company’s scorecard, a way to measure whether you’re delivering on your objectives.

Identifying and tracking KPIs lets you know whether your business is on the right path, or whether you should change course. When used properly, KPIs are powerful tools that help you:

- Monitor company financial health.
- Measure progress against strategic goals.
- Spot problems early on.
- Make timely adjustments to tactics.
- Motivate team members.
- Make better decisions, faster.

To learn more about KPIs, go to [Using key performance indicators to meet your business goals](./analytics-about-kpis.md)

## Built-in Power BI apps 

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-apps-overview](includes/powerbi-apps-overview.md)]

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/financial-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Finance Overview report" lightbox="media/finance/financial-overview.png":::

To learn more, go to [Power BI apps/reports by functional area](across-powerbi-apps-by-functional-area.md)

## Ad-hoc data analysis

You might just want to check whether the numbers add up correctly, quickly confirm or debunk a hypothesis about the business, or maybe look for anomalies in your financial data. For ad-hoc analyses, you might not have a built-in report that helps answer your questions. For ad-hoc analyses, use these two features:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as the General Ledger Entries or Customer Ledger Entries pages, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit. 

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-gl-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the G/L entries page." lightbox="media/data-analysis-gl-entries.png":::

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

:::image type="content" source="media/open-in-excel-gl-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the G/L entries data using Excel." lightbox="media/open-in-excel-gl-entries.png":::

[!INCLUDE [onedrive-excel-online](includes/onedrive-excel-online.md)]

To learn more about ad-how analyses, go to [Ad hoc data analysis](reports-adhoc-analysis.md).

## Reports

A report in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gathers information based on a specified set of criteria. Reports organize and present the information in an easy-to-read format you can use in Excel, print, or save as a file.  

As an example of an interactive report in Excel, the **Aged Accounts Receivable** report lets you analyze what your customers owe you and when payments are due.

:::image type="content" source="media/aged-accounts-receivables-excel.png" alt-text="Example of the interactive aged accounts receivables report in Excel." lightbox="media/aged-accounts-receivables-excel.png":::

For aged accounts receivables, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also includes a report designed for print. The ability to print is handy if you prefer to have the data in a .pdf file.

:::image type="content" source="media/aged-accounts-receivables-pdf.png" alt-text="Example of the  aged accounts receivables report in pdf." lightbox="media/aged-accounts-receivables-pdf.png":::

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] comes with more than 300 built-in reports that you can use to support your business processes with data-driven insights. To get a quick overview of all the reports that are available for your role, you can open the report explorer from the role center and all list pages and from **Tell Me**.

:::image type="content" source="media/report-explorer-finance.png" alt-text="Example of how the report explorer shows all reports for a role." lightbox="media/report-explorer-finance.png":::

To learn more about using the report explorer to see all built-in reports, go to [Exploring reports per Role](ui-role-explorer.md).

# Enabling Power BI integration with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

This article describes how to get [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ready for integration with Power BI. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online is already enabled for integration, although there's some information about licensing that you might want to read. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you'll have set up your environment to connect to Power BI before users can work with it.

## <a name="license"></a>Power BI Licensing

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], users get a free Power BI license that provides access to the most common features in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Power BI. You can also purchase a Power BI Pro license that provides access to additional features. The following table provides an overview of the features available with each license.

|Power License|View reports|Create reports|Share reports|Refresh reports| [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Apps|
|-------------|--------||
|Power BI free|![a checkmark.](media/check.png) (in your personal workspace)  | ![another checkmark](media/check.png) (in your personal workspace) |(limited)|(limited)||
|Power BI Pro|![yet another checkmark.](media/check.png) |![it's a checkmark](media/check.png)|![again a checkmark](media/check.png)|(extensive)|![last checkmark](media/check.png)|

You can't use a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] free license for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Apps. To learn more, go to [Prerequisites for installing Power BI apps for Business Central](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#prerequisites)

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[about_bc_licensing_for_powerbi](includes/about_bc_licensing_for_powerbi.md)]
>
> [!INCLUDE[about_licensing](includes/about_licensing.md)]

To learn more about [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] licensing in general, go to [Licensing the Power BI service for users in your organization](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-licensing-organization) or [Sign up for the Power BI service as an individual](/power-bi/fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi).

## <a name="exposedata"></a>Expose data through API or OData web services

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers two ways to expose data that can be consumed by [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports: 

* API pages or queries
* Open Data Protocol (OData) web services

### API pages and queries (recommended)

> **APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online only.

Developers can define page objects and query objects that are of the type *API*. This way, they can expose data from database tables through a webhook-supported, OData v4-enabled, REST service. This type of data can't be displayed in the user interface, but is intended for building reliable integration services.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online comes with a set of built-in APIs that you can use to get data for typical business entities, like customers, items, sales orders, and more. No extra work or setup is required to use these APIs as a data source for [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports. To learn more about these APIs, go to [Business Central API V2.0](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/).

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online also supports custom APIs. Application developers of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] solutions can create their own API pages and queries and package them into apps. You then install the apps on your tenant. When they're installed, you use the API pages for your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports, like you'd do with the built-in APIs (v2.0). To learn more about how to create an API by exposing pages or queries, go to [Developing a Custom API](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-develop-custom-api).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting in February 2022, [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online are sourced from a secondary, read-only database replica for performance reasons. AL developers should avoid designing API pages that make database modifications while the pages are opening or loading records. In particular, consider the code on the AL triggers: `OnInit`, `OnOpenPage`, `OnFindRecord`, `OnNextRecord`, `OnAfterGetRecord`, and `OnAfterGetCurrRecord`. In some cases, these database modifications might cause performance problems and prevent the report from refreshing data. To learn more, go to [Performance Articles For Developers](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/performance/performance-developer?branch=main#writing-efficient-web-services) in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] development content.
>
> In rare cases, the behavior causes an error when you try to get data from the API for a report in Power BI Desktop. However, if the custom API requires database modifications, Power BI Desktop users can force the behavior. To learn more, go to [Building Power BI Reports to Display Business Central Data](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md#fixing-problems).

### OData web services (not recommended)

You can publish [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] application objects, such as codeunits, pages, and queries, as [OData web services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/odata-web-services). With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, there are many web services published by default. An easy way to find the web services is to search for *web services* in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On the **Web Services** page, make sure the **Publish** field is selected for the web services. To learn more about publishing web services, go to [Publish a Web Service](across-how-publish-web-service.md).

To learn about what you can do to ensure the best performance of web services, as seen from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] server (the endpoint) and from the consumer (the client), read [Writing efficient Web Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/performance/performance-developer#writing-efficient-web-services).

### Choosing whether to use API pages or OData web services

We recommend that you use API pages instead of OData web services. API pages load data faster in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports than OData web services. Plus, they're more flexible because they let you get data from table fields that aren't defined in a page object.

Stability is another reason for why you shouldn't base your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports on UI pages exposed as OData web services. Fields on UI pages in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can change between updates. The changes are done either by the app publisher (the organization that develops the code), or with per-tenant extensions or apps that modify the page. In both cases, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't know about [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] report dependencies on page objects, so the change in the UI page might break your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports. This problem doesn't happen if you base your reports on API pages or queries.

<!--## <a name="setup"></a>Set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises for Power BI integration

This section explains the requirements for a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises deployment to integrate with Power BI.

1. Configure either [NavUserPassword](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/authenticating-users-with-navuserpassword) or [Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/authenticating-users-with-azure-ad-overview) as the authentication method for the deployment.  
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Power BI integration doesn't support Windows authentication and is not supported on Windows Client.

2. Enable OData web services and the ODataV4 endpoint.

    OData web service must be enabled on the [!INCLUDE[server](includes/server.md)], and OData port opened in firewall. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server - OData Web Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#ODataServices).

    The local server must be accessible from the Internet.

3. Give [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user accounts a web service access key.

    A web service access key is only needed to view [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data in Power BI. You can assign a web service access key to each user account. Or instead, create a specific account with a web service access key for use by all users. For more information, see [Web Services Authentication](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/web-services-authentication#generate-a-web-service-access-key).

    <!--
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online, the use of access keys (Basic Auth) for web service authentication is [deprecated](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1#accesskeys). We recommend that you use OAuth2 instead. For more information, see [Use OAuth to Authorize Business Central Web Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/authenticate-web-services-using-oauth).-->

<!--4. Create an application registration for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Microsoft Azure.

    To view Power BI reports embedded in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] pages, an application must be registered for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Microsoft Azure. The registered application needs permission to Power BI services. At a minimum, the app requires  **User.ReadWrite.All** permission. For users to view reports from shared Power BI workspaces, the app requires **Workspace.Read.All** permission. For more information, see [Registering [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] On-Premises in Microsoft Entra ID for Integrating with Other Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your deployment uses NavUserPassword authentication, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connects to the same Power BI service for all users. You'll specify this service account as part of registering the application. With Microsoft Entra authentication, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connects to the Power BI service associated with the individual user accounts.

    <!-- Windows authentication can also be used but you can't get data from BC in Power BI -->
<!--5. Make the initial connection from Business Central to Power BI.

    Before end-users can use Power BI in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an Azure application administrator will have to give consent to the Power BI service.

    To make the initial connection, open [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and run **Get Started with Power BI** from the Home page. This action will lead you through the consent process, and check your Power BI license. When prompted sign in using an Microsoft Entra admin account. For more information, see [Connect to Power BI - one time only](across-working-with-powerbi.md#connect).-->

## Setting up Dataflows

Dataflows enable you to ingest, transform, and load data into a Power BI workspace and then use the data as the basis for your reports. These dataflows can in some cases experience transient errors while doing a scheduled refresh. The error message looks like this: `DataSource.Error: OData: Unable to read data from the transport connection: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.` 

Using PowerAutomate, you can set up retries for this situation. For more information, see [Automatically retry a dataflow on failure](/power-query/dataflows/automatically-retry-dataflow).

# Export your business data to Excel

Excel is a powerful tool to work with data. From inside [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can open any list in Excel. You can even modify data in Excel and then submit it back to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The same capability makes it easy for you to take your data with you if you decide to cancel your subscription.

## Opening and exporting lists in Excel

You can open data in Excel from any journal, list, or worksheet. You just open the page that you want, and then choose **Open in Excel**. For example, open the list of customers (search for **Customers**), and then choose **Open in Excel**. Your browser prompts you to open or save the generated Excel workbook.  

> [!NOTE]
> Use this option when you don't want to publish your changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

Each list includes some columns. The export to Excel includes any columns that are in your current view. Change the columns by opening the shortcut menu for any column, and then specifying which columns that you want to see. The list of columns is different for most lists. The columns reflect the structure in the database that stores your data. If you aren't sure what type of data a certain column contains, add it to your view. You can always remove it again.  

Learn more in [View and edit in Excel from Business Central](across-work-with-excel.md).

### Edit data in Excel

Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] experience includes an add-in for Excel so you can edit data in Excel. Learn more in [Analyzing Financial Statements in Microsoft Excel](finance-analyze-excel.md).  

## Exporting data to other finance systems

If you decide to cancel your subscription for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can export your data to Excel and take it with you to your next finance system.  

You can export all pages, but that might be more than you really need. Consider exporting the following essential pages, and remember to add all columns:  

* Chart of Accounts  
* Customers  
* Vendors  
* Banks  
* Items  

If you want to export all your financial transactions, it's a large amount of data, so the export often takes more than a few minutes. The financial transactions are shown on the **General Ledger Entries** page.  

We recommend that you also consider exporting data from the following pages:  

* Customer Ledger Entries  
* Vendor Ledger Entries  
* Bank Account Ledger Entries  
* Item Ledger Entries  
* General Posting Setup  
* Customer Posting Groups  
* Vendor Posting Groups  
* Item Posting Groups  
* Bank Posting Group  
* G/L Budgets  
* G/L Budget Entries  
* Sales Quotes  
* Sales Invoices  
* Purchase Invoices  
* Contacts  
* Salespeople  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you have set up more than one company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must export the relevant data from each company.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have at least one of the following permissions to open or edit data in Excel:
>
> * Permission set *D365 Excel Export Action*  
> * System permission 6110 *Allow Action Export To Excel*.  

For more information, see [Get an overview of a user's permissions](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#get-an-overview-of-a-users-permissions).

# Design details: Item tracking and planning
Because they are stored in the reservation system, item tracking numbers are fully coordinated with order tracking records. This means that items with order tracking records can be assigned item tracking numbers. Conversely, items that have item tracking numbers can become order tracking records. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Tracking Design](design-details-item-tracking-design.md).

For more information about the integrated systems, see [Design Details: Reservations, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).

Because order tracking is only concerned with specific item application, the coordination with item tracking numbers only applies to items that are set up to use specific item tracking. This is set by the **SN Specific Tracking** and **Lot Specific Tracking** fields on the item card, which specify the following:

- The item must carry a serial number or lot number when it is posted.
- The item must apply to the same serial number or lot number when it is posted outbound.

In alignment with standard supply/demand balancing principles, the planning system and the related order tracking feature only match supply and demand carrying item tracking numbers if the item in question uses specific item tracking. In all other cases, the planning and order tracking systems ignore item tracking numbers when they apply supply to meet demand or apply demand to supply. For more information, see [Design Details: Reservation, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).

For example, when order tracking exists for a given item, it implies that records for the item are already in the **Reservation Entry** table, which is the core of the reservation system, before the item tracking numbers are defined. Therefore, the following coupling restrictions apply to the item tracking numbers to be order tracked:

- Demand with a serial number or lot number can only cover supply with the same serial number or lot number.
- Demand without a serial or lot number can cover any supply, with or without a serial or lot number.

Apart from their consequences on dynamic order tracking, the item tracking coupling restrictions do not affect the planning system significantly.

On the supply side, a serial or lot number is typically not entered until immediately before the order is posted, such as a purchase receipt into the warehouse. When entering a serial or lot number on the demand side, such as on a sales order, that serial or lot number is already in inventory. Accordingly, item tracking numbers are typically not an issue in supply planning.

For items that use specific item tracking, all demand carrying serial or lot numbers must be matched by corresponding supply. In most cases, it does not make sense to reorder a specific serial or lot number, so the planning of purchase or production supplies is probably not affected. However, when transferring items from one location to another, it is likely that the transfer is for a specific lot, so planning transfer supplies might be affected by the specific coupling restriction.

For more information, see [Design Details: Transfers in Planning](design-details-transfers-in-planning.md).

## Balancing demand and supply
If an item requires specific item tracking, then an order tracking link is made from all the item’s item tracking demand to any corresponding item tracking supply, with the sole limitation that supply should come before demand. If, under those circumstances, no item tracking supply can be found that corresponds to the item tracking-specific demand, then a new item tracking supply is created immediately and without considering order sizing, planning parameters, or rescheduling of existing supply of the same serial or lot number.

If item tracking numbers are assigned on the demand side or on the supply side without requiring specific item tracking, then an order track link is made from the demand to that supply, based on the most suitable timing and quantity, as in the usual balancing procedure. The specified item tracking number goes into the order tracking record in the same way that any specified item tracking quantity defines one end of the order tracking link. This means that the item tracking number that is entered is preserved while it is also part of the order tracking record.

If item tracking numbers are assigned on the supply side without requiring specific item tracking, then this supply is regarded as fixed by the planning system. No resizing or rescheduling is suggested for this supply, but the supply is taken into consideration when the planning system tries to meet the gross requirements.

For more information, see [Design Details: Balancing Demand and Supply](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md).

# Run and print reports in Business Central

Reports help you collect and display data based on specific criteria. It organizes and presents the information in an easy-to-read format you can print or save as a file. There are many reports you can access throughout the application. The reports typically provide information related to the context of the page you're on. For example, the **Customer** page includes reports for the top 10 customers, sales statistics, and more.

> [!NOTE]
> Batch jobs and XMLports do more or less the same as reports, but are used more to process or export data. For example, the **Create Reminders** batch job creates reminder documents to send to customers with overdue payments. This article refers mainly to "reports", but similar information applies to batch jobs and XMLports.

## Get started

You can find reports in the **Reports** menu on selected pages, lists, and cards. You can also use the search ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do.") to find reports by name. For an overview of built-in reports, you can use in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], sorted by categories, go to [Report overview](reports-available-reports.md).

When you choose a report, a request page titled after the report's name where you set various options and filters that determine what data is included is available. The following sections explain how to use the request page to build, preview, and print a report.

## <a name="SavedSettings"></a>Use default values&mdash;predefined settings

Most report request pages include the **Use default values from** field. With this field, you can select predefined settings for the report, which automatically set options and filters. Select an entry from the dropdown list to view the options and filters on the report request page change accordingly.

The entry called **Last used options and filters** is always available. This entry sets the report to use the options and filters you used the last time you ran the report.

The **Use default values from** field provides a fast and reliable way to consistently generate reports with the correct data. After you select an entry, you can change any of the options and filters before you preview or print the report. The changes you make aren't saved to the predefined settings entry you select, but they're saved to the **Last used options and filters** entry.

> [!NOTE]
> The predefined settings are typically set up and managed by an administrator. Learn more in [Manage Saved Settings for Reports and Batch Jobs](reports-saving-reusing-settings.md).

## Specify the data to include in a report

Use the fields under **Options** and **Filters** to change or limit the information you want in the report. You can set filters in a report in more or less the same way as you set filters on lists. Learn more in the [Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#filtering) section.

> [!CAUTION]
> The **Filter** FastTab on a report request page provides a generic filtering capability for reports. These filters are optional.
>
> Some reports ignore any such filters, which means no matter what filter is set in the **Filter** FastTab, the output of the report is the same. It's not possible to provide a list of which fields are ignored in which reports, so you need to experiment with the filters when using them.
>
> **Example**: When you use the **Create Reminders** batch job, a filter for the **Customer Ledger Entries** field of **Last Issued Reminder Level** is ignored because filters are fixed for that batch job.

## Preview a report

By previewing a report, you can review what the report looks like before you print it. The preview isn't based on the printer selected in the **Printer** field on the request page. The browser controls how the preview is displayed. After previewing, you can then go back to the request page and make changes to options and filters as you need.

The preview choices on the **Report Request** page depend on the report. So, for some reports, you can select **Preview**, while for others, the choice is **Preview & Close**. Both choices open a preview of the report. The difference is that **Preview** keeps the request page open, so you can go back to it, make changes, preview again, or print. In contrast, with **Preview & Close** the request page closes, and you have to open the report again to make changes or print.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using Business Central 2020 release wave 1 or earlier, the only choice is **Preview**, which closes the request page on preview, as described for **Preview & Close**.

### Work with the preview

In the preview, use the menu bar on the report preview to:

- Move through pages
- Zoom in and out
- Resize to fit the page
- Select text
  
  You can copy text from a report, then paste it somewhere else, such as a page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or Microsoft Word. Using a mouse, for example, select the left mouse button and hold where you want to start. Slide the mouse to select one or more words, sentences, or paragraphs. Then select the right mouse button and select **Copy**. You can now paste the selected text where you want it.

- Pan the document
  
  You can move the visible area of the report in any direction to view other areas of the report. Panning is helpful when you zoom in to review details. Using your mouse, for example, select and hold the left mouse button anywhere in the report preview, and then move your mouse to select a section of the report.

- Download to a PDF file on your computer or network.
- Print

## Save a report to a file

You can save a report to a PDF document, Microsoft Word document, Microsoft Excel workbook, or XML document by choosing **Send to**, then making your selection. A file is downloaded to your computer.

If your organization configured OneDrive for system features, instead of being downloaded, Excel workbooks and Word documents are opened in your browser using either Excel or Word for the web.

> [!TIP]
> The **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** and **XML Document** options are mostly for advanced purposes. You'd typically use these options to do detailed data analysis. Learn more at [Analyzing report data with Excel and XML](report-analyze-excel.md).
>
> You can also use **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** to create new Excel layouts for a given report. Learn more at [Working with Microsoft Excel layouts](ui-excel-report-layouts.md).  

## <a name="ScheduleReport"></a> Schedule a report to run later or periodically

You can schedule a single or recurring report to run at a specific date and time. Scheduled reports are entered in the job queue and processed at the scheduled time, similar to other jobs. Select the **Schedule** option after selecting **Send to**, then enter information, such as the printer, and time and date. The report is added to the job queue and runs at the specified time. When the report is processed, the item is removed from the job queue. Learn more at [Use job queues to schedule tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

When you schedule a report to run, you can specify, for example, that it must run every Thursday by setting the **Next Run Date Formula** field to *D4*. Learn more in the [Use date formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas) section.  

You can save the report to a file (such as Excel, Word, or PDF), print it, or only generate the report. If you save the report to a file, then the processed report is sent to the **Report Inbox** page on your Role Center for you to view it. Learn more at [Share and export reports with the report inbox](ui-work-report-inbox.md).

### Manage scheduled recurring reports

Batch jobs generate scheduled reports managed on the **Job Queue Entries** page. You can view each report's status and other information on the page, pause/resume the report batch job, and generate the report on demand.

From the **Job Queue Entries** page, you can also change some report parameters, such as the output file type, recurrence, run date, and starting and ending times. Before you edit an existing scheduled report, however, it's necessary to put the report job queue on hold:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do.") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, then select the related link.  
2. On the **Job Queue Entries** page, select the desired report.
3. Select the **Set On Hold** action.
4. Open and edit the scheduled report by selecting its status (*On Hold*).

After you edit the report options, repeat the first two steps and then select the **Set Status to Ready** action to resume generating the report.

Learn more about job queue management at [Use job queues to schedule tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

## <a name="PrintReport"></a>Print a report

To print a report, select **Print** on the report request page or on the menu bar of the **Preview** page.

When a report uses an Excel layout, you don't have the **Printer** field or **Print** or **Preview** buttons. Instead, there's a **Download** option. To print, select **Download**, then open the downloaded file in Excel and print from there.

### <a name="Printer"></a>Printer

The **Printer** field on the request page shows the name of printer the report is sent to. To change a printer, just select the printer from the list.

> [!NOTE]
> The **(Handled by the browser)** option indicates there's no designated printer for the report. In this case, the browser handles the printout and displays the standard printing steps, where you can choose a local printer connected to your computer. The **(Handled by the browser)** option isn't available in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app or app for Microsoft Teams.

> [!TIP]
> The printer selected for you by default is set up on the **Printer Selections** page. Learn more about how you can change the default printer in the [Set up default printers](ui-specify-printer-selection-reports.md#default) section.

### Print reports in Thai

Specifically for the Thai version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the **Print** button can't print reports correctly because of limitations in the service that generates the printable PDF file. Instead, you can open the report in Word and then save the report as a printable PDF.  

Or, you can ask your administrator to create a Word report layout for your most used reports. Learn more at [Report and document layouts overview](ui-manage-report-layouts.md).  

## Switch the report layout

A report layout controls how the content is arranged, the organization of the content and the style of the report. There are a few ways to change the layout:

- When you're setting up to run a report, view the current layout in the **Report Layout** field on the request page. To temporarily switch to a different layout, select the **Report Layout** field, then select from a list of available layouts for the report.
- To change the default layout used by a report, go to either the **Report Layouts** or **Report Layout Selection** pages.

Learn more at [Set the layout used by a report](ui-set-report-layout.md). Or, if you want to customize your own report layout, go to [Get started creating report layouts](ui-get-started-layouts.md).

## Change language and format of numbers, dates, and times

By default, the language of text and format of numbers, dates, and times in a report are based on your working language and region settings, which are defined on the **My Settings** page. You can, however, change the language and format region on a case-by-case basis when you preview, print, or send a report. On the request page, set the **Language** and **Format Region** options to your preference. You can also specify the language and region format to use by default for customers and vendors on their card pages.

Depending on where you specified the language and format settings, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] determines the settings to use in the following order:

1. The settings you specify when you generate a report.
2. The settings specified on the document, which come from the customer or vendor's settings.
3. The settings specified on the Report AL object.
4. The settings defined in My Settings.

For more information about the **My Settings** page, go to [Change basic settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).

## Advanced options

The fields under the **Advanced** FastTab set limitations on the generated report to control printer resources. You typically don't need to change these settings, unless you're working with a large report. If a report exceeds these limitations when you try to preview or print, a message appears indicating which limitations are exceeded. You can then change the settings to suit your report. Each field, however, has a maximum value you should be aware of:

|Field|Maximum value|
|-----|-------------|
|Maximum rendering time|12:00:00|
|Maximum rows|1000000|
|Maximum documents|500|

> [!NOTE]
> The maximum values might be different for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, and an administrator can change them. Learn more in the [Reports settings](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#Reports) section. For an overview of report limitations in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, go to [Operational limits](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/operational-limits-online).

## Get help for a report

Get help using a report in two ways: teaching tips and help pane.

### Teaching tip for a report

Many reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have a teaching tip to increase your chance of success with the report. The title and description of these teaching tips try to answer the following hypothetical questions:

- What is this report about?
- What can I do with this report?

With teaching tips, the report creator helps you understand the logic relevant to the report, allowing you to start your reporting task immediately without being blocked. After you dismiss a teaching tip, you can select or hover over the report title on the request page to reopen the teaching tip.

Learn more in [In-product tips](product-help-and-support.md#in-product-tips)

### Help pane for a report

When the report request page is open, select the **Help** question mark in the top-right corner of the role center to open the help pane. Here, you find the teaching tip text (if defined on the report). You also find relevant links to documentation articles that explain related topics in more depth.

Learn more in [Help pane](product-help-and-support.md#help-pane)

# Frequently asked questions about the Power BI apps in Business Central

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

This article provides answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] licenses do I need?

To use the Power BI apps, you need [!INCLUDE [powerbi-pro-license-name](includes/powerbi-pro-license-name.md)] licenses for the following users:

- Users who install the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template apps.
- Users who refresh the report data.
- Users who access the reports.

Alternatively, you can use [!INCLUDE [powerbi-premium-capacity-name](includes/powerbi-premium-capacity-name.md)].

To learn more, go to [Installing Power BI apps for Business Central (prerequisites)](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#prerequisites).

## Why do I need [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] licenses?

You must have [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] licenses for the following reasons:

1. You must install [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template apps from Microsoft AppSource.
2. You must share a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] workspace.

The use of free license alternative for [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] allows you to embed your own reports. Anything in the free [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] license must be present in your personal [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] workspace. So, the free license alternative does not work with the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps.

## What Business Central licenses do I need?

[!INCLUDE[about_bc_licensing_for_powerbi](includes/about_bc_licensing_for_powerbi.md)]

[!INCLUDE[about_licensing](includes/about_licensing.md)]

## Can I install the same app multiple times for different companies or environments?

Yes. Just choose **Install another copy of the app into a new workspace** when you install the app again. Consider including the company name in the workspace name for easier discoverability.

# Financial Reporting frequently asked questions (FAQ)

This article provides answers to frequently asked questions about the Financial Reporting feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## New report, row, or column definitions aren't available after an upgrade. How do I get access to them?

Financial report, row, and column definitions are stored as data in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database. To make sure your definitions aren't overwritten or changed during upgrade, new definitions are only available in new [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenants.

To make new report, row, or column definitions available in existing companies, follow these steps:

1. Create a new tenant.
1. Export the definitions you would like as configuration packages.
1. Sign in to your tenant, and switch to the company where you want the new definitions.
1. Import the configuration packages with the new definitions.

To learn more, go to [Import or export financial report definitions](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md#import-or-export-financial-report-definitions).

## Why don't the numbers in my report balance with the general ledger?

When you create new financial reports, you might find that they don't balance with the general ledger. To learn more about possible reasons and ways to fix these issues, go to [Balancing reports to the general ledger](bi-troubleshoot-financial-reports.md#balancing-reports-to-the-general-ledger).

## How can I test my report?

One way to quickly identify errors in the design of your financial reporting is to add check figures to your row definitions. To learn more, go to [Adding check figures](bi-troubleshoot-financial-reports.md#adding-check-figures).

## When should I use net change vs. balance at date?

A typical mistake that financial reporting users make is to incorrectly combine row and column definitions. When column definitions use net change as the row type, the columns are most appropriately combined with income statement reports. When column definitions use balance at date as the row type, the columns are most appropriately combined with balance sheet reports. To learn more, go to [When to use net change or balance at date](bi-troubleshoot-financial-reports.md#when-to-use-net-change-or-balance-at-date).

## Which users can run or modify financial reports?

To learn more, go to [Permissions to view or edit financial reports](finance-financial-reporting-auditing.md#permissions-to-view-or-edit-financial-reports).

## How can I setup auditing on changes to financial reports?

To learn more, go to [Set up the Change Log for financial report definitions](finance-financial-reporting-auditing.md#set-up-the-change-log-for-financial-report-definitions).

## How can I get notified when financial report definitions change?

To learn more, go to [Get notified when financial report definitions change](finance-financial-reporting-auditing.md#get-notified-when-financial-report-definitions-change).

## How can I analyze changes to financial reports?

To learn more, go to [Analyze changes to financial report definitions](finance-financial-reporting-auditing.md#analyze-changes-to-financial-report-definitions).

# Use XML Schemas to Prepare Data Exchange Definitions

To enable import/export of data in XML files through the data exchange framework in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can use XML schemas to define which data elements you want to exchange with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You perform this work on the **XML Schema Viewer** page by loading the XML schema file, selecting the relevant data elements, and then initializing a data exchange definition.  

 When you have defined which data elements to include based on the XML schema, you can use the **Generate Data Exchange Definition** action to initialize a data exchange definition based on the selected data elements, which you then complete in the Data Exchange Framework. This creates a record on the **Posting Exchange Definition** page where you continue by defining which elements in the file map to which fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

 This topic contains the following procedures:  

- To load an XML schema file  

- To select or clear nodes in an XML schema  

- To generate a data exchange definition that is based on an XML schema  

## To load an XML schema file

1. Make sure that the relevant XML schema file is available. The file extension is .xsd.  

2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **XML Schemas**, and then choose the related link.  

3. Choose the **New** action.  

4. Fill the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|Specify a code to identify the XML schema.|  
    |**Description**|Specify a description of the XML schema.|  

     The **Target Namespace** field specifies any namespace in the XML schema file that has been loaded for the line.  

5. Choose the **Load Schema** action, and then select the XML schema file.  

     When the file is loaded, the rest of the fields on the line are filled with information from the file, and the **Schema is Loaded** check box is selected.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The tree of the loaded XML schema is collapsed by default. You expand each node by choosing the **+** button on the node. To expand all nodes, choose **Expand All** on the ribbon.  

### To select or clear nodes in an XML schema  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **XML Schema Viewer**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Fill the fields on the header as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**XML Schema Code**|Specify the XML schema file that you loaded in step 5 in the "To load an XML schema file" section.|  
    |**New XMLport No.**|Specify the number of the XMLport that is created from this XML schema when you choose the **Generate XMLport** action.|  

     The lines are now filled with nodes representing all elements in the XML schema. Nodes for elements that are mandatory according to the XML schema are selected by default.  

3. On the first line, in the **Node Name** column, expand the **Document** node, and then gradually expand underlying nodes that you want to review.  

     Alternatively, right-click on a node and then choose **Expand All**.  

4. Choose either of the following actions to change which nodes are displayed.  

    |**Action**|Description|  
    |----------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Show All**|All nodes are shown.|  
    |**Hide Non-Mandatory**|Only nodes representing elements that are required according to the XML schema are shown. These nodes are typically indicated by a **1** in the **MinOccurs** field.<br /><br /> Choose **Show All** to reverse the view.|  
    |**Hide Non-Selected**|Only nodes where the **Selected** check box is selected are shown.<br /><br /> Choose **Show All** to reverse the view.|  

5. Choose the **Edit** action.  

6. In the **Selected** check box, specify for each node if you want the element to be supported in the data exchange definition for the related SEPA bank file.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  When you select a mandatory child node, all parent nodes above it are also selected.  

7. Choose the **Select All Mandatory Elements** action to reselect all nodes that represent elements that are mandatory according to the XML schema.  

8. Choose the **Deselect All** action to clear all selections.  

     The **Choice** field specifies that the node has two or more sibling nodes that function as options.  

### To generate a data exchange definition that is based on an XML schema  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter  **XML Schemas**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Select the relevant XML schema, and then choose the **Open XML Schema Viewer** action.  

3. Make sure the relevant nodes are selected. For more information, see the "To select or clear nodes in an XML schema" section.  

4. On the **XML Schema Viewer** page, choose the **Generate Data Exchange Definition** action.  

 A data exchange definition is created on the **Posting Exchange Definition** page, which you can complete by specifying which elements in the file map to which fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also use the **Get File Structure** function from the **Posting Exchange Definition** page, which uses the functionality of the **XML Schema Viewer** page to prefill the **Column Definitions** TastTab.  

> [!NOTE]
> In 2019 release wave 1 and earlier versions, you could generate an XMLport that was based on the schema and then import that into your solution. This is no longer supported.

# Categorize items

To maintain an overview of your items and to help you sort and find items, it's useful to organize your items in item categories.

To find items by characteristics, you can assign item attributes to items and also to item categories. For more information, see [Work with Item Attributes](inventory-how-work-item-attributes.md).

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=4c02e1d8-7569-4eb4-94cf-105899787978]

## To create an item category
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Categories**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Item Categories** page, choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Item Category Card** page, on the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. On the **Attributes** FastTab, specify any item attributes for the item category. For more information, see [To assign item attributes to item categories](inventory-how-work-item-attributes.md#assign-item-attributes-to-item-categories).

> [!NOTE]  
> If the item category has a parent item category, as indicated by the **Parent Category** field, then any item attributes that are assigned to that parent item category are prefilled on the **Attributes** FastTab.

> [!NOTE]  
> Item attributes that you assign to an item category will automatically apply to the item that the item category is assigned to.

If you change your mind about an item category, you can delete it. However, if the category is assigned to an item, you must remove that assignment beforehand.

## To assign an item category to an item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the item that you want to assign to an item category.
3. Choose the lookup button in the **Item Category Code** field and select an existing item category. Alternatively, choose the **New** action to first create a new item category as explained in [To create an item category](inventory-how-categorize-items.md#to-create-an-item-category).

# Design Details: Item Tracking in the Warehouse
Serial number and lot number handling is primarily a warehouse task and therefore all inbound and outbound warehouse documents have standard functionality for assigning and selecting item tracking numbers.  

However, because the reservation system is based on item ledger entries, warehouse activity documents that register only warehouse entries are not fully supported. Because reservations and item tracking numbers can be handled only at the location level, not at the bin and zone level, the **Item Tracking Lines** page cannot be opened from warehouse activity documents. The same applies to the **Reservation** page.  

After a serial or lot number has been added to an item at a warehouse location, it can be moved and reclassified freely within the warehouse by using an independent item tracking structure that is unrelated to the reservation system. **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields are accessed directly on warehouse document lines. When the serial or lot number later partakes in outbound posting, it is synchronized with the reservation system as a part of ordinary bin adjustment. For more information, see [Design Details: Integration with Inventory](design-details-integration-with-inventory.md).  

However, the reservation system does take warehouse activities into consideration when it calculates availability. For example, items that are allocated to picks, or registered as picked, cannot be reserved. For more information, see [Design Details: Warehouse Availability](design-details-availability-in-the-warehouse.md).

# Mapping the tables and fields to synchronize

The basis of synchronizing data is mapping the tables and fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with tables and columns in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], so they can exchange the data. Mapping happens through integration tables.

## Mapping integration tables

An integration table is a table in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database that represents a table, such as an account, in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Integration tables include fields that correspond to columns in the [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table. For example, the Account integration table connects to the Accounts table in [!INCLUDE[cds_short_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. There must be an integration table mapping for each table in [!INCLUDE[cds_short_md](includes/cds_short_md.md)] that you want to synchronize with data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

When you create the connection between the apps, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] sets up some default mappings. You can change the table mappings if you want. For more information, see [Standard Table Mapping for Synchronization](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#standard-table-mapping-for-synchronization). If you changed the default mappings and want to revert your changes, on the **Integration Table Mappings** page, choose **Use Default Synchronization Setup**.

> [!Note]
> If you are using an on-premises version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the integration table mappings are stored in table 5335 Integration Table Mappings, where you can view and edit the mappings. Complex mappings and synchronization rules are defined in codeunit 5341.

> [!TIP]
> When a coupled record changes, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically synchronizes the data with Dataverse. Automatic synchronization is great in most cases. However, frequent changes to large amounts of coupled records in a table can slow down data synchronization.
>
> To avoid slow performance, on the **Integration Table Mappings** page, you can enable or disable event-based data synchronization for any table. By default, event-based synchronization is turned on so that existing integrations aren’t affected. Your administrator can turn it on or off for specific tables.

### Add table and field mappings to existing integration tables

[!INCLUDE [preview](includes/preview.md)]

On the **Integration Table Mappings** page, you can use the New Table Mapping action to add new table mappings to integration tables. The action starts the **Create new integration mappings** assisted setup guide, which helps you set up new integration table and field mappings.

The guide lets you map the tables in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with existing integration tables in Dataverse. You can also specify the Dataverse table's unique identifier in **Integration Table Unique Identifier Field Name** and the **Integration Table Modified on Field Name**, which are needed for data synchronization to work.

> [!NOTE]
> The lookup on the Table column shows all [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables, including custom tables, that aren't yet mapped. It excludes those that already exist on your Integration Table Mappings page. The lookup on the Integration Table column shows only Dataverse tables (AL Proxy Tables) that are part of out-of-the-box integrations. To add additional or custom Dataverse tables, you'll need help from a developer to create and deploy them through an extension.

The Advanced action opens extra table mapping settings that you can set up. In the **Advanced** section, the **Table Filter** field lets you specify filters for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Use the **Integration Table Filter** field for Dataverse data to consider in data synchronization together with the configuration template codes in **Table Config. Template Code** and **Int. Tbl. Config. Code** to prefill missing data when new data comes from either application.

The guide also helps you specify the fields you want the new mapping to contain. You can match a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] field in the **Field Name** column with a Dataverse field name in the **Integration Field Name** column. You can also specify a **Direction**, whether the field always has the same value in the **Constant** column, and whether validations or transformations need to be applied during field mapping.

> [!NOTE]
> To reduce errors, the lookup for the **Integration Table Field** column filters to a list of available fields. To map fields that the filters don't include, you'll need help from a developer.
>
> * Fields must be enabled.
> * You can't use the guide to map FlowField and FlowFilter fields.
> * You can only map fields of the type BigInteger, Boolean, Code, Date, DateFormula, DateTime, Decimal, Duration, GUID, Integer, Option, and Text.

> [!TIP]
> You can also add new field mappings to existing integration table mappings through the **Integration Field Mappings** list page, which you can access by choosing **Fields** on the **Integration Table Mappings** page.
>
> Simply choose **New Field Mapping** to open the field mapping step of the **Create new integration mappings** assisted setup guide, and then proceed as described in this article.

New field mappings you add to an existing table mapping are in a Disabled state. You can choose **Edit List** to enable them later.

### Synchronization rules

An integration table mapping also includes rules that control how integration synchronization jobs synchronize records in a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and a table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For examples of rules for an integration with Sales, go to [Synchronization Rules](#synchronization-rules).

### Strategies for autoresolving conflicts

Data conflicts can easily occur when business applications exchange data on an ongoing basis. For example, someone might delete or change a row in one of the applications, or both. To reduce the number of conflicts to manually resolve, you can specify resolution strategies. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically resolves conflicts according to the rules in the strategies.

Integration table mappings include rules that control how synchronization jobs synchronize records. On the **Integration Table Mapping** page, in the **Resolve Deletion Conflicts** and **Resolve Update Conflicts** columns, you can specify how [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] resolves conflicts that occur because records were deleted in tables in one or the other business application, or updated in both. 

In the **Resolve Deletion Conflicts** column, you can choose to have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically restore deleted records, remove the coupling between the records, or do nothing. If you do nothing, you must manually resolve conflicts. 

In the **Resolve Update Conflicts** column, you can choose to have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically send a data update to the integration table when sending data to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], or to get a data update from the integration table when getting data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], or do nothing. If you do nothing, you must manually resolve conflicts.

After you specify the strategy, on the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page, you can choose the **Retry All** action to automatically resolve conflicts.

## Mapping integration fields

Mapping tables is only the first step. You must also map the fields on the tables. Integration field mappings link fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables with corresponding columns in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], and determine whether to synchronize data in each table. The standard table mapping that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides includes field mappings, but you can change the mappings. For more information, see [Viewing Table Mappings](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#tip-for-admins-viewing-table-mappings).

> [!Note]
> If you are using an on-premises version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], integration field mappings are defined in table 5336 Integration Field Mapping.

You can manually map the fields, or you can automate the process by mapping multiple fields at the same time based on criteria for matching their values. For more information, see [To couple multiple records based on field value matching](admin-how-to-couple-and-synchronize-records-manually.md).

### Handle differences in field values

Sometimes the values in the fields that you want to map are different. For example, in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] the language code for the United States is "U.S.," but in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] it's "US." That means you must transform the value when you synchronize data. You can specify transformation rules for the fields on the **Integration Table Mappings** page by choosing **Mapping**, and then **Fields**. Predefined rules are provided, but you can also create your own. For more information, see [Transformation Rules](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md#transformation-rules).

### Handle missing option values

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contains option set columns that provide values that you can map to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fields of the type **Option** for automatic synchronization. During synchronization, nonmapped options are ignored and the missing options are appended to the related [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and added to the **CDS Option Mapping** system table to be handled manually later. For example, by adding the missing options in either product and then updating the mapping. For more information, see [Handling Missing Option Values](admin-cds-missing-option-values.md).

## Couple records

Coupling links rows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are typically coupled with customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Coupling records offers the following benefits:

* It makes synchronization possible.
* Users can open records or rows in one business app from the other.

Coupling requires that the apps are already integrated.

Couplings can be set up automatically by using the synchronization jobs, or manually by editing the record in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Synchronizing Data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md) and [Couple and Synchronize Records Manually](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#synchronize-individual-table-mappings).

## Filter records and rows  

If you don't want to synchronize all rows for a specific table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] or table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can set up filters to limit the data that is synchronized. You set up filters on the **Integration Table Mappings** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Integration Table Mappings**, and then choose the related link.
2. To filter the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records, set the **Table Filter** field.  
3. To filter the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] rows, set the **Integration Table Filter** field.  

## Create new records  

By default, only coupled records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and rows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are synchronized by the integration synchronization jobs. You can set up table mappings to create new records or rows in the destination app for each row in the source app that isn't already coupled.  

For example, the SALESPEOPLE - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job uses the table mapping SALESPEOPLE. The synchronization job copies data from users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to salespersons in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you set up the table mapping to create new records, for every user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] that isn't already coupled to a salesperson in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a new salesperson row is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

### To create new records during synchronization  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Integration Table Mappings**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the table mapping entry in the list, clear the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** field.  

## Use configuration templates on table mappings

You can specify one or more configuration templates to use for new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records, and another template to use new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] rows.  

If you install the default synchronization setup, most of the time, two configuration templates are automatically created and used on the table mapping for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] accounts: **CDSCUST** and **CDSACCOUNT**.  

* **CDSCUST** creates and synchronizes new customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on accounts in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].  

     To create this template, copy an existing configuration template for customers. The **CDSCUST** is created only if there's an existing configuration template and the **Currency Code** field in the template is blank. If a field in the configuration template contains a value, the value replaces the value in the mapped column for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account. For example, if the **Country/Region** column in an account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contains *U.S.* and the **Country/Region** field in the configuration template is **GB**, then **GB** is used as the **Country/Region** for the customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

* **CDSACCOUNT** creates and synchronizes new accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] based on an account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

You can add more templates, and use filters to define conditions under which [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] applies them. The templates apply to data moving in either direction. For example, you might use a template for domestic customers in the United States, and another for foreign customers in the European Union, or vice versa. In that case, when the data synchronizes, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the country/region code for the customer to apply the appropriate template.

### To specify configuration templates on a table mapping  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Integration Table Mappings**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the table mapping entry in the list, in the **Table Config Templates** field, choose to the configuration template to use for new records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  
3. If you have multiple templates, to define the conditions that determine when to use the template, enter criteria in the **Integration Table Filter** field, and then enter a number in the **Priority** field. The priority determines the order in which [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] evaluates whether to use the templates.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Table Config Template Code** and **Int. Tbl. Config Template Code** fields show different values depending on the number of templates that you configure for a specific integration table mapping:
   >
   > * If you configure a single configuration template, the name of the configuration template shows in order to stay compatible with current capabilities.
   > * If you configure multiple configuration templates, the number of configured configuration templates shows.

4. Set the **Int. Tbl. Config Template Code** field to the configuration template to use for new records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

# Setting up inventory

Before you can manage warehouse activities and inventory costing, you must configure the rules and values that define the company's inventory policies.

You can provide better customer service and optimize your supply chain by organizing your inventory at different addresses. You can then buy, store, or sell items at different locations and transfer inventory between them.

After you set up your inventory, you can manage various processes related to item transactions. For more information, see [Manage Inventory](inventory-manage-inventory.md) and [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md).

# Set Up Fixed Asset Depreciation

You can use various methods of depreciation for preparing financial statements and income tax returns. Many large corporations use straight-line depreciation in their financial statements because this generally permits reporting higher earnings. For income tax purposes, however, many businesses use an accelerated depreciation method, such as declining-balance depreciation. You define an asset's depreciation method with the **Depreciation Method** field on the **Fixed Asset Card** page. For more information about what the different methods do, see [Depreciation Methods](fa-depreciation-methods.md).

You set up depreciation books where you define the different ways depreciation must be calculated for different types of fixed assets. Each depreciation book specifies individual depreciation terms. For example, you can specify that a fixed asset should be depreciated over a period of three years in one book and over a period of five years in another book.

When you have created the relevant depreciation books, you must assign one or more depreciation books to each fixed asset. A depreciation book that is assigned to a fixed asset is referred to as a fixed asset depreciation book. You can set up an unlimited number of depreciation books for a fixed asset.  

## To create a depreciation book

In a fixed asset depreciation book, you specify how fixed assets are depreciated. To accommodate various methods of depreciation, you can set up multiple depreciation books.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Depreciation Books List** page, choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Depreciation Book Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You can record fixed asset transactions on the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page or on the **Fixed Asset Journal** page, depending on whether the transactions are for financial reporting or for internal management. Follow the next step to define which type of journal is used for the different fixed asset activities by default.
4. On the **Integration** FastTab, select the check box for each fixed asset activity whose transactions you want to post using the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for each depreciation method or posting method that you want to assign to fixed assets as a depreciation book.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Choose the **Use Rounding in Periodic Depr.** field to round the calculated periodic depreciation amounts to whole numbers. For example, if your company also uses invoice rounding to whole numbers in the **General Ledger Setup** page, rounding also depreciation amounts to whole numbers can help provide transparency.

For example, if you dispose of a fixed asset where the depreciation book does not specify rounding, but your company's general ledger setup requires rounding, then, when you dispose of the fixed asset, you will see an error message that an amount must be rounded on a ledger entry.  

## To assign a depreciation book to a fixed asset

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the fixed asset that you want to set up a fixed asset depreciation book for.
3. On the **Depreciation Book** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. If you need to assign more than one depreciation book to the fixed asset, choose the **Add More Depreciation Books** action.
5. Alternatively, choose the **Depreciation Books** action to specify one or more fixed asset depreciation books.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   When you use the manual depreciation method, you must enter depreciation manually in the fixed asset G/L journal. The **Calculate Depreciation** function omits fixed assets that use the manual depreciation method. You can use this method for assets that are not subject to depreciation, such as land.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you use the user-defined depreciation method, you need to assign the depreciation book in a different way. For more information, see [Set Up User-Defined Depreciation Method](fa-how-setup-user-defined-depreciation-method.md).

## To assign a depreciation book to multiple fixed assets with a batch job

If you want to assign a depreciation book to several fixed assets, you can use the **Create FA Depreciation Books** batch job to create fixed asset depreciation books.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the fixed asset that you want to set up a assign a depreciation book to, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **Depreciation Book Card** page, choose the **Create FA Depreciation Books** action.
4. On the **Create FA Depreciation Books** page, fill in the **Depreciation Book** field.
5. Choose the **Copy from FA No.** field, and then select the fixed asset number that you want to use as the basis for creating new fixed asset depreciation books.

    If you fill in this field, the depreciation fields in the new fixed asset depreciation books will contain the same information as the corresponding fields in the fixed asset depreciation book that you copy from. Leave the field blank if you want to create new fixed asset depreciation books with empty depreciation fields.  
6. On the **Fixed Asset** FastTab, you can set a filter to select the assets that you want to create the fixed asset depreciation books for.
7. Choose the **OK** button.

## To set up depreciation posting types

For each depreciation book, you must set up how you want [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to handle various posting types. For example, whether posting should be debit or credit and whether the posting type should be included in the depreciable basis.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the depreciation book that you want to set up, and them choose the **FA Posting Type Setup** action.
3. On the **FA Posting Type Setup** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   You cannot insert or delete lines on the **FA Posting Type Setup** page. You can only modify the existing lines.

We recommend that you do not change the setup for depreciation books for entries that have already been posted. Changes will not affect the entries that are already posted, which would make depreciation book statistics misleading.

## To set up default templates and batches for fixed asset depreciation

For each depreciation book, you define a default setup of templates and batches. You use these defaults to duplicate lines from one journal to another, create journal lines using the **Calculate Depreciation** or **Index Fixed Assets** batch jobs, duplicate acquisition costs in the insurance journal.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the depreciation book that you want to define default journals for, and then choose the **FA Journal Setup** action.  
3. If you want to have a default setup for each user, choose the **User ID** field to select from the **Users** page.  
4. In the other fields, select the journal template or journal batch that must be used by default.  

## Fiscal Year 365 Days Field Depreciation

When the Calculate Depreciation batch job calculates depreciations, the batch job normally uses a standardized year of 360 days where each of the 12 months has 30 days.

If you select this field, the Calculate Depreciation batch job uses the calendar year of 365 days instead, where each month is calculated with the same number of days as in the calendar. The only exception is February in leap years, which the batch job will treat as having 28 days and not 29. Because of that, all years, also leap years, are considered to have 365 days.

# Design details: production order posting

Similar to assembly order posting, the consumed components and the used machine time are converted and output as the produced item when the production order is finished. To learn more, go to [Design Details: Assembly Order Posting](design-details-assembly-order-posting.md). However, the cost flow for assembly orders is less complex because assembly cost posts only one time and doesn't generate work-in-process inventory. Also, the cost of assembled goods doesn't include the cost of noninventory items.

You can track transactions that occur during the manufacturing process through the following stages:  

1. Purchase of materials and other manufacturing inputs.  
2. Conversion into work in process.  
3. Conversion into finished goods inventory.  
4. Sale of finished goods.  

Therefore, apart from regular inventory accounts, a manufacturing company must establish three separate inventory accounts to record transactions at various stages of production. The following table describes the accounts

|Inventory account|Description|  
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Raw Materials account**|Includes the cost of raw materials that are purchased but not yet transferred to production. The balance in the Raw Materials account indicates the cost of raw materials on hand.<br /><br /> When raw materials move into the production department, the cost of the materials is transferred from the account for raw materials to the account for work in process.|  
|**Work in Process (WIP) account**|Accumulates the costs that are incurred during production in the accounting period. The WIP account is debited for the cost of raw materials that transfer from:<br /><br />* The raw materials warehouse.<br />* The cost of direct labor performed.<br />* The manufacturing overhead costs that are incurred.<br /><br />The WIP account is credited for the total manufacturing cost of units that are completed in the factory and transferred to the finished goods warehouse.|  
|**Finished Goods account**|This account includes the total manufacturing cost of units that are completed but not yet sold. At the time of sale, the cost of units sold is transferred from the Finished Goods account to the Cost of Goods Sold account.|  

The inventory value is calculated by tracking the costs of all increases and decreases, as expressed by the following equation:  

* inventory value = beginning balance of inventory + value of all increases - value of all decreases  

Depending on the type of inventory, different transactions can represent increases and decreases.  

||Increases|Decreases|  
|-|---------------|---------------|  
|**Raw material inventory**|-   Net purchases of material<br />-   Output of subassemblies<br />-   Negative consumption|Material consumption|  
|**WIP inventory**|-   Material consumption<br />-   Capacity consumption<br />-   Manufacturing overhead|Output of end items (cost of goods manufactured)|  
|**Finished goods inventory**|Output of end items (cost of goods manufactured)|-   Sales (cost of goods sold)<br />-   Negative output|  

The values of increases and decreases are recorded in the different types of manufactured inventory in the same way as for purchased inventory. Every time an increase or decrease in inventory happens, an item ledger entry and a corresponding general ledger entry are created for the amount. To learn more, go to [Design Details: Inventory Posting](design-details-inventory-posting.md).  

The values of transactions for purchased goods post only as item ledger entries with related value entries. Transactions for produced items post as capacity ledger entries with related value entries in addition to the item ledger entries.  

## Posting structure  

Posting production orders to WIP inventory involves output, consumption, and capacity.  

The following diagram shows the involved posting routines in codeunit 22.  

![Production order posting routines.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_14_production_posting_1.png "Production order posting routines")  

The following diagram shows the associations between the resulting entries and the cost objects.  

![Production entry flow.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_14_production_posting_2.png "Production entry flow")  

The capacity ledger entry describes the capacity consumption in terms of time units, whereas the related value entry describes the value of the specific capacity consumption.  

The item ledger entry describes the material consumption or output in terms of quantities, whereas the related value entry describes the value of this specific material consumption or output.  

A value entry that describes WIP inventory value can be associated with one of the following combinations of cost objects:  

- A production order line, a work or machine center, and a capacity ledger entry.  
- A production order line, an item, and an item ledger entry.  
- Only a production order line  

For more information about how costs from production and assembly are posted to the general ledger, see [Design Details: Inventory Posting](design-details-inventory-posting.md).  

## Capacity posting

Posting output from the last production order routing line results in a capacity ledger entry for the end item, in addition to its inventory increase.  

The capacity ledger entry is a record of the time that was spent to produce the item. The related value entry describes the increase of the WIP inventory value, which is the value of the conversion cost. To learn more, go to [From the Capacity Ledger](design-details-accounts-in-the-general-ledger.md#from-the-capacity-ledger).

## Production order costing  

To control inventory and production costs, a manufacturing company must measure the cost of production orders because the predetermined standard cost of each produced item is capitalized in the balance sheet. To learn more about why produced items use the Standard costing method, go to [Design Details: Costing Methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> In environments that don't use the Standard costing method, the actual rather than the standard cost of produced items is capitalized on the balance sheet.  

The actual cost of a production order consists of the following cost components:  

- Actual material cost or material non-inventory cost  
- Actual capacity cost or subcontractor cost  
- Manufacturing overhead  

These actual costs are posted to the production order and compared to the standard cost to calculate variances. Variances are calculated for each of the item cost components: raw materials, capacity, subcontractor, capacity overhead, and manufacturing overhead. The variances can be analyzed to determine problems, such as excessive waste in processing.  

In standard-cost environments, the costing of a production order is based on the following mechanism:  

1. When the last routing operation is posted, the production order cost is posted to the item ledger and set to the expected cost.  

    This cost equals the output quantity that is posted in the output journal multiplied by the standard cost that is copied from the item card. The cost is treated as expected cost until the production order is finished. To learn more, go to [Design Details: Expected Cost Posting](design-details-expected-cost-posting.md).  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This way of posting differs from assembly order posting, which always posts actual costs. To learn more, go to [Design Details: Assembly Order Posting](design-details-assembly-order-posting.md).  
2. When the production order is set to **Finished**, you invoice the order by running the **Adjust Cost-Item Entries** batch job. As a result, the total cost of the order is calculated based on the standard cost of the consumed materials and capacity. The variances between the calculated standard costs and the actual production costs are calculated and posted.

# FAQ for bank account reconciliation assist with Copilot

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Microsoft Copilot assistance with bank account reconciliation in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What is bank reconciliation assist?

Bank reconciliation is a common accounting task where organizations review their bank account statements to identify transactions that should be registered in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this task is used to identify periodic bank fees or small employee expenses.

Bank reconciliation is typically a multi-step process. First, bank statements are imported into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Next, transactions are matched with ledger entries. Finally, new ledger entries are posted to reflect any residual transactions that weren't previously known to your ledgers.

Copilot in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reduces the manual effort by matching more transactions and suggesting general ledger (G/L) accounts that you can post to.

## What are the capabilities of bank reconciliation assist?

Copilot provides AI-powered assistance with two distinct tasks:

- Improved matching of transactions with ledger entries

    [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers automated rules that automatically match many bank transactions with ledger entries. However, these rules are inflexible and often result in many unmatched transactions, each of which requires manual inspection and comparison. Copilot uses AI technology to inspect those unmatched transactions and identify more matches, based on the dates, amounts, and descriptions. For example, if a customer paid multiple invoices in one lump sum, Copilot reconciles the single bank statement line with the multiple invoice ledger entries.

- Suggested G/L accounts

    For residual bank transactions that can't be matched to any ledger entries, Copilot uses AI technology to compare the transaction description with G/L account names and then suggest the most likely G/L account to post to. For example, if unmatched transactions have the narrative *Fuel Stop 24*, Copilot might suggest that you post them to the *Transportation* account.

Copilot doesn't connect to your bank to retrieve or send transactions. This task remains fully within your control. It's a prerequisite for using Copilot's assistance, regardless of whether the transactions are added to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by using a digital bank connection, imported from a bank statement file, or manually entered.

## What is the intended use of bank reconciliation assist?

Bank account reconciliation assist is designed to improve the accuracy of ledgers by helping customers identify new transactions that they should account for in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. It isn't intended for fraud detection or to identify whether customers paid on time.

## How was bank reconciliation assist evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

Bank account reconciliation assist was tested by using combinations of synthetic bank transaction data and similar G/L accounts and ledger entries that cover the typical variations and data limits for each field and in different languages. Test data represents both typical usage and usage by bad actors. Performance was measured in comparison to manual reconciliation of the same data.

## What are the limitations of bank reconciliation assist? How can users minimize the impact of these limitations when they use the system?

Bank account reconciliation assist performs best when G/L account names, ledger entry descriptions, and bank transaction descriptions are all in the same language. Mixed languages or mixed languages for transaction descriptions often result in fewer matches and suggestions.

Suggested ledger accounts performs best in one of the supported languages (see the next section for a list of languages). Users might experience fewer transaction matches and fewer suggested ledger accounts in other languages.

## In which geographies and languages is bank reconciliation assist available? 

[!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability.md)]

## What is expected of system users when they operate bank account reconciliation assist?

### During bank account reconciliation

AI-powered matches and suggestions might sometimes be incorrect or incomplete. Users of bank account reconciliation assist must review the accuracy of the matches and suggestions that Copilot provides before they choose to keep them. Copilot's matches and suggestions aren't saved to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database until you select the **Keep it** button and close the Copilot window. You can edit and correct any matches or suggestions before you choose to keep them.

### After bank account reconciliation is completed

We recommend that users also verify accuracy and correct any discrepancies after they close the Copilot window. This process should include the following activities:

- Review the reconciliation test report.
- Ensure that your organization has the appropriate review and audit processes in place.
- Reopen any posted reconciliations by using the **Undo** function.
- Correct any erroneous ledger entries through reverse posting of entries.

## What is expected of administrators and system users when they operate bank account reconciliation assist?

System users, such as accountants, treasurers, or other people who work on business accounting, should always review the accuracy of matches and suggestions that Copilot provides before they choose to keep them. After reconciliation with Copilot, we recommend that these users review the reconciliation test report to verify accuracy and identify any discrepancies.

Administrators should ensure that the appropriate accounting users are granted access to this capability.

## Is Copilot the only means of completing bank account reconciliation?

No. Use of Copilot is optional. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers traditional, non-AI-powered means of importing bank statements, running predefined matching rules, and manually applying matches and posting to appropriate ledger accounts. Both the traditional approach and Copilot can be used simultaneously in an organization.

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?

Each time that Copilot provides matches or suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window by using the like (thumbs up) and dislike (thumbs down) controls. Your feedback remains anonymous, and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

# Terminology in cost accounting

This article defines the key terms that are used in cost accounting.  

## Key terms

 The following table shows definitions of the key terms in cost accounting.  

|**Term**|**Definition**|  
|--------------|--------------------|  
|Allocation key|The allocation key is the basis that is used to allocate costs. It's typically a quantity, such as square meters occupied, number of employees, or work hours used. For example, two departments, with 20 and 10 employees respectively, share canteen costs. The costs are distributed between the departments by using an allocation key that represents the number of employees. Two thirds of the costs are allocated to the first department, and one third of the costs are allocated to the second department.|  
|Allocation source|The allocation source establishes which costs are allocated. Allocations are defined in allocation source and allocation target tables. Each allocation consists of an allocation source and one or more allocation targets. For example, all costs for the heating cost type, which is an allocation source, can be allocated to the workshop, production, and sales cost centers, which are three allocation targets.|  
|Allocation target|The allocation targets determine where the costs are allocated. Allocations are defined in allocation source and allocation target tables. Each allocation consists of an allocation source and one or more allocation targets. For example, all costs for the heating cost type, which is an allocation source, can be allocated to the workshop, production, and sales cost centers, which are three allocation targets.|  
|Cost accounting|In cost accounting, actual costs of operations, processes, departments, or products are recorded. These costs are allocated to cost centers and cost objects by using different cost allocation methods. Managers use statistics and reports, such as cost distribution sheet and profit and loss analysis to make decisions and reduce costs. Cost accounting retrieves data from the general ledger, but works independently. Therefore transactions posted in cost accounting don't affect the data in the general ledger.|  
|Cost type|The chart of cost types has the same function as the chart of accounts in the general ledger. They're often structured similarly. Therefore it's possible to transfer the general ledger chart of accounts to the chart of cost types and then modify it. The chart of cost types can also be created from scratch.|  
|Cost center|Cost centers are most often departments and profit centers that are largely responsible for company’s costs and income. Cost centers can be synchronized with dimensions in the general ledger. It's also possible to add new cost centers and define their own sorting with subtotals.|  
|Cost object|Cost objects are products, product groups or services of a company, the finished goods of a company, that in the end carries the costs. Cost objects can be synchronized with dimensions in the general ledger. It's also possible to add new cost objects and define their own sorting with subtotals.|  
|Cost allocation|Cost allocation is a process of allocating costs to cost centers or cost objects. For example, the wage of the truck driver of the sales department is allocated to the sales department cost center. It isn't necessary to allocate the wage cost to other cost centers. Another example is that the cost of an expensive computer system is allocated to the products of the company that use the system.|  
|Dynamic allocation|Dynamic allocations are dependent on changeable allocation bases, for example, the number of department employees, or the sales revenue of the project within a certain period of time. There are nine predefined dynamic allocation bases that users can define by using five filters.|  
|Direct cost|Direct costs are the costs that can be directly allocated to a cost object, for example, material purchase for a specific product.|  
|Fixed cost|Fixed costs are the costs that aren't dependent on the level of goods or services produced by the company. They tend to be time-related, such as salary or rent being paid per month. They are in contrast to variable costs, which are volume-related, and are paid per quantity produced.|  
|Indirect cost|Indirect costs aren't directly accountable to a cost object, such as a particular function or product. Indirect costs may be either fixed or variable. Indirect costs can be tax, administration, personnel, and security costs and are also known as overhead costs.|  
|Level|Level is used to define allocation order. Level is defined as a number between 1 and 99. The allocation posting follows the order of the levels. For example, level ensures that first administration is allocated to workshop before workshop is allocated to vehicle and production.|  
|Static allocation|Static allocations are based on a fixed set of values, for example, the square meters used, or an established allocation ratio, such as 5:2:4.|  
|Operational cost|Operational costs are the recurring expenses, which are related to the operation of a business, a device, and a component.|  
|Overhead cost|Overhead costs refer to ongoing expenses of operating a business. They're all costs on the income statement except for direct labor, direct materials, and direct expenses. Overhead costs include accounting fees, advertising, depreciation, insurance, interest, legal fees, rent, repairs, supplies, taxes, telephone bills, travel, and utilities costs.|  
|Step variable cost|Step variable costs are costs that change dramatically at certain points because they involve large purchases that can't be spread out over time. For example, one employee can produce 100 tables in a month. The employee’s wage is constant over a production range of 1 to 100 tables. If the company wants to produce 110 tables, the company needs two employees. So the cost will double.|  
|Share|The portion or part that is allocated among cost centers or cost objects.|  
|Static weighting|Costs are allocated according to allocation keys, which can be modified by using a multiplier. <br />For example, two departments, with 20 and 10 employees respectively, share canteen costs. The costs are distributed between the departments by using an allocation key that represents the number of employees that eat in the canteen. In the first department, only five employees eat in the canteen, so this department has a multiplier of 0.25. The basis for allocation is 20 x 0.25 = 5. The total number of employees that eat in the canteen is 15. One third of the costs are allocated to the first department and two thirds of the costs are allocated to the second department.|  
|Variable cost|Variable costs are expenses that change in proportion to the activity of a business. Variable costs are the sum of marginal costs over all units produced. Fixed costs and variable costs make up the two components of total costs.|  
|Variant|A variant is used as an optional user-defined label for allocations. The purpose of the label is to filter groups of allocation.|

# Use pre-closing reports

There are many standard reports that you can use to verify the accuracy of the accounts before closing the books at the end of a year or period. For example, you can use the **Customer - Trial Balance** report to verify that the balance for a customer posting group is equal to the balance on the corresponding general ledger account on a certain date.

The following table describes a number of reports that might be useful in this process.

| To | See this report |
| --- | --- |
| Print a detailed trial balance report for one or more bank accounts with additional information about individual entries. |Bank Acc. - Detail Trial Bal. |
| Print a detail trial balance for selected customers. |Customer - Trial Balance |
| Print a detail trial balance with detailed information about individual entries, for selected customers during a selected period. |Customer - Detail Trial Bal. |
| Print a detail trial balance for selected vendors. |Vendor - Trial Balance |
| Print a detail trial balance with detailed information about individual entries, for selected vendors during a selected period. |Vendor - Detail Trial Balance |
| Print a trial balance with the current year's and the previous year's figures. | Closing Trial Balance |
| Print a detailed trial balance report for general ledger account balances. |Detail Trial Balance |
| Print a trial balance report with balances and net changes for general ledger accounts. |Trial Balance |
| Print a trial balance for a consolidated company. |Consolidated Trial Balance |

To see a report, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, type the name as it appears in the table, and then choose the related link.

# Ad-hoc analysis of fixed assets data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze fixed assets data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Total assets," "Depreciations over time," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages to start doing ad-hoc analysis of fixed assets processes:

- [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis)
- [General Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=20&layout=analysis)

<!-- TODO: add examples for 

insurance coverage ledger entries

-->

## Fixed assets ad-hoc analysis scenarios

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of fixed assets scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [Fixed Assets (Current value)](#example-fixed-assets-current-value) | Track asset value, both across all assets and on a single asset. | [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) | **Depreciation Book**, **FA No.**, **FA Posting Date**, **FA Posting Type**, and **Amount** |
| [Asset value changes over time](#example-asset-value-changes-over-time) | Track asset value changes over time. | [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) | **FA Posting Type**, **FA Posting Date**, and **Amount** |
|[Fixed asset depreciations over time](#example-fixed-asset-depreciations-over-time) | Track depreciations over time, both across all assets and on a single asset. | [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) | **Depreciation Book**, **FA No.**, **FA Posting Year**, **FA Posting Month**, **Amount**, and **FA Posting Type** |

### Example: fixed assets current value

To track the value of one or more fixed assets, follow these steps:

## Using the Fixed Assets Ad-hoc Analysis query

You can use the [Fixed Assets Ad-hoc Analysis](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?query=123) query to analyze fixed asset ledger entries. The query adds additional information to the ledger entries, such as the fixed asset class, subclass, location, and depreciation book.

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on fixed assets

When you post fixed asset journals, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates entries in the **FA Entry** table. Therefore, ad-hoc analysis on fixed assets is typically done on the [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604) page.

You might also want to use the [Fixed Assets Ad-hoc Analysis](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?query=123) query.

# Transfer, split, or combine fixed assets

You can reclassify a fixed asset to transfer it to a different department, split it up, or combine it with other fixed assets. These registrations are done using the fixed asset reclassification journal.

To explore the results of fixed asset reclassifications, use the [Fixed Asset Book Value 02](reports/report-5606.md) report.

## To transfer a fixed asset to a different department

You might need to transfer a fixed asset to a different department. For example, when you put an asset in the production department for assembly and then move it to the administration department afterward.  

1. Set up a new fixed asset. Enter the new department as a dimension.  
2. Assign a fixed asset depreciation book to the new fixed asset. For more information, see [Acquire Fixed Assets](fa-how-acquire.md).
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Reclassification Journals**, and then choose the related link.
4. Create a journal line where the **FA No.** field contains the original fixed asset, and the **New FA No.** field contains the new fixed asset to be moved. Fill in the other fields as appropriate.  
5. Choose the **Reclassify** action.

    Two lines are now created in the fixed asset G/L journal using the template and batch that you specify on the **FA Journal Setup** page for the depreciation book. For more information, see [Set Up Fixed Asset Depreciation](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md).
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.    
7. On the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page, choose the **Post** action to post the reclassification that you performed in steps 4 and 5.

If you posted an acquisition cost for an asset, you can use the fixed asset reclassification journal to split the acquisition cost among several assets.  

## To split a fixed asset into three fixed assets

You can split one fixed asset into multiple fixed assets. For example, when you need to distribute a fixed asset across three departments. In that case, you might move 25 percent of the acquisition cost and depreciation for the original fixed asset to the second fixed asset, and 45 percent to the third asset. The remaining 30 percent remains on the original fixed asset.

1. Set up two new fixed assets. Enter the relevant departments as dimensions.  
2. Assign fixed asset depreciation books to the new fixed assets. For more information, see [Acquire Fixed Assets](fa-how-acquire.md).
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Reclassification Journals**, and then choose the related link.
4. Create two reclassification journal lines, one for each new fixed asset.
5. On the first line, enter the second fixed asset in the **New FA No.** field and **25** in the **Reclassify Acq. Cost %** field.
6. On the second line, enter the third fixed asset in the **New FA No.** field and **40** in the **Reclassify Acq. Cost %** field.
7. On both lines, select the **Reclassify Acquisition Cost** and **Reclassify Depreciation** checkboxes.  
8. Choose the **Reclassify** action.  

    Two lines are now created in the fixed asset G/L journal using the template and batch that you specified on the **FA Journal Setup** page for the specified depreciation book. For more information, see [Set Up Fixed Asset Depreciation](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md).    
9. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.
10. On the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page, choose the **Post** action to post the reclassification that you performed in steps 4 through 8.


## To combine two fixed assets into one

You can combine multiple fixed assets into one fixed asset, for example when you move distributed fixed assets into one department. If you posted acquisition costs and depreciation for the fixed asset to move, those values are combined in the single fixed asset.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Reclassification Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a reclassification journal where the **FA No.** field contains the fixed asset to move or combine, and the **New FA No.** field contains the combined fixed asset.
3. Leave the **Reclassify Acq. Cost %** field empty to move/combine the entire acquisition cost.  
4. Select the **Reclassify Acquisition Cost** and **Reclassify Depreciation** checkboxes.
5. Choose the **Reclassify** action.

    Two lines are now created in the fixed asset G/L journal using the template and batch that you specified on the **Fixed Asset Journal Setup** page for the specified depreciation book. For more information, see [Set Up Fixed Asset Depreciation](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md).  
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.
7. On the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page, choose the **Post** action to post the reclassification that you performed in steps 2 through 5.

## To view changed depreciation book values due to fixed asset reclassification

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Book Value 02**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **Print** or **Preview** button.  

For more information, see [Fixed Asset Book Value 02 (report)](reports/report-5606.md).

# Insure fixed assets

Use the **Insurance Card** page to set up an insurance policy to cover one or more fixed assets. You can assign one fixed asset to one insurance policy, or multiple fixed assets to one insurance policy.

You assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy by posting to the insurance coverage ledger from the **Insurance Journal** page.

In addition, you can assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy and create coverage ledger entries when you post its acquisition cost. You post an acquisition cost from the fixed asset journal with the **Insurance No.** field filled in. You must turn on the **Automatic Insurance Posting** toggle on the **Fixed Asset Setup** page. For more information, see [Acquire a fixed asset by using a fixed asset G/L journal](fa-how-acquire.md#acquire-a-fixed-asset-by-using-a-fixed-asset-gl-journal).

If the **Automatic Insurance Posting** toggle on the **Fixed Asset Setup** page isn't turned on, posting acquisitions from the fixed asset journal creates lines on the **Insurance Journal** page. You must post those lines manually.

> [!WARNING]  
> If you don't turn on the **Automatic Insurance Posting** toggle on the **Fixed Asset Setup** page, your insurance journal should be based on a journal template without a number series. This is because the inserted document numbers from the fixed asset journal line will otherwise conflict with the number series of the insurance journal. For more information about journal templates and batches, see [Set Up General Fixed Assets Information](fa-how-setup-general.md).

After you assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy, the **Insured** field on the fixed asset card contains **Yes**. When you sell the fixed asset, the toggle is automatically turned off.

## To create or modify an insurance card

When you receive information about changes in the coverage amount, you must enter the new information on the **Insurance Card** page to ensure that you analyze insurance policy coverage correctly.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new card for an insurance policy. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Alternatively, select the insurance policy that you want to change, and then choose the **Edit** action.

## To assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy by posting from the insurance journal

You assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy by posting to the insurance coverage ledger.  

The following procedure explains how to create an insurance journal line manually. If the **Automatic Insurance Posting** toggle is turned on the **Fixed Asset Setup** page, insurance journal lines are automatically created when you post acquisition costs. In that case, all you have to do is to post the journal.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant journal, and fill in the journal lines as necessary.  
3. To assign multiple fixed assets to one insurance policy, create journal lines with the same value in the **Insurance No.** field and different values in the **FA No.** field.  
4. Choose the **Post** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The entries from an insurance journal are only posted to the insurance coverage ledger.  

## To update the insurance value of a fixed asset

You can use the **Index Insurance** batch job to update the value of the fixed assets that are covered.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Index Insurance**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   In the **Index Figure** field, you enter a decrease of 5%, for example, as 95, whereas you enter an increase of 2% as 102.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

   The batch job calculates the new amount as a percentage of the total value insured, as stated on the **Insurance Statistics** page, and then creates a line in the insurance journal.  
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Open the relevant insurance journal, review the created values, and then post them to the insurance coverage ledger.  

## To monitor insurance coverage

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides dedicated reports and statistics pages for use in analyzing insurance policies and whether your fixed assets are over- or under-insured.  

To learn more about the built-in reports for fixed assets insurance, go to [Fixed assets insurance reports](fa-reports.md#fixed-assets-insurance-reports).

### Overview of insurance policies

To get an overview of your insurance policies, use the [Insurance - List](reports/report-5621.md) report.

### Insurance coverage

To find out which insurance policies cover each asset, and by which amount, use the [Insurance - Tot. Value Insured](reports/report-5625.md) report.

#### Over/under coverage

You can check whether fixed assets are over- or under-insured in the following ways:  

* The **Insurance Statistics** page. A positive amount in the **Over/Under Insured** field means that the fixed asset is over-insured. A negative amount means that the asset is under-insured.  
* The **Fixed Asset Statistics** page. Choose the **Total Value Insured** field to view the **Ins. Coverage Ledger Entries** page.  
* The **Over/Under Coverage** report.  
* The [Insurance - Analysis](reports/report-5620.md) report.  


### Uninsured fixed assets

To check whether you forgot to assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy, use the [Insurance - Uninsured FAs](reports/report-5626.md) report. 


## To view insurance coverage ledger entries

You can view the entries that you made in the insurance coverage ledger.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant insurance policy, and then choose the **Coverage Ledger Entries** action.  


## To view the total insurance value of fixed assets

A matrix page shows the insurance values that are registered for each insurance policy for each fixed asset that result from posted insurance-related amounts.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant insurance policy, and then choose the **Total Value Insures per FA** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **Show Matrix** action.  
5. To see the underlying insurance coverage ledger entries, choose a value in the matrix.  

## To correct insurance coverage entries

If a fixed asset was assigned to the wrong insurance policy, you can correct it by creating two reclassification entries from the insurance journal.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create one journal line for the fixed asset and the correct insurance policy where the value in the **Amount** field is positive.  
3. Create another journal line for the fixed asset and the incorrect insurance policy where the value in the **Amount** field is negative.  
4. Choose the **Post** action.  

The fixed asset is removed from the incorrect insurance policy on the second line. The asset is assigned to the correct insurance policy on the first line of the journal.

   These data sources represent all APIs and web services that are published for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], grouped by environments and companies. With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, **Navigator** has the following structure:

    - **Environment name**
      - **Company name**
        - **Advanced APIs**

          This folder lists advanced APIs published by Microsoft, like the [Business Central automation APIs](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/itpro-introduction-to-automation-apis) and APIs published by other organizations (these APIs are called Custom APIs). Custom APIs are further grouped in folders according to the [APIPublisher](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-apipublisher-property)/[APIGroup](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-apigroup-property) properties of the API source code.

        - **Standard APIs v2.0**

          This folder lists the data APIs exposed in the [Business Central API V2.0](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/). You use these APIs to read data from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database, such as master data (customer, vendor, item, and so on), transactions (general ledger entries, customer entries, and so on), or setup data (dimensions, payment methods, unit of measure, and so on).

        - **Web services \(legacy)**

          This folder lists pages, codeunits, and queries that are published as web services in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Using this legacy method to read data from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is discouraged. We suggest using APIs instead.

    <!--
    > [!NOTE]
    > The structure for Business Central on-premises is different because it doesn't support API pages.-->

7. Select the data source or sources that you want to add to your data model, and then select the **Load** button.
8. If later you want to add more Business Central data, you can repeat the previous steps.

Once the data is loaded, you can see it in the right navigation on the page. At this point, you're connected to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data, and you can begin building your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] report.

## Creating accessible reports

It's important to make your reports usable for as many people as possible. Try to design reports so that they don't require any special adaptation to meet the specific needs of different users. Make sure the design lets users take advantage of assistive technologies, like screen readers. [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] includes various accessibility features, tools, and guidelines to help. To learn more, go to [Design Power BI reports for accessibility](/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-accessibility-creating-reports) in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] documentation.

## Creating reports to display data associated with a list in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

You can create reports that display in a FactBox on a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] list page, and change when different rows are selected in the list. Creating these reports is similar to other reports, except there are a few things to do to make sure the reports display as expected. To learn more, go to [Creating Power BI Reports for Displaying List Data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](across-how-use-powerbi-reports-factbox.md).

## <a name="theme"></a>Using the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report theme (optional)

Before building your report, we recommend that you download and import the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] theme file. The theme file creates a color palette so you can build reports with the same color styling as the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] apps, without requiring you to define custom colors for each visual.

> [!NOTE]
> This task is optional. You can always create your reports and then download and apply the style template later.

### Download the theme

The theme file is available as a json file on Microsoft Power BI Community Themes Gallery. To download the theme file, do the following steps:

1. Go to [Microsoft Power BI Community Themes Gallery for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Themes-Gallery/Microsoft-Dynamics-365-Business-Central/m-p/385875).
2. Select the download attachment **Microsoft Dynamics Business Central.json**.

### Import the theme on a report

After you download the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report theme, you can import it to your reports. To import the theme, Select the **View** > **Themes** > **Browse for themes**. Learn more in [Power BI Desktop - Import custom report themes](/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-report-themes#import-custom-report-theme-files).

## Publish reports

After you create or modify a report, you can publish the report to your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] and also share it with others in your organization. After you publish a report, it's available in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The report also becomes available for selection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

To publish a report, select **Publish** on the **Home** tab of the ribbon or from the **File** menu. If you're signed into the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)], the report is published to this service. Otherwise, you're prompted to sign in. 

## Distribute or share a report

There are a couple of ways to share reports:

- Share a report from your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] (recommended)

    If you have a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-pro-license-name](includes/powerbi-pro-license-name.md)] license or use [!INCLUDE [powerbi-premium-capacity-name](includes/powerbi-premium-capacity-name.md)], you can share the report directly from your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. To learn more, go to [Power BI - Share a dashboard or report](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards#share-a-dashboard-or-report).

- Distribute reports as .pbix files.

    Reports are stored on your computer as .pbix files. You can distribute the .pbix file to users, like any other file. Then, the people you shared the file with can upload it to their [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. To learn more, go to [Upload reports from files](across-working-with-powerbi.md#upload).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Distributing reports in this way means that refreshing data for reports is done individually by each user. This situation might impact [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] performance.

## How to develop cross-company or cross-environment [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports

The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] API endpoints all have the prefix `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/<environment_name>/api/v2.0` followed by `/companies({company_id})/accounts({id})` (here we use the `accounts` API as an illustration). You can use this structure to create PowerQuery queries that load data for multiple companies or multiple environments if the user who is reading data can access them.

To set up a query to load data for multiple companies, follow these steps:

1. Take the PowerQuery query that loads data for a single company. Convert it to a custom Power Query function that takes the company ID (or maybe the environment name) as parameters. To learn more, go to [Using custom Power Query functions](/power-query/custom-function).
1. Now use the new custom function in a PowerQuery query, where you map the function over a list of companies and then merge the datasets using the [Table.Combine](/powerquery-m/table-combine) Power Query function.

## Customize the Power Query code that connects to your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data source

In most cases, using the navigation experience in the Power BI Desktop user interface is enough to get you started with building reports based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data. However, more complex scenario might require you to manually edit the Power Query code responsible to get your data.

To do that, follow these steps:

1. Start [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)].
2. Complete the step that suits your scenario:

   # [Edit existing report](#tab/existing)

   1. Select **File** > **Open**.
   1. Browse for and select the report (.pbix). 
   1. In the ribbon, select **Transform Data** to open the **Power Query Editor**.

   # [Create new report](#tab/new)

   1. In the ribbon, select **Get Data**. If you don't see **Get Data**, select the **File** menu, then **Get Data**.
   1. On the **Get Data** page, select **Online Services** > **Dynamics 365 Business Central** > **Connect**.
   1. In the **Navigator** window, select the API endpoint that you want to load data from.
   1. Select **Transform Data** instead of **Load** as you might normally do. This step opens **Power Query Editor**.

   ---

3. In **Power Query Editor**, select **Advanced Editor** from the ribbon.

This will display the Power Query code that the system autogenerated when you made your selections in the navigator. For example, let's assume you selected the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment named **Production**, the company called **CRONUS USA, Inc.**, the API folder called **Standard APIs v2.0**, and the table called **customers**. Navigating to the Advanced Editor would show a query similar to this one:

```powerquery
let
  Source = Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions(null, null, null, null),
  PRODUCTION = Source{[Name="PRODUCTION"]}[Data],
  #"CRONUS USA, Inc." = PRODUCTION{[Name="CRONUS USA, Inc."]}[Data],
  v2.0 = #"CRONUS USA, Inc."{[Name="v2.0"]}[Data],
  customers_table = v2.0{[Name="customers",Signature="table"]}[Data]
in
  customers_table
```

You can now manually edit this query to make the changes that suite your needs.

### The function `Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions`

In the query above, the function `Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions` is responsible for connecting to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and retrieve the data. This function has 4 optional parameters, that aren't provided in the default query.

Here's a break down of the different parameters:

|Parameter|Examples|Description|
|-|-|-|
|Environment|`"Production"`|This parameter allows you to specify the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment to connect to. If not specified, the function returns a list of all environments, and you need to select the appropriate environment in the subsequent steps of your Power Query code|
|Company|`"CRONUS USA, Inc."`|This parameter allows you to specify the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company to connect to, inside your selected environment. This parameter is ignored if the **Environment** parameter isn't specified. If not specified, the function returns a list of all companies in your selected environent (or environments), and you need to select the appropriate company in the subsequent steps of your Power Query code|
|API category (or API route)|`"microsoft/runtime/beta"`, `"v2.0"`|This parameter allows you to specify the API route connect to in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], inside your selected environment and company. This parameter is ignored if the **Environment** and **Company** parameters aren't specified. If not specified, the function returns a list of all API categories (also called API routes) in your selected environment/environments and company/companies, and you need to select the appropriate API category in the subsequent steps of your Power Query code|
|Advanced Options||This parameter allows you to specify some advanced options to connect to your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data source. Notice that in the vast majority of cases, the default values are optimized and don't need to be changed. For more information about these parameters, consult the following section.|

For example, the query shown above in this section is completely equivalent to the following query:

   ```powerquery
    let
      Source = Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions("PRODUCTION", "CRONUS USA, Inc.", "v2.0", null),
      customers_table = Source{[Name="customers",Signature="table"]}[Data]
    in
      customers_table
  ```

### Advanced: Customize language, timeout, database replica, or page size for your Business Central data source

The [!INCLUDE [powerbi-connector-name](includes/powerbi-connector-name.md)] supports several advanced properties for connecting to a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data source that you can set in your Power Query queries. The following table describes the parameters.

|Advanced Option|Description|Default|Learn more at|
|-|-|-|-|
|AcceptLanguage|This parameter allows you to specify preferred languages for responses, ensuring users receive messages and translatable strings in their desired language. It sets the language in which the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] API session runs. It influences the language of error messages, formatted values in AL, and other values that depend on language or culture.<br><br>Setting this parameter improves user satisfaction and makes the data more accessible and relevant.|*not specified*|[Use locale values in multiple-language Power BI reports](/power-bi/guidance/multiple-language-locale#load-a-report-in-power-bi).|
|ODataMaxPageSize|This parameter limits the number of entities per results page, which allows for more flexibility when connecting to large datasets or using complex queries. It sets the maximum number of records to return for each page when calling an API. For example, if your table **Customers** has 13,000 records and ODataMaxPageSize is set to 5000, Power BI makes 3 API calls to get your customers. The first call gets 5,000 records, the next one gets 5000 more, and the last call gets the remaining 3000. This option can't be higher than the maximum page size enforced by Business Central, which is 20000.<br><br>Setting this parameter ensures efficient and responsive data retrieval, leading to faster insights and decision-making. You can't exceed the maximum page size defined on the service.|5000|[ODataPreferenceHeader.MaxPageSize Property](/dotnet/api/microsoft.odata.odatapreferenceheader.maxpagesize)|
|Timeout|This parameter defines the maximum duration for a request before cancellation. It sets the timeout for each single API call to Business Central. Its value can't exceed the timeout enforced on the Business Central service, which is currentæy 10 minutes (00:10:00).<br><br>Setting this parameter helps manage system resources effectively and prevents long-running queries from impacting overall system performance. Users experience minimal delays and interruptions, ensuring a smoother workflow. |00:08:00|[OData.Feed](/powerquery-m/odata-feed)|
|UseReadOnlyReplica|This parameter determines whether requests target the primary database or a read-only replica. Offloading read operations from the primary database can significantly boost performance.<br><br> Setting this property leads to faster data retrieval and improved system stability, especially during peak usage times.|true||

### Configure the advanced options

1. Follow the steps to view the Power Query code from Power BI Advanced Editor
1. In **Advanced Editor**, locate the line that starts with `Source =`:

   ```powerquery
   Source = Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions(null, null, null, null),
   ```

1. In the line, replace the fourth parameter of `Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions` with a Power Query record of properties and values you want to set, for example:

   ```powerquery
   Source = Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions(null, null, null, [UseReadOnlyReplica = true, Timeout = Duration.From("00:07:00"), ODataMaxPageSize = 10000, AcceptLanguage = "it-it"])
   ```

6. Select **Done** to close **Advanced Editor**.
7. Select **Close & Apply** to save the changes and close Power Query Editor.

## Fixing problems

### "Expression.Error: The environment 'Production' does not exist." error when specifying a Business Central environment

> **APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online

When you connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online from [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)], or when you install a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)] app from Microsoft AppSource that uses [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data, you might be prompted to input the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment you want to connect to.

If you get an error similar to "Expression.Error: The environment 'Production' does not exist.", follow these steps to troubleshoot:

1. Make sure you're using the right credentials to access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. These credentials might not be the same credentials you use to access [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)]. [How do I change or clear the account I'm currently using to connect to Business Central from Power BI Desktop?](/dynamics365/business-central/power-bi-faq?tabs=designer#perms)
2. If your environment is an embedded ISV environment, you need to specify the embedded ISV name in parenthesis as part of the environment name. For example, if you want to connect to an environment named Production from the embedded ISV named Fabrikam, you must specify "PRODUCTION (fabrikam)" as environment name.

### "Can't insert a record. Current connection intent is Read-Only." error connecting to custom API page

> **APPLIES TO:** Business Central online

By default, reports that use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data connect to a read-only replica of the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database. In rare cases, depending on the API design, you might get an error when you try to connect to and get data from the API. The error looks like this:

`Dynamics365BusinessCentral: Request failed: The remote server returned an error: (400) Bad Request. (Can't insert a record. Current connection intent is Read-Only. CorrelationId: [...])".`

If you're using a custom API, we recommend you rework the AL code to make sure it doesn't make database modifications when it's just reading data. But in case your scenario requires it, you can [configure the connector to use a read-write connection instead](#advanced-customize-language-timeout-database-replica-or-page-size-for-your-business-central-data-source).

# Analyze Data with Statistical Accounts

Use statistical accounts to supplement information in financial reports. Statistical accounts let you add metrics that are based on non-transactional data. You add the non-transactional data as number-based units, such as:

* Employee headcount
* Square footage
* The number of customers with overdue accounts

For example, you can measure revenue or costs based on the number of people in a department. The headcount for the department is the unit for the statistical account. The following image shows an example of a report that uses a statistical account to show revenue per employee.

:::image type="content" source="media/statistical account report example.png" alt-text="An example of a report that includes data from a statistical account.":::

In terms of how they work, statistical accounts are similar to posting accounts. They store transactions that you post using statistical account journals, so that you can use the transactions as data for financial reports. To learn more about financial reports, go to [Prepare Financial Reporting with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md). 

There are a couple of key differences between statistical accounts and posting accounts. Statistical accounts are separate entities, and aren't included in trial balance reports. Also, you don't need to balance debit and credit amounts when you use statistical account journals to post entries to a statistical account. You just post the amount.

## Set up a statistical account

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Statistical Accounts**, then choose the related link.
1. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Post amounts to a statistical account

1. To post the amounts you want to track, on the **Statistical Accounts** page, choose the **Statistical Accounts Journal** action.
1. In the **Posting date** field, enter the last date of the posting period that you want to post amounts for.
1. Optional: If you want to track amounts for a specific document, in the **Document No.** field, enter the document's ID.
1. In the **Statistical Account No.** field, choose the statistical account that you'll post amounts to.
1. In the **Description** field, enter a brief description of what you're measuring.  
1. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount to post. 
1. Optional: If you'll want to include the statistical account in more advanced analyses, specify dimensions in the **Department Code** and **Customergroup Code** fields. To learn more about dimensions, go to [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

## Verify statistical account amounts

On the **Statistical Accounts** page, use the **Statistical Accounts Balance** action to verify that the registered amounts are correct for each period.  

## Include the statistical account in a financial report

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.
1. Create a new financial report in one of the following ways:
    1. To start from scratch, choose **New**. To learn more about creating financial reports, go to [Create a new financial report](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md#create-a-new-financial-report).
    1. To use settings from a similar report you already have, choose the report to copy, and then choose the **Copy Financial Report** action. You can edit the settings you copy in your new report.
1. Add the statistical account:
    1. If you're starting from scratch, choose the **Edit Row Definition** action.
    1. To use a row definition from an existing report, choose the report to copy from, and then choose the **Copy Row Definition** action.
1. On the **Row Definition** page, in the **Row No.** field, define where the row will appear in the sequence of rows on the report.
1. In the **Description** field, enter text that indicates what you're measuring.
1. In the **Totaling Type** field, choose **Statistical Accounts**.
1. In the **Totaling** field, choose a statistical account.
1. In the **Row Type** field, choose whether to view the balance on the posting date or the beginning of the posting period, or to show the change to the amount during the period.
1. Fill in the remaining fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

# Work with recurring revenue in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

Many companies are moving from a business revenue model where revenue is made from a customer's one-time purchase to a subscription model where revenue is made on a recurring basis in return for consistent access to the delivery of a good or service.
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has the following options for automating how you send subscription invoices to your customers and register recurring revenue. 

## Register revenue with a recurring general journal

A recurring journal is a general journal with specific fields for managing transactions that you post frequently with few or no changes, such as rent, subscriptions, electricity, or heat. Using these fields for recurring transactions, you can post both fixed and variable amounts. 
With a recurring journal, entries that are posted regularly need to be typed in only once. That is, the accounts, dimensions and dimension values, and so on, that you enter will remain in the journal after posting. If any adjustments are necessary, you can make them with each posting.

### Why use this option

With this option, you define flexible invoicing periods with [Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas).

However, with this option, you can't print and send invoices in the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

For more information, see [Work with Recurring Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md#work-with-recurring-journals).  

## Create multiple invoices based on a recurring project journal

The recurring job journal is a more advanced alternative to the general journal. You define Items, Resources, and G/L Accounts that must be repeated for each job and you specify the frequency of recurrence.  

After posting a recurring project journal, you can create multiple invoices with the **Create Job Sales Invoice** task. You can review and post created invoices in the **Sales Invoices** page.

### Why use this option

With this option, you follow the standard invoicing procedure with all the benefits of that, including standard and customer layouts for communication preferences. You can also define prices for each project individually.

However, for each new customer, you must create a new project and add lines to the recurring journal. 

For more information, see [Create project journal lines](projects-how-record-job-usage.md#to-create-project-journal-lines-manually) and [Create multiple project sales invoices](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md#to-create-multiple-project-sales-invoices).

## Create multiple invoices based on recurring sales lines

If you often need to create sales and purchase lines with similar information, you can set up recurring sales lines that you can then insert on recurring sales and purchase documents, for example, for recurring replenishment orders. Use the **Create Recurring Sales Invoices** batch job to create sales invoices according to recurring sales lines that are assigned to the customers and with posting dates within the valid-from and valid-to dates that you specify on the recurring sales lines.  

### Why use this option

With this option, you can assign the same recurring lines to multiple customers. You can define period of validity for the recurring sales lines for specific customer. You can assign multiple recurring lines to the same customer and all of them will be included in the invoice.

However, there's no way to set fixed prices for items because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the actual prices and discount valid on document date, trying to find best combination that gives the lowest price.  

For more information, see [Create Recurring Sales and Purchase Lines](sales-how-work-standard-lines.md).

## Recurring invoices with service contract

A service contract contains the service contract agreements between your customers and your company. A service contract includes service level agreements and the service items that you service as a part of the contract.  

You can define the starting date of the contract, the invoice period, whether or not the contract is prepaid, price update specifications if you plan to change prices while contract is active. You can use both service items or items in service contract lines.
You can create contract templates to define how to create certain types of contracts.  

### Why use this option

With this option, you use a part of the advanced service management functionality that not limited to issuing of recurring invoices but support repair shop and field service operations.

However, this option requires the Premium license. Setting up service management and maintaining it might not give huge advantages in simpler subscription scenarios.  

For more information, see [Work with Service Contracts and Service Contract Quotes](service-how-to-create-service-contracts-and-service-contract-quotes.md) and [Invoice several service contracts](service-how-create-invoices.md#to-invoice-several-service-contracts).

## Related features
There are several related capabilities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Blanket sales orders

A blanket sales order represents a framework for a long-term agreement between your company and your customer.
A blanket order is typically made when a customer has committed to purchasing large quantities that are to be delivered in several smaller shipments over a certain period of time. Often blanket orders cover only one item with predetermined delivery dates. The main reason for using a blanket order rather than a sales order is that quantities entered on a blanket order don't affect item availability, however it can be used for planning purposes.

#### Why use this option

With this option, you use the anticipated demand, so the information is considered during the normal planning routines. For more information, see [Demand Forecasts and Blanket Orders](design-details-central-concepts-of-the-planning-system.md#demand-forecasts-and-blanket-orders).  

However, the default version doesn't offer an out-of-the-box possibility to process multiple blanket orders in bulk.

For more information, see [Work with Blanket Sales Orders](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md).

### Recurring Orders (Norway)

You can use recurring orders to create blanket order templates so that sales orders can be created based on date intervals that you define. For example, if you deliver the same sales order every two weeks, you can use a blanket sales order and create recurring orders.
You can use recurring groups to define a range of parameters that show how you make the orders. These groups are assigned to blanket orders that have to be created regularly. To create the recurring orders, you'll have to periodically run the create recurring orders process. 

#### Why use this option

With this option, you can choose between fixed and "best" prices.

However, this is only available in Norway. Validity period can be defined on the recurring group level.

For more information, see [Recurring Orders](LocalFunctionality/Norway/recurring-orders.md).

### Recurring revenue and subscription billing by other providers

At [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/), you can get extensions for Business Central. Some extensions are provided by Microsoft, and other extensions are provided by other companies. The list of the extensions by other companies grows each month. So keep an eye out for [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646) and get apps to help you in your work in Business Central.

# Inspecting pages in Business Central

The page inspection feature enables you to get details about a page, providing insight into the page design, the different elements that comprise the page, and the source behind the data it displays. Page inspection is especially designed for administrators, power users, support personnel, and developers. It's ideal for learning the data model behind a page and troubleshooting. For example, if you're experiencing a problem with a page, you can use page inspection to get information to pass on to your system administrator or support personnel.

> [!NOTE]  
> With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2023 release wave 2, through page inspection, you can start Visual Studio Code from within the web client to further investigate and debug source code of an extension. For more information, see [Troubleshoot in Visual Studio Code directly from the web client](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-troubleshoot-vscode-webclient) in the Business Central Developer and IT Pro help.

[!INCLUDE [send-report-excel](includes/send-report-excel.md)]

## Work with page inspection

You start page inspection from the **Help & Support** page. Choose the question mark in the top right corner, choose **Help & Support**, and then choose **Inspect pages and data**. Or, you can just use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd>.

The **Page inspection** pane opens on the side. When the pane first opens, it shows information that pertains to the main page object.

Use the keyboard or pointing device to move focus to different elements on the page. When you select a FactBox or a part on the main page, the bounding area is highlighted by a border, and the **Page Inspection** pane shows information about the selected element. For example, the previous figure shows information about the list part in the **Sales Order** page. As you navigate to other pages in the application, the **Page Inspection** pane will automatically update with page information as you move along.

For more information about what is shown in page inspection, see [Inspecting and Troubleshooting Pages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-inspecting-pages) in the [!INCLUDE[dev-itpro-docs](includes/dev-itpro-docs.md)].

If you don't see the details that you expect to see in the **Page Inspection** pane, you probably don't have the required permissions, as described in the next section.

## Controlling access to page inspection details

As an administrator, you can control access to the full details that are shown in the **Page Inspection** pane by configuring the permissions that users have. To grant a user permission to the full details, give users **Execute** permission on the **System** object **5330**. You can grant this permission by using a permission set (such as **D365 Troubleshoot**) or a user group (such as **D365 Troubleshoot**). For more information about permissions, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

Users who aren't granted permissions on **System object 5330** can still access the **Page Inspection** pane, but they will only see the **Page** and **Table** fields, which display basic details that they can pass on to their support team.

# Sales tax in the default version of Business Central

A **sales tax** is a tax that applies to the purchase of goods and services for consumers and to the sale of goods and services for businesses. Sales tax, ideally, should apply to all final consumption with few exemptions. Exemptions in final consumptions depend on local authorities but, generally speaking, business-to-business transactions are exempted from sales tax.  

Typically, sales taxes apply to the retail sale of goods and services and are a percentage of the total purchase amount. Retailers are responsible for calculating and collecting sales tax at the time of purchase.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available in countries/regions that use value-added tax (VAT) or that use sales tax. The default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has basic support for sales tax and richer support in the versions of the application used in the United States and Canada.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although sales tax is available in the default version, Microsoft supports the use of sales tax in the United States and Canada only.

# <a name="default"></a>Specify a default printer  

After printers have been set up in Business Central, you can then specify which printer you want to use by default for all companies in the environment. There are a couple of ways to specify printers to be used by default for reports and other print jobs. A default printer is useful if you work with different reports that require different printers because of their placement or their output capabilities.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The only printers that you can specify as default are **Microsoft Print to PDF** and cloud printers that have already been set up for use in Business Central, like Email printers and Universal Print printers. Cloud printers are typically set up by an admin. For more information, see [Printer Setup and Management](admin-printer-setup-overview.md).

## Set a printer as a default printer for all print jobs

Through the **Printer Management** page you set up a printer as a default printer for all print jobs. You can specify the printer as default for you only or for all users.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Printer Management**, then select the related link.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also open the **Printer Management** page from the **Printer Selections** page by choosing **Printer Management**.  
2. On the **Printer Management** page, select a printer from the list, choose **Manage**, then choose **Set as my default printer** or **Set as default printer for all users**.

> [!NOTE]
> Setting a default printer from the **Printer Management** adds an entry in the **Printer Selections**.

## Set a default printer for specific reports

The **Printer Selections** page lets you specify the printer a report use by default. Default printers are set on a user-account basis. You can set a default printer for just yourself, another user, or all users.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Printer Selections**, then select the related link. Alternatively, select a printer on the **Printer Management** page, then choose the **Printer Selections** action.
2. Choose the **New** action to add a printer selection for a specific report.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.

The specified report is now set up to print to the selected printer by default.

> [!NOTE]
> When you print the report in question, you can select a different using the **Print** field on the report request page.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't set a report up for a specific printer on the **Printer Selections** page, then it's printed to the default printer, as defined on the **Printer Management** page.

You or the administrator can also use the **Printer Selections** page to define other variations of printing for users and reports. The following table describes the combination of values to specify different printing setups for a report.

|To                                                 |Set the following values                                             |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Print a report to a specific printer for all users |Specify values in the **Report ID** and **Printer Name** fields and leave the **User ID** field blank.|
|Print all reports to a specific printer for a specific user|Specify values in the **User ID** and **Printer Name** fields and leave the **Report ID** field blank. This entry does the same as the **Set as my default printer** action on the **Print Management** page.|
|Set the default printer for all reports for all users|Specify a value in the **Printer Name** field and leave the **User ID** and **Report ID** fields blank. This entry does the same as the **Set as default printer for all users** action on the **Print Management** page.|
|Print a specific report to the user's default printer|Specify a value in the **Report ID** field and leave the **Printer Name** and **User ID** fields blank.|
|Print a specific report to a specific printer for a specific user|Specify values in all three fields.|

> [!NOTE]
> More specific printer selections take precedence over more general printer selections. For example, a printer selection that has values in the **User ID**, **Report ID**, and **Printer Name** fields takes precedence over a printer selection that has blank entries in the **User ID** or **Report ID** fields.

## Choosing the printer when running a report

Instead of using the default printer when running a report, you can override this setting from the request page. Simply choose the printer you want to use for this report generation in the **Printer** dropdown menu.

## Sizing print jobs

Cloud printing is designed for documents of a reasonable size. Most cloud services, including PrintNode and HP ePrint, have a limit of 10 MB per job. If you need to print larger reports, you may have to split them in multiple printouts.

title: Design Details - Revaluation

# Design Details: Revaluation

You can revalue the inventory based on the valuation base that most accurately reflects the inventory value. You can also backdate a revaluation to correctly update the cost of goods sold (COGS) for items you've already sold. Items that use the Standard costing method and aren't completely invoiced can also be revalued.  

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the following flexibility is supported regarding revaluation:  

- The revaluable quantity can be calculated for any date, also back in time.  
- For items using Standard costing method, expected cost entries are included in revaluation.  
- Inventory decreases affected by revaluation are detected.  

## Calculate the revaluable quantity

The quantity you can revalue is the remaining inventory that's available on a given date. The quantity is the total of completely invoiced item ledger entries that you post on or before the revaluation date.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Items using the Standard costing method are treated differently when calculating the revaluable quantity per item, location, and variant. The quantities and values of item ledger entries that are not completely invoiced are included in the revaluable quantity.  

After a revaluation has been posted, you can post an inventory increase or decrease with a posting date that comes before the revaluation posting date. However, this quantity will not be affected by the revaluation. To balance the inventory, only the original revaluable quantity is considered.  

Because you can revaluate on any date, you must have conventions for when you consider an item as part of inventory. For example, when the item is on inventory and when the item is work in process (WIP).  

### Example  

The following example illustrates when a WIP item transitions to become part of inventory. The example is based on the production of a chain with 150 links.  

![WIP inventory and revaluation.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_10_revaluation_wip.png "WIP inventory and revaluation")  

**1Q**: The user posts the purchased links as received. The following table shows the resulting item ledger entry.  

|Posting Date|Item|Entry Type|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------|----------------|--------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|LINK|Purchase|150|1|  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Now an item using the Standard costing method is available for revaluation.  

**1V**: The user posts the purchased links as invoiced and the links become part of inventory, from a financial point of view. The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|01-15-20|Direct Cost|01-01-20|150.00|1|1|  

 **2Q + 2V**: The user posts the purchased links as consumed for the production of the iron chain. From a financial point of view, the links become part of WIP inventory.  The following table shows the resulting item ledger entry.  

|Posting Date|Item|Entry Type|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------|----------------|--------------|---------------|  
|02-01-20|LINK|Consumption|-150|1|  

The following table shows the resulting value entry.  

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|02-01-20|Direct Cost|02-01-20|-150.00|2|2|  

The valuation date is set to the date of the consumption posting (02-01-20), as a regular inventory decrease.  

**3Q**: The user posts the chain as output and finishes the production order. The following table shows the resulting item ledger entry.  

|Posting Date|Item|Entry Type|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------|----------------|--------------|---------------|  
|02-15-20|CHAIN|Output|1|3|  

**3V**: The user runs the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, which posts the chain as invoiced to indicate that all material consumption has been completely invoiced. From a financial point of view, the links are no longer part of WIP inventory when the output is completely invoiced and adjusted. The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|01-15-20|Direct Cost|01-01-20|150.00|2|2|  
|02-01-20|Direct Cost|02-01-20|-150.00|2|2|  
|02-15-20|Direct Cost|02-15-20|150.00|3|3|  

## Expected cost in revaluation

The quantity you can revalue is the sum of the quantity for completely invoiced item ledger entries that you posted on or before the revaluation date. When some items are received or shipped but not invoiced, you can't calculate their inventory value. Items that use the Standard costing method are not limited in this way.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Another type of expected cost that can be revalued is WIP inventory, within certain rules. For more information, see [WIP Inventory Revaluation](design-details-revaluation.md#wip-inventory-revaluation).  

When you calculate the revaluable quantity for items that use the Standard costing method, the calculation includes item ledger entries that aren't completely invoiced. These entries are revalued when you post the revaluation. When you invoice the revalued entry, you create the following value entries:  

- The usual invoiced value entry with an entry type of **Direct Cost**. The cost amount on this entry is the direct cost from the source line.  
- A value entry with an entry type of **Variance**. This entry records the difference between the invoiced cost and the revalued standard cost.  
- A value entry with an entry type of **Revaluation**. This entry records the reversal of the revaluation of the expected cost.

### Example  

The following example is based on the production of the chain in the previous example. This example illustrates how the three types of entries are created, based on the following scenario:  

1.  You post the purchased links as received with a unit cost of LCY 2.00.  
2.  You post a revaluation of the links with a new unit cost of LCY 3.00, updating the standard cost to LCY 3.00.  
3.  You post the original purchase of the chain links as invoiced, which creates the following value entries:  

    1.  An invoiced value entry with an entry type of **Direct Cost**.  
    2.  A value entry with an entry type of **Revaluation** to record the reversal of the revaluation of the expected cost.  
    3.  A value entry with an entry type of Variance, recording the difference between the invoiced cost and the revalued standard cost.  

The following table shows the results.  

|Step|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Cost Amount (Expected)|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|----------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|1.|01-15-20|Direct Cost|01-15-20|300.00|0.00|1|1|  
|2.|01-20-20|Revaluation|01-20-20|150.00|0.00|1|2|  
|3.a.|01-15-20|Direct Cost|01-15-20|-300.00|0.00|1|3|  
|3.b.|01-15-20|Revaluation|01-20-20|-150.00|0.00|1|4|  
|3.c.|01-15-20|Variance|01-15-20|0.00|450.00|1|5|  

## Determine whether revaluation affects an inventory decrease  

Use the date of the posting or the revaluation to determine whether an inventory decrease is affected by a revaluation.  

The following table shows the criteria that's used for an item that doesn't use the Average costing method.  

|Scenario|Entry No.|Timing|Affected by revaluation|  
|--------------|---------------|------------|-----------------------------|  
|A|Earlier than revaluation entry number|Earlier than revaluation posting date|No|  
|B|Earlier than revaluation entry no.|Equal to revaluation posting date|No|  
|C|Earlier than revaluation entry no.|Later than revaluation posting date|Yes|  
|D|Later than revaluation entry no.|Earlier than revaluation posting date|Yes|  
|E|Later than revaluation entry no.|Equal to revaluation posting date|Yes|  
|F|Later than revaluation entry no.|Later than revaluation posting date|Yes|  

### Example  

The following example illustrates revaluation of an item that uses the FIFO costing method. The example is based on the following scenario:  

1.  On 01-01-20, you post a purchase of 6 units.  
2.  On 02-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
3.  On 03-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
4.  On 04-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
5.  On 03-01-20, you calculate the inventory value for the item, and post a revaluation of the item’s unit cost from LCY 10.00 to LCY 8.00.  
6.  On 02-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
7.  On 03-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
8.  On 04-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
9. You run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.  

The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Scenario|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Valued Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|--------------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
||01-01-20|Purchase|01-01-20|6|60.00|1|1|  
||03-01-20|Revaluation|03-01-20|4|-8.00|1|5|  
|A|02-01-20|Sale|02-01-20|-1|-10.00|2|2|  
|B|03-01-20|Sale|03-01-20|-1|-10.00|3|3|

||04-01-20|Sale|04-01-20|-1|2.00|7|12|  

## WIP inventory revaluation  

Revaluating WIP inventory implies that you revalue components that are registered as WIP inventory.  

It's important to have conventions that control when an item is WIP inventory from a financial point of view. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the following conventions exist:  

- A purchased component becomes part of the raw material inventory when you post a purchase as invoiced.  
- A purchased/sub-assembled component becomes part of the WIP inventory when you post its consumption with a production order.  
- A purchased/sub-assembled component remains part of the WIP inventory until you invoice a production order (manufactured item).  

The way the valuation date for the value entry of consumption is set follows the same rules as for non-WIP inventory. To learn more, go to [Determine whether revaluation affects an inventory decrease](#determine-whether-revaluation-affects-an-inventory-decrease).  

You can revalue WIP inventory under the following conditions:

- The revaluation date is before the posting dates of the corresponding item ledger entries of type Consumption.
- You haven't invoiced the production order.  

> [!CAUTION]  
> The **Inventory Valuation - WIP** report shows the value of posted production order entries, and might be a little confusing for revalued WIP items.  

## Revaluate items with the Average costing method

You can only revaluate items that use the Average costing method if **Calculate Per** is *Item*.

You can only do revaluation at the end of the period selected in the **Average Cost Period** field on the **Inventory Setup** page.

Revaluation won't affect negative transactions in the current month, which is why fully applied inbound entries aren't included either.

### Example

This example shows what happens when you calculate the inventory value on the **Item Revaluation Journal** page. On the **Inventory Setup** page, **Item** is chosen in the **Average Cost Calc. Type** field, and **Month** is chosen in the **Average Cost Period** field.

The following table shows item ledger entries for the sample average-cost item, ITEM1.

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|
|----|----|----|----|----|
25-04-23|Purchase|5|5.00|1
26-04-23|Purchase|3|3.00|2
27-04-23|Sale|-5|-5.00|3
28-04-23|Sale|-1|-1.00|4
13-05-23|Purchase|2|20.00|5
17-06-23|Sale|-6|-22.00|6

The following table shows the result of running the **Calculate Inventory Value** report with different posing dates.

|Posting Date|Quantity|Comment|
|---|---|-------------|
30-04-23|2|Includes only the remaining quantity from entry 2. Entry 1 is completely applied before the posting date, and entry 5 is after posting date.
31-05-23|4|Includes the remaining quantities from entries 2 and 13.
30-06-23|0|No remaining quantity at posting date.

The result of the following entries will be 0, regardless of the posting date.

# Work with calendar dates and times

You can enter dates and times in multiple ways. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)] includes powerful features that accelerate data entry, or help you write complex calendar expressions. There are various places throughout the application where you can enter dates and times in fields. For example, on a sales order, you can set the shipment date. When filtering lists or report data, you can enter dates and times to pinpoint only the data that you're interested in.

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## Check your region and language settings

The **My Settings** page specifies the **Region** and **Language** that you're using in the application. These settings influence how you enter dates and times.

- The **Region** setting determines how dates, times, numbers, and currencies are shown or formatted.

- For date patterns that involve words, the language of the words that you use must correspond to the **Language** setting.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)] uses the Gregorian calendar system.

## Entering dates

In a date field, you can enter a date using the standard format for your region setting. Different regions can use different separators between the days, months, and years. For example, some regions use dashes (mm-dd-yyyy) and others use forward slashes (mm/dd/yyyy).  

> [!TIP]
> You can use any separators, even a space, and the date will automatically be changed to use separators that match your region.

> [!NOTE]
> The format in which dates are displayed on printed reports or emailed documents isn't influenced by your personal choice of region setting.

To work more productively with dates and times, you can use any of the methods or formats that are described in the following sections.

### Picking dates from the calendar

Any field displaying a calendar icon can be set using the calendar date picker. To display the calendar date picker, activate the calendar icon or select the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Home</kbd> keyboard shortcut in the field.

![Date fields.](media/ui-date-field.png "Example of a date field")

See also [Keyboard Shortcuts in the calendar date picker](keyboard-shortcuts.md#calendarshortcuts).

### Day\-week\-year pattern

You can enter a date as a weekday followed by a week number and, optionally, a year. For example, Mon25 or mon25 means Monday in week 25. If you don't enter a year, the year of the work date is used.

Instead of entering the entire word for the day of the week, you can enter part of the word, starting from the beginning. If there were conflicts (such as with s which could be Saturday or Sunday), the days are evaluated according to the region setting. The input is first evaluated against work date and today as well, which you want to keep in mind when abbreviating. For example, _t_ already means today, so it can't mean Tuesday or Thursday.

The week number scheme is always ISO 8601, where week 1 is the week with 4 January in it, or the week with the first Thursday of the year.

### Digit patterns

In a date field you can enter two, four, six, or eight digits:

- Two digits are interpreted as the day, and it adds the month and the year of the work date.

- Four digits are interpreted as the day and the month, and it adds the year of the work date. Your region settings determine the order of the day and month. Even if your region settings have the year before the day and month, four digits are interpreted as the day and month.

- If the date you want to enter is in the range 01/01/1950 through 12/31/2049, you can enter the year with two digits; otherwise, enter the year with four digits.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the two-digit year range may be different. Administrators can change the range by modifying the **CalendarTwoDigitYearMax** setting of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] server. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#General).

### Today

Enter the word for _today_, in the language specified on the **My Settings** page, to set the date on a record to today's date. Instead of entering the entire word, you can enter part of the word, starting from the beginning. For example, in English, you can enter _t_ or _tod_, as long as it isn't also the start of another word.

### Period

To filter on a specific accounting period, in a date field enter the letter p, or the word period, followed by a number that identifies the accounting period, like p2 or period4. The accounting period is relative to the fiscal year of the current work date that set in your Role Center. For example, if the work date is **03/21/22**, then _p1_, or just _p_, filters on the first accounting period of the fiscal year 2022 (such as 01/01/22..01/31/22). _p15_ filters on the 15th accounting period from the start of fiscal year 2022 (such as 03/01/23..03/31/23).

The accounting periods are defined on the **Accounting Periods** page. To view or change the accounting periods, open the page [here](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=100).

### Work Date

Use a work date to specify a date that isn't today's date on records. For example, a work date is useful when you need to set a particular date for multiple records. You specify the work date on the **My Settings** page. 

A fast way to enter the work date on records is to enter some or all of the word _work_. Start from the beginning of the word in the language in which you use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)]. For example, in English, you can enter _w_ or _work_. The language is also specified on the **My Settings** page.

If a work date isn't specified, today's date is used. To learn more, go to [Change Basic Settings, such as the Work Date](ui-change-basic-settings.md#work-date).

### Closing date

When you close a fiscal year, you can use closing dates to indicate that an entry is a closing entry. A closing date technically is between two dates, for example between December 31 and January 1.

To specify that a date is a closing date, put C just before the date, such as C123101. Use this format in combination with all the date patterns.

### Examples

The following table contains examples of dates using all the formats. It assumes region settings that format dates according to: **year.month.day.**, a week starting on Monday, and the English language.

|**Entry**      |**Interpretation**      |
|---------------|------------------------|
|2022.12.31.|2022.12.31.|
|221231|2022.12.31.|
|22.12.31.|2022.12.31.|
|22.12.31.|2022.12.31.|
|20221231|2022.12.31.|
|22/12,31|2022.12.31.|
|11|work date year.work date month.11.|
|1112|work date year.11.12.|
|t or today|today's date|
|p4|date range that includes the fourth accounting period, such as 04/01/20..04/30/20|
|w or work date|the working date|
|m or Monday|Monday of the work date week|
|tu or Tuesday|Tuesday of the work date week|
|sa or Saturday|Saturday of the work date week|
|s or Sunday|Sunday of the work date week|
|t23|Tuesday of week 23 of the work date year|
|t 23|Tuesday of week 23 of the work date year|
|t-1|Tuesday of week 1 of the work date year|

##  <a name="BKMK_SettingDateRanges"></a> Setting ranges

To display only the data contained in that range, on lists, totals, and reports you can filter on dates, times, and datetimes with a start value and optionally an end value. The standard rules apply to the way you set date ranges.

|**Meaning**|**Sample expression (Date)**|**Data included in the filter**|
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------|
|Interval|12 15 00..01 15 01<br /><br />..12 15 00<br /><br />p1..p4|Records with dates between and including 12 15 00 and 01 15 01.<br /><br />Records with dates of 12 15 00 or earlier.<br /><br />Date range that includes the second, third, and fourth accounting periods, such as 01/01/20..04/30/20.|
|Either/or|12 15 00\|12 16 00|Records with dates of either 12 15 00 or 12 16 00. If there are records with dates on both days, they all display.|
|Combination|12 15 00\|12 01 00..12 10 00  <br /><br />..12 14 00\|12 30 00..|Records with dates of 12 15 00 or on dates between and including 12 01 00 and 12 10 00.  <br /><br />Records with dates of 12 14 00 or earlier, or dates of 12 30 00 or later, that is, all records except records with dates between and including 12 15 00 and 12 29 00.|

You can use any of the valid formats in date range filters. For example, mon14 3..t 4p applied on a datetime field results in a filter from 3 AM on Monday in week 14 of the current work date year until today at 4PM.

## Use date formulas

A date formula is a short, abbreviated combination of letters and numbers that specifies how to calculate dates. You can enter date formulas in various date calculation fields or filters.

> [!NOTE]
> In all data formula fields, one day is automatically included to cover today as the day when the period starts. Accordingly, for example, if you enter 1W, then the period is actually eight days because today is included. To specify a period of seven days \(one true week\) including the period starting date, then you must enter 6D or 1W-1D.

Here are some examples of how date formulas can be used:

- The date formula in the recurring frequency field in recurring journals determines how often the entry on the journal line posts.
- The date formula in the **Grace Period** field for a specified reminder level determines the period of time that must pass from the due date (or from the date of the previous reminder) before a reminder is created.
- The date formula in the **Due Date Calculation** field determines how to calculate the due date on the reminder.

The date formula can contain a maximum of 20 characters, both numbers and letters. You can use the following letters, which are abbreviations for calendar units.

|  Letter  |  Meaning  |
|----------|----------------------|
|C|Current|
|D|Day\(s\)|
|W|Week\(s\)|
|M|Month\(s\)|
|Q|Quarter\(s\)|
|Y|Year\(s\)|

You can construct a date formula in three ways.

The following example shows how to use C, for current, and a time unit.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|CW|Current week|
|CM|Current month (last day of the month)|

The following example shows how to use a number and a time unit. A number can't be larger than 9999.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|10D|10 days from today|
|2W|2 weeks from today|

The following example shows how to use a time unit and a number.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|D10|The next 10th day of a month|
|WD4|The next 4th day of a week \(Thursday\)|

The following example shows how you can combine these three forms as needed.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|CM+10D|Current month \+ 10 days|

The following example shows how you can use a minus sign to indicate a date in the past.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|-1Y|1 year ago from today|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the location uses a base calendar, then the date formula that you enter in, for example, the **Shipping Time** field is interpreted according to the calendar working days. For example, 1W  means seven working days.
<!--
# Entering Date Ranges
You can set filters containing a start date and an end date to display only the data contained in that date range or time interval. Special rules apply to the way you set date ranges. Let's take the **Customer Top 10** as an example:

![Setting a date range in the request page for the Customer Top 10 list.](./media/ui-enter-date-ranges/customer-top10-list.png)

Here you can limit the report to a date range such as the past 2 weeks, or a total of 6 weeks, or whatever range you want. To set date ranges, you enter dates and then use either **..** or **|** to set the range. In our example, to show the top 10 customers for the first two weeks of May, you would set the date filter to *05 01 17..05 14 17*.
Here are a couple of other examples:

| Meaning | Example | Entries included |
|---|---|---|
|Equal to| 12 15 16 |Only those posted on December 15 2016.|
|Interval| 12 15 16..01 15 17<br /><br />..12 15 16|Those posted on dates between and including December 15 2016 and January 15 2017.<br /><br />Those posted on December 15 2016 or earlier.|
|Either/or|12 15 16&#124;12 16 16|Those posted on either December 15 or December 16 2016. If there are entries posted on both days, they will all be displayed.|

You can also combine the various format types.

| Example | Entries included |
|---|---|
|12 15 16&#124;12 01 16..05 31 17 | Entries posted either on December 15 2016 or on dates between and including December 01 2016 and May 31 2017. |
|..12 14 16&#124;12 30 16.. | Entries posted on December 14 or earlier, or entries posted on December 30 or later - that is, all entries except those posted on dates between and including December 15 and 29. |

Note that we have used the US date format MMDDYY here. As [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] becomes available in other markets, you'll be able to use the formats that you are used to.

## Use Date Formulas
A date formula is a short, abbreviated combination of letters and numbers that specifies how to calculate dates. You can enter date formulas in various date calculation fields and in recurring frequency fields in recurring journals.

> [!NOTE]
> In all data formula fields, one day is automatically included to cover today as the day when the period starts. Accordingly, for example, if you enter **1W**, then the period is actually eight days because today is included. To specify a period of seven days (one true week) including the period starting date, then you must enter **6D** or **1W\-1D**.

Here are some examples of how date formulas can be used:

- The date formula in the recurring frequency field in recurring journals determines how often the entry on the journal line will be posted.

- The date formula in the **Grace Period** field for a specified reminder level determines the period of time that must pass from the due date (or from the due date of the previous reminder) before a reminder will be created.

- The date formula in the **Due Date Calculation** field determines how to calculate the due date on the reminder.

The date calculation formula can contain a maximum of 20 characters, both numbers and letters. You can use the following letters, which are abbreviations for time specifications.

|  Letter  |  Time specification  |
|----------|----------------------|
|C|Current|
|D|Day\(s\)|
|W|Week\(s\)|
|M|Month\(s\)|
|Q|Quarter\(s\)|
|Y|Year\(s\)|

You can construct a date formula in three ways.

The following example shows how to use **C**, for current, and a time unit.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|CW|Current week|
|CM|Current month|

The following example shows how to use a number and a time unit. A number cannot be larger than 9999.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|10D|10 days from today|

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|D10|The next 10th day of a month|
|WD4|The next 4th day of a week \(Thursday\)|

The following example shows how you can combine these three forms as needed.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|CM\+10D|Current month \+ 10 days|

The following example shows how you can use a minus sign to indicate a date in the past.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|-1Y|1 year ago from today|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the location uses a base calendar, then the date formula that you enter in, for example, the **Shipping Time** field is interpreted according to the calendar working days. For example, **1W**  means seven working days.

-->

## Entering times

When you enter times, you can insert any nonspace separators that you want between the units. If you use double digits for each unit up to milliseconds, then it isn't required.

You only have to write the largest units that you require; the rest are set to zero. You can also leave out any AM/PM indicator.

The following table lists the various ways in which times can be entered and how they're interpreted. It assumes region settings that format times according to **Hours:Minutes:Seconds.Milliseconds** and use the AM and PM indicators.

|**Entry**      |**Interpretation**      |
|---------------|------------------------|
|05:23:17|05:23:17|
|5|05:00:00|
|5AM|05:00:00|
|5P|17:00:00|
|12|12:00:00|
|12A|00:00:00|
|12P|12:00:00|
|17|17:00:00|
|5:30|05:30:00|
|0530|05:30:00|
|5:30:5|05:30:05|
|053005|05:30:05|
|5:30:5,50|05:30:05.5|
|053005050|05:30:05.05|

> [!NOTE]
> Milliseconds are interpreted as decimal notation. So, for example, 3, 30, and 300 all mean 300 milliseconds, while 03 means 30 and 003 means 3 milliseconds.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't use 24:00 to mean midnight, or use any value greater than 24:00.

The word for *time* in the language used by [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)] is the current time on your computer or mobile device. You can enter a part of the word starting from the beginning, such as **t** or **TIM**.

## Entering combined dates and times

[!INCLUDE [datetimes](includes/datetimes.md)]

## Entering duration

Some fields in the application represent a duration, or amount of elapsed time, instead of a specific date or time. You enter a duration as a number followed by its unit of measure.

Here are some examples.

|**Duration**|**Unit of measure**|
|------------|-------------------|
|2h|2 hrs|
|6h 30 m|6 hrs 30 mins|
|6.5h|6 hrs 30 mins|
|90m|1 hr 30 mins|
|2d 6h 30m|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins|
|2d 6h 30m 56s 600ms|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins 56 secs 600 msecs|

You can also enter a number that automatically converts to a duration. The number converts according to the default unit of measure that is specified for the duration field.

It's easy to find out which unit of measure a duration field uses. Enter a number, and then look at the unit of measure it converts to.

For example, if the unit of measure is hours, the number 5 converts to 5 hrs.

# The C5 data migration extension

This extension makes it easy to migrate customers, vendors, items, and your general ledger accounts from Microsoft Dynamics C5 2012 to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can also migrate historical entries for general ledger accounts.

> [!NOTE]
> The company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] must not contain any data. Additionally, after you start a migration, do not create customers, vendors, items, or accounts until the migration finishes.

## What data is migrated?

The following data is migrated for each entity:

### Customers

* Contacts  
* Location
* Country
* Customer dimensions (department, center, purpose)
* Shipment method
* Sales Person
* Payment terms
* Payment method
* Customer price group
* Customer invoice discount

If you migrate accounts, the following data is also migrated:

* Customer posting setup
* General journal batch
* Open transactions (customer ledger entries)

### Vendors

* Contacts
* Location
* Country
* Vendor dimensions (department, center, purpose)
* Invoice discount
* Shipment method
* Purchaser
* Payment terms
* Payment method
* Vendor invoice discount

If you migrate accounts, the following data is also migrated:

* Vendor posting setup
* General journal batch
* Open transactions (vendor ledger entries)

### Items

* Location
* Country
* Item dimensions (department, center, purpose)
* Sales line discounts
* Customer discount groups
* Item discount groups
* Sales price
* Tariff number
* Units of measure
* Item tracking code
* Customer price group
* Assembly BOMs

If you migrate accounts, the following data is also migrated:

* Inventory posting setup
* General posting setup
* Item journal batch
* Open transactions (item ledger entries)

> [!NOTE]
> If there are open transactions that use foreign currencies, the exchange rates for those currencies are also migrated. Other exchange rates are not migrated.

### Chart of accounts

* Standard dimensions: Department, Cost Center, Purpose  
* Historical G/L transactions  

> [!NOTE]
> Historical G/L transactions are treated a little differently. When you migrate data you set a **Current Period** parameter. This parameter specifies how to process G/L transactions. Transactions after this date are migrated individually. Transactions before this date are aggregated per account and migrated as a single amount. For example, let's say there are transactions in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and you specify January 01, 2017 in the Current Period field. For each account, amounts for transactions on or before December 31, 2016, will be aggregated in a single general journal line for each G/L account. All transactions after this date will be migrated individually.

## File size requirements

The largest file size you can upload to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is 150 MB. If the file you export from C5 is larger than that, consider migrating data in multiple files. For example, export one or two types of entities from C5, such as customers and vendors, to a file, and then export items to another file, and so on. You can import files individually in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## To migrate data

There are just a few steps to export data from C5, and import it in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:  

1. In C5, use the **Export Database** feature to export the data. Then send the export folder to a compressed (zipped) folder.  
2. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Migration**, and then choose **Data Migration**.  
3. Complete the steps in the assisted setup guide. Make sure to choose **Import from Microsoft Dynamics C5 2012** as the data source.  

## Viewing the status of the migration

Use the **Data Migration Overview** page to monitor the success of the migration. The page shows information such as the number of entities that the migration includes, the status of the migration, and the number of items that have been migrated and whether they were successful. It also shows the number of errors, lets you investigate what went wrong and, when possible, makes it easy to go to the entity to fix the issues. For more information, see the next section in this article.  

> [!NOTE]
> While you are waiting for the results of the migration, you must refresh the page to display the results.

## How to avoid double-posting

To help avoid double-posting to the general ledger, the following balance accounts are used for open transactions:  

* For vendors, we use the A/P account from the vendor posting group.  
* For customers, we use the A/R account from the customer posting group.  
* For items, we create a general posting setup where the adjustment account is the account specified as the inventory account on the inventory posting setup.  

## Correcting errors

If something goes wrong and an error occurs, the **Status** field shows **Completed with Errors**, and the **Error Count** field will show how many. To view a list of the errors, you can open the **Data Migration Errors** page by choosing:  

* The number in the **Error Count** field for the entity.  
* The entity, and then the **Show Errors** action.  

On the **Data Migration Errors** page, to fix an error you can choose an error message, and then choose **Edit Record** to view the migrated data for the entity. If you have several errors to fix, you can choose **Bulk-Fix Errors** to edit the entities in a list. You still need to open individual records if the error was caused by a related entry, though. For example, a vendor won't be migrated if an email address one of their contacts has an invalid format.

After you fix one or more errors, you can choose **Migrate** to migrate only the entities you fixed, without having to completely restart the migration.  

> [!TIP]
> If you have fixed more than one error, you can use the **Select More** feature to select multiple lines to migrate. Alternatively, if there are errors that are not important to fix, you can choose them and then choose **Skip Selections**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have items that are included in a BOM, you might need to migrate more than once if the original item is not created before the variants that reference it. If an item variant is created first, the reference to the original item can cause an error message.  

## Verifying data after migrating

One way to verify that your data migrated correctly is to look at the following pages in C5 and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

|Microsoft Dynamics C5 2012 | Dynamics 365 Business Central| Batch Job to Use |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|------------------|
|Customer Entries| General Journals| CUSTMIGR |
|Vendor Entries| General Journals| VENDMIGR|
|Item Entries| Item Journals| ITEMMIGR |
|G/L Entries| General Journals| GLACMIGR |

## Stopping data migration

You can stop migrating data by choosing **Stop All Migrations**. If you do, all pending migrations are also stopped.

## Use the report

The report is ideal for business leaders and purchasing managers who need to monitor purchase performance in the last 12 months.
  
CEOs can use the report to monitor the overall purchasing performance over the last 12 months. You can analyze the figures for Moving Annual Total (MAT) and Previous Year Moving Annual Total (PYMAT) and identify trends in purchasing amounts in line with the company's growth. If your purchasing amount exceeds your growth rate, you can use this information to develop a strategic plan that focuses on reducing inventory costs or optimizing purchasing budget. The report can also help you identify periods of high purchasing costs and work with purchasing managers to reduce them.

Purchasing managers can use this report to analyze the purchasing data over the last 12 months, and analyze purchase amounts for specific periods. You can identify purchasing performance by analyzing the MAT growth and growth percentage in each month. These measures offer insight into how your team performs during each period. By identifying the areas where purchasing increased, you can take necessary actions to optimize the purchasing process and ensure you're using purchasing budget efficiently.

# Sustainability value chain in production

The requirement for enabling the sustainability value chain in manufacturing processes is to enable the **Enable Value Chain tracking**, **Item Emissions**, and **Work/Machine Center Emissions** fields on the **Sustainability Setup** page.  

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Check whether the basic setup already exists. If it doesn't, follow [these instructions](finance-sustainability-setup.md) to set it up.  
3. On the **Procurement** FastTab, fill in the following fields:
   1. **Enable Value Chain tracking** to enable sustainability value entry posting through value chain operations and the visibility of these fields on operational documents and journals.
   2. **Item Emissions** to enable a default sustainability account and emissions on the **Item Card** page.  
   3. **Work/Machine Center Emissions** to enable default sustainability accounts and emissions on the **Work Center** and **Machine Center** pages.  
4. Close the page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because the sustainability value chain works only with the carbon equivalent (CO2e), before you start, configure the **Carbon Equivalent Factors** on the **Emission Fees** page. To learn more, go to [Emission fees](value-chain-howto-setup.md#emission-fees).  

## Working with a production BOM

To learn more about how to work with the **Production BOM**, go to [How to create a production BOM](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md). This article only covers the effect of CO2e emissions on production BOMs.  

If you set up default emissions for items you plan to use on production BOM lines, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically fills in the **CO2e per Unit** field for each line when you create a new production BOM. However, if you created a production BOM before you configured emissions for items, or if you updated the emission values for items, you can run the **Calculate CO2e** action. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates all **CO2e per Unit** values using the latest emission details from the items. You can even run the **Calculate CO2e** action from the **Production BOMs** page to update all production BOMs with the latest emissions.

## Working with routings

To learn more about how to work with routes, go to [How to create a route with production operations](production-how-to-create-routings.md). This article only explains the effect of CO2e emissions on routes.

If you set up default emissions for work or machine centers you plan to use in the **Routing** lines, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically fills in the **CO2e per Unit** field for each line when you create a new routing. However, if you created a routing before you configured emissions for work or machine centers, or if you updated the emission values for them, you can run the **Calculate CO2e** action. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates all **CO2e per Unit** values using the latest emission details from the work or machine centers.

## Working with production orders  

To learn more about how to work with production orders, go to [About production orders](production-about-production-orders.md) and [How to create production orders](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md). However, the connection of production orders with the sustainability value chain is:

- Tracking the emissions for items and work or machine centers consumed during the production process.
- Transferring the total emission values to the produced items or finished goods.  

To use a production order in the sustainability value chain process, add CO2e (carbon equivalent) emissions in all posted entries through the journals you use in the production process. You can start the process using a **Released Production Order**. To use the sustainability value chain in production orders, all items (raw materials) and work or machine centers you want to use must have a **Sustainability Account No.** and emissions.  

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Released production orders**, and then select the related link.
2. Create a new production order. To learn more about production orders, go to [How to create a production order](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md).
3. Run the **Refresh Production Order** action to calculate values for the line.  
4. After you refresh the order, the value in the **Total CO2e** field updates based on emissions in the production BOM and routing for the production items.

When you refresh the production order, values from the production BOM and routing transfer to the **Prod. Order Components** and **Prod. Order Routing** pages for the production order you're using. If you change the initial production BOM and routing, it doesn't affect the production order you refreshed previously.  

To check the emission values, run the **Routing** or **Components** actions from the production order lines.  

> [!NOTE]
> Although the **Total CO2e** emission amount displays for each line on the **Prod. Order Components** and **Prod. Order Routing** pages, there's a field called **CO2e per Unit**. Its value comes from the **Item**, **Work Center** or **Machine Center** pages, and is used for calculations. However, if you change the value in the **Total CO2e** field on the line, the **CO2e per Unit** recalculates based on the total emission and quantity for that line.  

### Posting transactions related to production order  

To post all transactions related to the production order and record the emissions, choose one of the following journals:  

- Production journals
- Consumption journals
- Output journals

#### Production journals  

Production journals combine the functions of the separate consumption journal and output journals into one journal. The combined journal is accessed directly from a released production order. To learn more, go to [How to register consumption and output for a released production order line](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md). Related to emissions, be sure that all lines have a value in the **CO2e per Unit** field.

Every time you post the journal, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates sustainability value entries. You can access these entries from the **Release Production Order** page by running the **Sustainability Value Entries** action.  

#### Consumption journals

To learn more about consumption journals, go to [Batch post production consumption](production-how-to-post-consumption.md). It's important to know that all emissions are updated by posting these journals for all consumption transactions. When you post a journal, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates sustainability value entries with the **Consumption** option as the **Item Ledger Entry Type**.  

#### Output journals

To learn more about output journals, go to [Batch post output and run times](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md). It's important to know that all emissions are updated by posting these journals for all output transactions based on the routings. When you post the journal, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates sustainability value entries with the **Output** option as the **Item Ledger Entry Type** for the finished good production. It also creates transactions for the work or machine centers you used related to the capacity ledger entry.  

### Finish a production order

When you finish a production order, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the value of your produced item and the **CO2e per Unit** field on the **Item Card** page for it.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the value in the **CO2e per Unit** field for the produced item by summing the total emissions from all consumed items and operations (work and machine centers), and then divide that by the total output quantity.

# Set up an additional reporting currency

As companies operate in increasingly more countries/regions, it becomes more important that they're able to review and report financial data in more than one currency.

> [!NOTE]  
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], if you're looking for real time information about foreign exchange (FX) rates or historical rates, it's referred to as currency. In addition to this article, see also [Update Currency Exchange Rates](finance-how-update-currencies.md).

Your general ledger is set up to use your local currency (LCY), but you can set it up to also use another currency with a current exchange rate assigned. If you designate a second currency as an additional reporting currency (ACY), [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically records amounts in both LCY and ACY on each G/L entry and other entries, such as VAT entries.

> [!Warning]
> You shouldn't use the ACY feature as a basis for financial statement translation unless you understand its limitations. It can't translate foreign subsidiary financial statements as part of a company consolidation. The ACY can only be used to prepare reports in another currency, as if that currency was the company's LCY.
>
> For example, you have a large amount of accounts receivable in British pounds (GBP), and you have set up your ACY to be GBP. In this scenario, amounts in the accounts receivable that use GBP aren't adjusted for currency exchange gains/losses in the ACY, only amounts in the accounts receivable that are in other currencies. That means that if you use ACY to report your financial statements, it might result in understated or overstated outstanding balances of accounts receivable.

## Displaying reports and amounts in ACY

Using an ACY can assist the reporting process for a company in the following cases:

- Companies in non-EU countries/regions that have a high proportion of transactions with EU country/region companies. In this case, the non-EU company might also want to report in euro to make its financial reports more usable for EU trade partners.
- Companies that also wish to display reports in a more internationally traded currency than their own local currency.

Several financial reports are based on G/L entries. To display report data in the ACY, select the **Show Amounts in Add. Reporting Currency** checkbox on the **Options** FastTab for the relevant G/L report.

## Adjusting exchange rates

Because exchange rates fluctuate constantly, ACY equivalents in your system must be adjusted periodically. If these adjustments aren't done, amounts that converted from foreign (or additional) currencies and posted to the general ledger in LCY can be misleading. In addition, daily entries posted before a daily exchange rate is entered into application must be updated after the daily exchange rate information is entered. The **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job is used to adjust the exchange rates of posted customer, vendor, and bank account entries. It can also update ACY amounts on G/L entries. For more information, see [Update Currency Exchange Rates](finance-how-update-currencies.md).

## Setting up an ACY

To set up an ACY, follow these steps:

- Specify general ledger accounts for posting exchange rate adjustments.  
- Specify the exchange rate adjustment method for all general ledger accounts.  
- Specify the exchange rate adjustment method for VAT entries.  
- Activate the ACY.  

### To specify general ledger accounts for posting exchange rate adjustments  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Currencies**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Currencies** page, fill in the following fields for the ACY.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Realized GL Gains Account**|The general ledger account to which exchange rate gains for currency adjustments between LCY and the ACY are posted.|  
|**Realized GL Losses Account**|The general ledger account to which exchange rate losses for currency adjustments between LCY and the ACY are posted.|  
|**Residual Gains Account**|The general ledger account to which residual amounts that are gains are posted if you post in the general ledger application area in both LCY and an ACY.|  
|**Residual Losses Account**|The general ledger account to which residual amounts that are losses are posted if you post in the general ledger application area in both LCY and an ACY.|

> [!NOTE]  
> Residual amounts can occur when [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] rounds debit and credit amounts that have been converted from LCY to an ACY.  

For each general ledger account, you must specify how general ledger amounts for that account are adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations between LCY and the ACY.  

### To specify the exchange rate adjustment method for all general ledger accounts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, select the relevant account, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. On the **GL Account Card** page, select the relevant method in the **Exchange Rate Adjustment** field.  

    If you post in an ACY, in the **Exchange Rate Adjustment** field, specify how this general ledger account is adjusted for exchange-rate fluctuations between LCY and the ACY. The following table describes the options.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No Adjustment**|No exchange rate adjustment is made to the general ledger account. This setting is the default option.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** Select this option if the exchange rate between the LCY and ACY is always fixed.|  
    |**Adjust Amount**|The LCY amount is adjusted for any exchange rate gains or losses. Exchange rate gains or losses are posted to the general ledger account in the **Amount** field and to the accounts you specified for gains or losses in the **Realized G/L Gains Account** and **Realized G/L Losses Account** fields on the **Currencies** page.|  
    |**Adjust Additional-Currency Amount**|The ACY is adjusted for any exchange rate gains or losses. Exchange rate gains or losses are posted to the general ledger account in the **Additional-Currency Amount** field and to the accounts you specified for gains or losses in the **Realized G/L Gains Account** and **Realized G/L Losses Account** fields on the **Currencies** page.|  

    Exchange rate gains and losses are posted when you run the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job. In that batch job, the adjustment exchange rate is identified on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page, and then the amounts in the **Amount** and **Additional-Currency Amount** fields on the general ledger entry are compared to determine whether there's an exchange rate gain or loss. The batch job uses the option that you select in the **Exchange Rate Adjustment** field to determine how to calculate and post exchange rate gains or losses for general ledger accounts.  

4.  Close the **G/L Account Card** page.  

### To specify exchange rate adjustment method for VAT entries

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, select the relevant method in the **VAT Exchange Rate Adjustment** field.  
3. If you post in an ACY, in the **VAT Exchange Rate Adjustment** field you can specify how the accounts set up for VAT posting on the **VAT Posting Setup** page are adjusted for exchange-rate fluctuations between LCY and the ACY.  

    When you run the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job, the adjustment exchange rate is identified on the **Currency Exchange Rate** page and then the amounts in the **Amount** and **Additional-Currency Amount** fields on the VAT entry are compared to determine if there's an exchange rate gain or loss. The batch job uses the option that you select in this field to determine how to post exchange rate gains or losses for VAT accounts.  

    You have the same options as with general ledger entries but in this case the entries adjusted are the VAT entries. The following table describes the options.

    |Field|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No Adjustment**|No exchange rate adjustment is made to the general ledger account. This setting is the default option.|  
    |**Adjust Amount**|The LCY amount is adjusted for any exchange rate gains or losses. Exchange rate gains or losses are posted to the general ledger account in the **Amount** field and to the accounts you specified for gains or losses in the **Realized G/L Gains Account** and **Realized G/L Losses Account** fields on the **Currencies** page.|  
    |**Adjust Additional-Currency Amount**|The ACY is adjusted for any exchange rate gains or losses. Exchange rate gains or losses are posted to the general ledger account in the **Additional-Currency Amount** field and to the accounts you specified for gains or losses in the **Realized G/L Gains Account** and **Realized G/L Losses Account** fields on the **Currencies** page.|  

### To activate the ACY  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, in the **Additional Reporting Currency** field, choose the additional currency that you want to report in.  
3. When you leave the field, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] displays a confirmation message describing the effects of activating the ACY.  
4. Choose the **Yes** button to confirm that you want to activate the currency.  
5. The **Adjust Add. Reporting Currency** batch job opens.

    This batch job converts LCY amounts on existing entries to the ACY. The batch job uses a default exchange rate copied from the exchange rate that is valid on the work date on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page. Residual amounts that occur on conversion of LCY to ACY are posted to the residual gains and losses accounts specified on the **Currencies** page. The posting date and document number for these entries are the same as for the original general ledger entry. After you post all residual entries, the batch job posts a rounding entry on the closing date of each closed year to the retained earnings account. This posting makes sure that the ending balance of the income accounts for each closed year is 0 in both LCY and the ACY.
6. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]      
7. Choose the **OK** button to run the batch job.  

After you run the batch job, amounts on the following existing entries are in both the LCY and ACY:  

- General ledger entries  
- Item application entries  
- VAT entries  
- Project ledger entries  
- Value entries  
- Production order lines  
- Production order ledger entries  

In addition, all future entries of the same type have amounts recorded in both LCY and the ACY.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Add. Reporting Currency** field will only be activated after you choose the **OK** button in the **Adjust Add. Reporting Currency** batch job.

# Define an invoice posting policy for users

Companies often have unique processes for posting sales and purchase invoices and shipments. For example, processes can vary from one person posting everything on a purchase order, to multiple employees. You can restrict users from posting invoices, or require that invoices are posted together with shipments or receipts.

## To specify a posting policy

On the **User Setup** page, in the **Sales Invoice Posting Policy** and **Purch. Invoice Posting Policy** fields, choose one of the following options:

* **Allowed** (Default) - Keep the current behavior, where a user can choose the posting option to use, such as **Ship**, **Invoice**, and **Ship and Invoice**. 
* **Prohibited** - Prevent the user from posting invoices. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows a confirmation dialog that provides only the **Ship** or **Receive** options.
* **Mandatory** - Allow the user to post invoices together with receipts or shipments. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows a confirmation dialog with the **Ship and Invoice** or **Receive and Invoice** options.

## Effect on documents

The following table describes how invoice posting policies affect documents.

> [!NOTE]
> When you post sales and purchase invoices and credit memos, you don't have any posting options. The documents always post the physical and financial transactions together. You can't partially post invoices and credit memos.

|Document | Option 1: Allow <br>Displays a series of options| Option 2: Prohibited <br>Confirmation dialog | Option 3: Mandatory <br>Confirmation dialog|
|--|--|--|--|
|Sales order |- Ship <br>- Invoice <br>- Ship and Invoice |Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|
|Sales invoice|No options| Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the invoice?|
|Sales credit memo|No options|Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the credit memo?|
|Sales return order |- Receive <br>- Invoice <br>- Receive and Invoice |Do you want to post the receipt? |Do you want to post the receipt and invoice?|
|Inventory pick |- Ship <br>- Ship and Invoice |Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|
|Purchase order |- Receive <br>- Invoice <br>- Receive and Invoice |Do you want to post the receipt? |Do you want to post the receipt and invoice?|
|Purchase invoice|No options|Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the invoice?|
|Purchase credit memo|No options|Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the credit memo?|
|Purchase Return Order |- Ship <br>- Invoice <br>- Ship and Invoice |Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|
|Inventory Put-away |- Receive <br>- Receive and Invoice |Do you want to post the receipt? |Do you want to post the receipt and invoice?|
|Warehouse Shipment |- Ship <br>- Ship and Invoice | Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|

   > [!Note]
   > The setting doesn't affect posting of general journal lines where you can select **Invoice** in the **Document Type** field.

# Ad-hoc analysis of sustainability data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze sustainability data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Emission overview" or "Emission By Scope," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on sustainability

The information that you enter in a sustainability journal is temporary and you can change it while it's in the journal. When you post a sustainability journal, the information is transferred to sustainability ledger entries on individual sustainability accounts, where you can't change it. However, you can post reversing or correcting entries. The [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220) list page is the main data source for ad-hoc analysis of sustainability data.

To learn more about posting sustainability entries, go to [Record sustainability entries](finance-sustainability-journal.md).

# Design your own financial reports

You can use financial reporting to create custom reports. For example, if you want more complex reports.

To create a new financial report, choose the **New** action. You can then give the report a name and add a description. Afterward, you can specify default settings for the report, such as:

* **Row Definition**
* **Column Definition**
* **Analysis Views**

## Copy an existing report

To copy an existing report, use the **Copy Financial Report** action. When you choose this option, you can rename the copied report. You can also copy and rename individual row definitions and column definitions.  

## Create your own row definition

To create your own row definition, choose **Edit Row Definition**. To explore existing row definitions, choose the **Name** field. Choose **New**, and give the row definition a name and description.

You now have a blank row definition that you can use to build your new report.  

> [!TIP]
> Take a moment to personalize your screen to show only the **Row No.**, **Description**, **Totaling Type**, **Totaling**, **Row Type**, and **Bold** columns. These columns are recommended as the minimum columns needed for a basic row definition. There are many columns available, which can be used as you become familiar with creating more advanced financial reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

When getting started with financial reporting, there are a few choices we recommended in fields. The following table describes the recommended choices.

|Field  |Option  |
|---------|---------|
|Row No.     |Alpha, numeric, or alphanumeric codes are used here to identify rows in formulas.         |
|Description  |Specifies the words to label each row of the report.         |
|Totaling Type    |The **Posting Accounts** and **Formulas** options are often used.         |
|Totaling     | Together with the **Totaling Type** of **Posting Accounts**, maps general ledger accounts to the report, either individually or in ranges.<br><br> Together with **Totaling Type** of the **Formula**, uses row references to the **Row No.** field to do basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.          |
|Row Type     |**Net Change** is used for income statement reports.<br><br>**Balance at Date** is used for balance sheet reports.<br><br>**Beginning Balance** is used for cash flow statements.          |
|Bold     |  Simple formatting to apply to headers, subtotals, and other elements of the report that you want to emphasize.       |

## When to show the opposite sign in rows and columns

Use the **Show Opposite Sign** option to show the opposite sign in a credit balance account, such as revenue, for reports you present to people who aren't accountants.

> [!TIP]
> It's important to remember that you should use the **Show Opposite Sign** option on the posting account line for the account where the sign needs to be flipped. If you use the option on a formula such as gross margin, where both revenue and cost of goods sold are represented, the calculation will be incorrect. Pay extra attention when you use the setting in formulas.

## Create your own column definition

To create your own column definition, choose **Edit Column Definition**. To explore existing definitions, choose the **Name** field. Choose **New**, and give the new column definition a name and a description.

You now have a blank column definition that you can use to build your new report.  

> [!TIP]
> Take a moment to personalize your screen to show only the **Column No.**, **Column Header**, **Column Type**, **Ledger Entry Type**, **Budget Name**, **Formula**, and **Comparison Period Formula** columns. These columns are recommended as the minimum needed for a basic column definition. There are many columns available, which you can use as you become more familiar with creating advanced financial reports.

When getting started with financial reporting, there are a few field choices we recommended. The following table describes the recommendations.

|Field  |Option  |
|---------|---------|
|Column No.     |Alpha, numeric, or alphanumeric codes are used here to identify columns in formulas.         |
|Column Header     |Used to hold the words used to label each column of the report.         |
|Column Type     |The often used options are **Net Change**, **Balance at Date**, and **Formula**.<br><br>**Net Change** is used for income statement reports.<br><br>**Balance at Date** is used for balance sheet reports.<br><br>**Formula** uses row references to Column No. to do basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.          |
|Ledger Entry Type     |Entries are used for general ledger entries.<br><br>**Budget Entries** are used for budget entry comparisons.         |
|Budget Name     |When using budget entries, select the budget to use.         |
|Formula     | Formula uses row references to Column No. to do basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.        |
|Comparison Period Formula     | Holds various period-related formulas that determine the period for the report combined with the date filter.        |

## When to use a comparison period formula and comparison date formula in a column definition

There are two options for column definition comparisons for accounting periods:

* Comparison period formula
* Comparison date formula

Comparison period formula is often used for reports that show monthly, quarterly, or annual accounting periods. In most cases, financial reports use these increments of time.  

Comparison date formula is typically used for reports that show weekly or daily accounting periods. These increments of time are appropriate for operational reporting, such as daily sales or weekly invoicing.

### Column definitions that include budgets

Budgets can be included on any report when included on the column definition. By selecting a ledger entry type of **Budget Entries**, and entering the **Budget Name** for the selected budget, you can easily show comparisons of actual to budget in reports.

# Reconcile vendor payments with the payment journal or from vendor ledger entries
When you send a payment or receive a refund from a vendor, you must decide whether to apply the payment or refund to one or more open entries. You can specify the exact amount that you want to apply to the payment receipt or refund, and then only partially apply vendor ledger entries. You must apply all vendor ledger entries to obtain correct vendor statistics and reports of the account statements and finance charges.

> [!NOTE]  
>   Vendors may sometimes give a payment refund instead of a credit memo to offset against future invoices, especially when you return items that you have already paid for or when you have overpaid an invoice.

You can apply vendor ledger entries in three different ways:

* By entering information in dedicated pages, such as the **Payment Journals** page and the **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page.
* From purchase credit memo documents.
* From vendor ledger entries after purchase documents are posted but not applied.

> [!NOTE]  
>   If the **Application Method** field on the vendor card contains **Apply to Oldest**, then payments will automatically be applied to the oldest open credit entry if you do not manually specify which entry to apply to. If the application method for a customer is **Manual**, then you must apply entries manually.

You can apply vendor payments manually to their related purchase documents when you post the payments on the **Payment Journals** page. For information about filling the payment journal, see [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).

You can also apply vendor payments, and customer payments, after the payments appear as negative bank transactions in your bank. On the **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page, you can use functions for bank statement import, automatic application, and bank account reconciliation. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).

## To apply a payment to a single or multiple vendor ledger entries
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Payment Journals** page, on the first journal line, enter the relevant information about the payment entry.
3. To apply a single vendor ledger entry:
   1. In the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field, choose the field to open the **Apply Vendor Entries** page.
   2. On the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, select the entry to apply the payment to.
   3. On the line in the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount to apply to the entry.
4. Or, to apply multiple vendor ledger entries:

   1. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
   2. On the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, select the lines with the entries to apply the payment to.
   3. Choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action.  
   4. On each line in the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount to apply to the individual entry.

      If you don't enter an amount, then the maximum amount is automatically applied. At the bottom of the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, you can see the amount in the Applied Amount field, and you can see whether the application balances.
5. Choose the **OK** button.
6. Choose the **Post** action to post the payment journal.

## To apply a credit memo to a single or multiple vendor ledger entries
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the credit memo that you want to apply.
3. Enter the relevant information in the header.
4. To apply a single vendor ledger entry, on the **Application** FastTab, in the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field, select the entry to apply the credit to, and then, in the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount to apply to the entry.
5. Or, to apply multiple vendor ledger entries:

   1. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
   2. Select the lines with the entries to apply the credit memo to.
   3. Choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action.  
   4. On each line in the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount to apply to the individual entry.

       If you don't enter an amount, then the maximum amount is automatically applied. At the bottom of the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, you can see the amount in the **Applied Amount** field, and you can see whether the application balances.
6. Choose the **OK** button.  
   The **Purchase Credit Memos** page shows the entry that you have selected in the **Applies-to Doc. Type** field and the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field. The page also shows the amount of the credit memo to be posted, adjusted for any payment discounts.
7. Choose the **Post** button to post the purchase credit memo.

## To apply posted vendor ledger entries
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant vendor with entries that have already been posted.
3. Choose the **Ledger Entries** action, and then choose the **Apply Entries** action.
4. On the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, you can see the open entries for the vendor.
5. Select the line with the entry that will be applied.
6. Choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action.

    The **Applies-to ID** field displays three asterisks if you work in a single-user system or your user ID if you work in a multiuser system.  
7. For each line in the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount to apply to the individual entry.

    If you don't enter an amount, then the maximum amount is automatically applied. You can see the amount in the **Applied Amount** field at the bottom of the **Apply Vendor Entries** page.
8. Choose the **Post Application** action.  

    The **Post Application** page opens with the document number of the applying entry and the posting date of the entry with the most recent posting date.
9. Choose the **OK** button to post the application.

## To apply vendor ledger entries in different currencies to one another
If you buy from a vendor in one currency and make payment in another currency, you can still apply the invoice to the payment.

If you apply an entry (Entry 1) in one currency to an entry (Entry 2) in a different currency, the posting date on Entry 1 is used to find the relevant exchange rate to convert amounts on Entry 2. The relevant exchange rate is found on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page. In that case, you must enable application of vendor ledger entries in different currencies. For more information, see [Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies](finance-how-enable-application-ledger-entries-different-currencies.md)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the journal you want, and fill in the first empty journal line using a currency code.
3. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
4. Select the line with the entry you want to apply to the entry in the payment journal, choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action, and then select the entry you want to apply to.
5. Choose the **OK** button to return to the payment journal.
6. Post the payment journal.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   When you apply entries in different currencies to one another, the entries are converted to USD. Even though the exchange rates for the two relevant currencies are fixed, for example between USD and EUR, there may be a small residual amount when these foreign-currency amounts are converted to USD. These small residual amounts are posted as gains and losses to the account specified in the **Realized Gains Account** or **Realized Losses Account** field on the **Currencies** page. The **Amount (USD)** field is also adjusted on the relevant vendor ledger entries.

## To unapply an application of vendor entries
When you unapply an erroneous application, correcting entries that are identical to the original entry but with opposite sign in the amount field is created and posted for all entries, including all general ledger posting derived from the application, such as payment discount and currency gains/losses. The entries that were closed by the application are reopened.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant vendor card.
3. Choose the **Ledger Entries** action.
4. Select the relevant ledger entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
5. Alternatively, choose the **Detailed Ledger Entry** action.
6. Select the application entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
7. Fill in the fields in the header, and then choose the **Unapply** action.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   If an entry has been applied by more than one application entry, you must unapply the latest application entry first.

# Reverse journal postings and undo receipts/shipments

Reverse journal postings are useful, for example, for correcting errors and for clearing out an old accruals entry before entering a new one. A reverse entry is the same as the original entry, but has an opposite sign in the **Amount** field. The reverse entry must have the same document number and posting date as the original entry. After you reverse an entry, you must make the correct entry.

You can only reverse entries that are posted from a general journal line. An entry can only be reversed one time.

To undo a receipt or shipment posting, before they're posted as invoiced, you can use the **Undo** function on the posted document. You can undo quantities of type **Item** and **Resource**.

If you posted an incorrect negative quantity, such as a purchase order with the wrong number of items, as received but not invoiced, you can undo the posting.

If you posted an incorrect positive quantity as shipped but not invoiced, you can undo the posting. For example, if you posted a sales shipment or a purchase return shipment with the wrong number of items.

> [NOTE!]
> Due to how [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] posts and updates amounts in an additional reporting currency (ACY), you can't use this feature if you use ACY. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] converts amounts in local currency to the alternate currency, but doesn't net transactions. If you use ACY, you must manually reverse the amounts.

## To reverse the journal posting of a general ledger entry

You can reverse entries from all **Ledger Entries** pages. The following procedure is based on the **General Ledger Entries** page.

> [!NOTE]
> The entry must originate from a journal posting.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Entries**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the entry that you want to reverse, and then choose the **Reverse Transaction** action.
3. On the **Reverse Transaction Entries** page, choose the **Reverse** action.
4. Choose **Yes** to confirm the reversal.

## To post a negative entry  

Use the **Correction** field to post a negative debit instead of a credit, or to post a negative credit instead of a debit on an account. By default, the field is available in all journals. The **Debit Amount** and **Credit Amount** fields include both the original entry, and the corrected entry. These fields have no effect on the account balance.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link  
2. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required batch name.  
3. Enter information into the relevant fields.  
4. In the journal line that you want to activate for negative entries, select the **Correction** check box.  
5. To post the journal, choose the **Post** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.

## To undo a quantity on a posted purchase receipt  

The following steps describe how to undo a posted receipt of items or resources. The steps are similar for posted shipments.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the posted receipt that you want to undo.  
3. Select the line or lines that you want to undo.  
4. Choose **Undo Receipt** action.

A corrective line is added under the selected receipt line. If the quantity was received in a warehouse receipt, then a corrective line is added on the posted warehouse receipt.  

The **Quantity Received** and **Qty. Rcd. Not Invoiced** fields on the related purchase order are set to zero.

## To undo and then redo a quantity on a posted return shipment

The following steps describe how to:

* Undo a posted return shipment of items or resources.
* Repost the purchase return with a new quantity.

The steps are similar for posted return receipts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Return Shipments**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the posted return shipment to undo.
3. Select the line or lines to undo.  

4. Choose the **Undo Return Shipment** action.  

    A corrective line is inserted in the posted document, and the **Return Qty. Shipped** and **Return Shpd. Not Invd.** fields on the return order are set to zero.  

    Now go back to the purchase return order and redo the posting.  

5. On the **Posted Return Shipment** page, take a note of the number in the **Return Order No.** field.  
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Return Orders**, and then select the related link.  
7. Open the return order in question, and then choose the **Reopen** action.  
8. Correct the entry in the **Quantity** field and post the purchase return order again.  

[!INCLUDE [rev-general-journal](includes/rev-general-journal.md)]

## Reverse a customer and vendor ledger entry with a realized gain or loss entry

You can use the **Reverse transaction** action to reverse payments that were applied to entries that originated in foreign currencies and were adjusted using the Exchange Rate Adjustment batch job. The feature works for both purchases and sales.

The following steps are a simple scenario that illustrates how it works:

1. Post a sales invoice for a customer using a foreign currency.
2. Adjust the exchange rate for that currency.
3. Post a payment applied to the invoice.
4. Unapply and reverse the payment transaction, for example, from the **Customer Ledger Entries** page.

When a location is set up to require warehouse pick processing and warehouse shipment processing, use warehouse pick documents to create and process pick information before you post the warehouse shipment.  

You can't create a warehouse pick document from scratch. Picks are part of a workflow where the person processing an order creates them in a push fashion, or the warehouse employee creates them in a pull fashion:

- In a push fashion, where you use the **Create Pick** action in the **Warehouse Shipment** page. Select the lines to be picked and prepare the picks by specifying, for example, which bins to take from and place in, and how many units to handle. Bins can be predefined for the warehouse location or resource.
- In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action in the **Warehouse Shipment** page to make the items available for picking. Then, on the **Pick Worksheet** page, warehouse employees can use the **Get Warehouse Documents** action to pull their assigned picks.

> [!NOTE]  
> Picking for a warehouse shipment of items that are assembled for a sales order follows the same steps as for regular warehouse picks for shipments, as described in this article. However, the number of pick lines for the quantity to ship may be many to one because you pick the components, not the assembled item.  
>
> Warehouse pick lines are created for the value in the **Remaining Quantity** field on the lines of the assembly order that's linked to the sales order line being shipped. All components are picked in one action. Learn more at [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items in Warehouse Shipments](warehouse-how-ship-items.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-in-warehouse-shipments).  
>  
> To learn more about picking components for assembly orders, including situations where assembly items aren't related to a sales shipment, go to [Pick for Production, Assembly, or Jobs in Advanced Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-internal-operations-in-advanced-warehousing.md).  

## Check whether items are available for picking

[!INCLUDE [inventory-availability-overview](includes/inventory-availability-overview.md)]

## To create pick documents in bulk with the pick worksheet

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Pick Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Choose the **Get Warehouse Documents** action.  

    The list will include all shipments that have been released for picking, including those for which pick instructions have already been created. Documents with pick lines that have been completely picked and registered are not shown in this list.  
3. Select the shipments for which you want to prepare a pick.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you try to select a shipment or internal pick document for which you've already created instructions for all of its lines you'll get a message that says something like, "there is nothing to handle." To combine warehouse pick instructions that you've already created into one pick instruction, you must delete the individual warehouse picks first.

4. Fill in the **Sorting Method** field to sort the lines.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The way the lines are sorted in the worksheet doesn't automatically carry through to the pick instruction. However, the same sorting and bin ranking opportunities exist. You can easily recreate the line order you plan in the worksheet when you create the pick instructions or sort in the pick instructions.

5. Fill in the **Qty. to Handle** field either manually, or by using the **Autofill Qty.to Handle** action.  

    The page shows the quantities available in cross-docking bins. This information is useful for planning work assignments in cross-docking situations. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will always propose a pick from a cross-dock bin first.
6. If needed, edit the lines. You can also delete lines to make the pick more efficient. For example, if there are multiple lines with items that are in cross-dock bins, you might create a pick for all of the lines. The cross-docked items will be shipped with the other items on the shipment, and the cross-dock bins will have space for more incoming items.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you delete lines, they're only deleted from the worksheet. They aren't deleted from the pick selection list.  

7. Choose the **Create Pick** action. The **Create Pick** page opens, where you can add more information to the pick you are creating. Specify how to combine pick lines in the pick documents by selecting one of the following options.  

    |Option|Description|
    |-|-|
    |Per Whse. Document|Creates separate pick documents for worksheet lines with the same warehouse source document.|
    |Per Cust./Vend./Loc.|Create separate pick documents for each customer (sale orders), vendor (purchase return orders), and location (transfer orders).|
    |Per Item|Create separate pick documents for each item on the pick worksheet.|
    |Per From Zone|Create separate pick documents for each zone that you'll take items from.|
    |Per Bin|Create separate pick documents for each bin that you'll take items from.|
    |Per Due Date|Create separate pick documents for source documents that have the same due date.|

    Specify how the pick documents are created by selecting from the following options.

    |Option|Description|
    |-|-|
    |Max. No. of Pick Lines|Creates pick documents that have no more than the specified number of lines in each document.|
    |Max. No. of Pick Source Docs.|Creates pick documents that each cover no more than the specified number of source documents.|
    |Assigned User ID|Creates pick documents only for worksheet lines that are assigned to the selected warehouse employee.|
    |Sorting Method for Pick Lines|Select from the available options to sort lines in the created pick document.|
    |Set Breakbulk Filter|Hides intermediate breakbulk pick lines when a larger unit of measure is converted to a smaller unit of measure and completely picked.|
    |Do Not Fill Qty. to Handle|Leaves the Qty. to Handle field in the created pick lines empty.|
    |Print Pick|Prints the pick documents when they are created. You can also print from the created pick documents.|

8. Choose **OK**. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will create the pick according to your selections.  

## To pick items for a warehouse shipment

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Picks**, and then choose the related link.  

    If you need to work on a particular pick, select the pick from the list or filter the list to find the picks that have been assigned to you specifically. Open the pick card.  
2. If the **Assigned User ID** field is empty, enter your ID to identify yourself if needed.  
3. Pick the items.  

    If the warehouse is set up to use bins, the items’ default bins are used to suggest where to take the items from. The instructions contain at least two separate lines for Take and Place actions.  

    If the warehouse is set up to use directed put-away and pick, bin ranking is used to calculate the best bins to pick from. Those bins are suggested on the pick lines. The instructions contain at least two separate lines for Take and Place actions.  

    * The first line, with **Take** in the **Action Type** field, indicates where the items are located in the picking area. If you're shipping a large number of items on one shipment line, you might have to pick the items in several bins, so there's a Take line for each bin.
    * The next line, with **Place** in the **Action Type** field, shows where you must place the items in the warehouse. You can't change the zone and bin on this line.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you must pick or place the items for one line in more than one bin, for example because the designated bin is full, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.
        
    You can sort the pick lines by various criteria, for example, by item, shelf number, or due date. Sorting can help optimize the put-away process, for example:

    * If the Take and Place lines for each shipment line don't immediately follow one another, and you want them to, sort the lines by selecting **Item** in the **Sorting Method** field.  
    * If bin rankings reflect the physical layout of the warehouse, use the **Bin Ranking** sorting method to organize the work by bin locations.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > Lines are sorted in ascending order by the selected criteria. If you sort by document, sorting is done first by document type based on the **Warehouse Activity Source Document** field. If you sort by ship-to, sorting is done first by destination type based on the **Warehouse Destination Type** field.

4. After you pick and place the items in the shipping area or shipping bin, choose the **Register Pick** action.  

You can now bring the items to the shipment dock and post the shipment, including the related source document, on the **Warehouse Shipment** page. Learn more at [Ship Items](warehouse-how-ship-items.md).

# Service Posting
Service posting functionality lets you process your documents efficiently and maintain successful customer service policy. You can create and update posted documents, and create ledger entries both in the service area and in other modules to ensure the correct update.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The following describes service posting regardless of how items are physically handled in the warehouse.  
>   
>  In a location that is not set up to require warehouse handling, you perform the posting actions directly from the **Service Lines** page. In locations that involve warehouse handling, the described posting actions, except Ship and Consume, are performed indirectly through varying warehouse ship functions, depending on setup. For more information, see [Pick Items with Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md).  

## Ship  
The ship option lets you register the relevant items and time entered on the lines of a service order after you complete the service. A posted shipment is created and updates occur in the Inventory module and other modules in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to reflect that the items have been taken out of the inventory and sent to the customer. In particular, the item ledger entries, value ledger entries, service ledger entries, and warranty ledger entries are produced.  

If the location is set up to require warehouse handling, then the shipping and moving of service line items functions in the same ways as for other source documents. The only difference is that service line items can be consumed either externally or internally, which requires two different release functions.

## Invoice  
You have to use the invoice option to issue an invoice to the customer you want to charge for the service. Usually, it is the difference between the shipped quantity registered by the **Post Shipment** function and the consumed quantity registered by the **Post Consumption** function that is subject to invoice. You cannot invoice what has not been shipped. When you run the **Post Invoice** function, you create a posted service invoice and update the documents posted before to make them consistent with the quantities that are contained in the issued invoice. Like in other posting procedures, the relevant ledger entries that includes general ledger entries, are generated.  

## Ship and Invoice  
The ship and invoice option lets you issue both a service shipment and an invoice at the same time.  

## Ship and Consume  
With the ship and consume option, you can register and post items, costs, or hours that have been used for servicing but that cannot be included in the invoice to the customer. An invoice is not issued, but you can issue both a service shipment and service consumption at the same time to reflect the fact that some items or hours have been given to the customer free of charge. The corresponding ledger entries are also created to register consumption.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The service posting procedure enables you to perform partial posting. You can create a partial shipment or a partial invoice by filling in the **Qty. to Ship** and **Qty. to Invoice** fields on the individual service lines of the service orders before you post. Note that you cannot create an invoice for something that is not shipped. That is, before you can invoice, you must have registered a shipment, or you must choose to ship and invoice at the same time.  

After the posting has been completed, you will be able to view the posted service documents from the corresponding **Posted Service Shipment** and **Posted Service Invoice** pages. The posted entries created can be seen in various pages that contain posted entries, such as **G/L Entries**, **Item Ledger Entries**, **Warehouse Entries**, **Service Ledger Entries**, **Project Ledger Entries**, and **Warranty Ledger Entries**.  

## To view information about a posted service document  
When you post a service invoice, a service shipment, or a service credit memo, the information on the document is transferred to the **Posted Service Invoice**, **Posted Service Shipment**, or **Posted Service Credit Memo** pages respectively. You cannot enter, change, or delete anything in these pages. You can print a shipment, invoice, or credit memo from these pages.  

The following procedure uses a posted service invoice as an example, but the same procedure can apply to posted service shipments and posted credit memos.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Service Invoice**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the posted service invoice you want to view.  
3. To get an overview of the posted invoice, choose the **Statistics** action.  

    The **Service Order Statistics** page opens. The page displays information such as quantity, amount, VAT, cost, profit, and customer credit limit for the posted document.

# About calculating standard cost

Many manufacturing companies select a valuation base of standard cost. This choice also applies to companies that do light manufacturing, such as assembly and kitting. A standard cost system determines inventory unit cost based on some reasonable historical or expected cost. Studies of past and estimated future cost data can provide the basis for standard costs. These costs are frozen until a decision is made to change them. The actual cost to produce a product can differ from the estimated standard costs. For management control, the actual cost is compared to the standard cost for a specific item and differences, or *variances*, are identified and analyzed.  

Standard costs can be maintained for items that are replenished through purchase, assembly, and production. For each replenishment method, standard costs can consist of the elements listed in the following table.  

|Replenishment system|Standard cost elements|  
|--------------------------|----------------------------|  
|**Purchase**|Direct material cost and overhead material cost if necessary.|  
|**Assembly**|Direct material cost, direct or fixed labor cost, and overhead cost.|  
|**Prod. Order**|Direct material cost, material noninventory cost, labor cost, subcontractor cost, and overhead cost.|  

## Set up standard costs

Because the standard cost of a produced or assembled item can consist of multiple cost elements, including material, capacity (labor) and direct and overhead subcontractor costs, you must establish standard costs for each of these elements.  

The accounting tasks for an item-processing company using standard costing are to:  

- Estimate a standard cost of the finished item and set it up on the item card.  
- Record and allocate the actual cost of the key cost elements and to account for variances.  

To determine the direct cost of a finished item, total all component costs. An assembled or produced item can include subassemblies that also consist of multiple components.  

The following key cost elements make up the total direct cost of a finished processed item:  

- Material costs.  
- Capacity cost.  
- Subcontracting costs for produced items only.  

### Material costs

Material costs are costs that are associated with subassemblies and purchased raw material. Material unit cost can consist of direct and indirect cost elements.  

- Direct material cost represents an invoiced amount for purchased raw materials or the processing cost of a subassembly.  
- Indirect material cost, or *overhead*, can represent elements such as inventory carrying costs for the finished item.  

The setup of the material cost for purchased items that affect direct and indirect cost depends on the costing method that you selected for the specified item. You set up cost information for either costing method on the item card. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

The cost of scrap (production only) is another factor to consider when you calculate the total material cost. Scrapping raw materials when you assemble or produce an item often causes an increase in the quantity of components that are required to produce the item. In turn, this increases the material cost of the components that you consume when you produce a parent item. You set up scrap cost for materials on either the production BOM or routing.  

The material cost of a produced item can be represented in two ways that correspond to the following cost calculation bases.  

|Cost Calculation Basis|Material Cost Calculation|  
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|  
|Single level|The produced item is equal to the total cost of all purchased or subassembled items on that item's production BOM.|  
|Rolled-up level or multilevel|The produced item is the sum of:<br /><br />* The material cost for all subassemblies on the item's BOM. <br />* The cost of all purchased items on the item's production BOM.|  

### Capacity costs

Capacity costs are the costs that are associated with internal labor and machine costs. You must set up these costs for each resource (in assembly management) and work or machine center on the routing (in production). As with materials, you can identify both direct and indirect elements of capacity cost. For example, the direct cost for a work center can be the established shop rate to perform a specific function. The indirect cost for a work center can represent some general factory expenses, such as lighting, heating, and so on. As with material costs, you can express capacity overhead as an indirect cost percentage or a fixed overhead rate.  

The setup of the capacity costs of assembled items consists of the following elements:  

- Direct and indirect unit cost of the resource.  
- Fixed or direct resource usage type.  

The setup of the capacity costs of produced items consists of the following elements:  

- Direct and indirect unit cost of the machine or work center.  
- Time and lot size setup.  

To calculate standard capacity cost, you have to establish the standard time rates that are required to perform operations on machine and work centers. The total time to complete an operation typically consists of setup, run time, and wait and move time.  

You set up the rates for each time type for each machine or work center on an individual routing.  

> [!NOTE]  
> While run time rates apply for each item unit that is produced, the setup time rates apply for each lot. Therefore, you must prorate the routing setup time for each operation over the lot size. You specify the lot size in the corresponding field on the **Replenishment** FastTab of the **Item Card** page.  

To specify setup time on the routing for planning but exclude this expense in the standard cost calculation, clear the **Cost Incl. Setup** field on the **Manufacturing Setup** page.  

On a single-level basis, this value is the labor cost that is required to produce the finished production item and is specified on the production item's routing. On a multi-level basis, this value is the capacity cost that is specified for each individually produced item that is included in the parent item's BOM.  

### Subcontractor costs

Subcontractor costs are the costs that are associated with services that are provided by a company's outside vendors or subcontractors. Similar to material and capacity, subcontractor costs can consist of both direct and overhead amounts. Direct subcontractor cost represents the actual charge for each unit of services that is provided. For example, overhead subcontractor cost can represent freight and handling costs that the company incurs with a subcontracted order.  

Because subcontracting is an outsourced capacity, you set up the cost of both direct and indirect subcontracting services on the work center card that represents the subcontracting operation.  

## Populate standard cost

You can set standard cost manually or you can calculate the item's standard cost from the **Item card** page. Choose the **Production** group, then choose the **Calc. Production Std Cost** action to update cost of production items or choose the **Assembly** group, then choose the **Calc. Assembly Std. Cost** action to update cost of assembly item. The actions consolidate and roll up the component and capacity costs to calculate the total assembly or manufacturing cost of the items.

To calculate the unit cost of an assembly or production BOM, the parent item and its component items must use the Standard costing method. Resources in the BOM roll-up if they have a unit cost defined on the item, resource, or workcenter. Resources don't use cost defined on stockkeeping unit (SKU).

You can define a production BOM or routing in the SKU, which can be useful if the SKU represents a variant that requires a different set of components or different location. For example, where different production equipment is available. These changes might affect standard cost. You can use the **Calc. Production Std. Cost** action on the **Stockkeeping Unit Card** page to calculate standard cost. Subassemblies use information from items, and not the cost defined on stockkeeping unit. To enable this feature, go to the **Manufacturing Setup** page and turn on the **Load SKU Cost on Manufacturing** toggle.

If you have open entries, after you make a change in the **Standard Cost** field on the item, remember to revaluate inventory. To learn more, go to [Revalue Inventory](inventory-how-revalue-inventory.md).

## Updating standard costs with the Standard Cost Worksheet

The **Standard Cost Worksheet** is intended as a tool for purchasers, production or assembly managers, and internal controllers when they have to review and update standard costs.

Use the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page to do the following:

- Prepare the changes in advance of the date when they have to take effect.
- Simulate the effect on the cost of the manufactured or assembled item if the standard cost for consumption, production capacity usage, or assembly resource usage is changed.
- Execute the changes at a given date and let them take effect immediately.

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel](includes/edit-in-excel.md)]

Purchasers use the [**Suggest Item Standard Cost**](#suggest-item-standard-cost) batch job to update and work with the costs of purchased items in one worksheet. When the result is satisfactory, the worksheet is given to the internal controller.

Production or assembly managers use the [**Suggest Work/Mach Ctr Std Cost**](#suggest-workmach-ctr-std-cost) batch job to update and work with the production capacity costs and assembly resource costs of processed items in another worksheet. This worksheet is also given to the internal controller.

Internal controllers use the [**Copy Standard Cost Worksheet**](#copy-standard-cost-worksheet) batch job to consolidate the worksheets into one worksheet. Use the [**Roll Up Standard Cost**](#roll-up-standard-cost) batch job to make a roll-up of the costs from the purchaser and the production or assembly manager. The roll-up determines the standard costs of manufactured and assembled items. Controllers can preview cost changes before and after the roll-up to identify unacceptable deviations. When the updates are acceptable, the controller implements the changes to take effect on a given date.

Use the [**Implement Standard Cost Change**](#implement-standard-cost-change) batch job to implement the standard cost changes. The batch job updates the standard costs of the items that are included in the worksheet. It also creates revaluation journal lines so that you can update the items in stock with the new standard cost.

> [!NOTE]
> Standard cost worksheets don't support stockkeeping units.

### To update standard costs

1. Run the **Adjust Cost-Item Entries** batch job. To start the batch job, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Adjust Cost-Item Entries**, and then choose the related link. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
2. Run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job. To start the batch job, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**, and then choose the related link. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Standard Cost Worksheet**, and then use one or more of the following actions:
    1. Run the **Suggest Item Standard Cost** batch job.  
    2. Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
    3. Run the **Suggest Capacity Standard Cost** batch job.  
    4. Review the results and make changes as necessary.
    5. Run the **Roll Up Standard Cost** batch job.
    6. Review the results and make changes as necessary.
    7. Run the **Implement Standard Cost Changes** batch job.  
4. Review and post the **Revaluation Journal** page, which was populated with entries from the previous steps in this process.  

### Suggest item standard cost

Creates suggestions for changing the costs and cost shares of standard costs on item cards. When the batch job completes, the results are available in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

> [!NOTE]  
> This batch job is intended for purchased items only. If you want to update an item with a production BOM or assembly BOM, then you must first fill in the worksheet with all the components and then run the **Roll Up Standard Cost** batch job.

This batch job only creates suggestions. It doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them,  then select **Implement Standard Cost Changes** in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

#### Options

**Standard Cost**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the standard cost. You can also select a rounding method for the new standard cost. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

**Indirect Cost %**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the indirect cost %. You can also select a rounding method for the new indirect cost %. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

**Overhead Rate**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the overhead rate. You can also select a rounding method for the new overhead rate. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

### Suggest Work/Mach Ctr Std Cost

Creates suggestions for changing the costs and cost shares of standard costs on work center, machine center, or resource cards. When the batch job completes, the results are available on the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

This batch job only creates suggestions. It doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them,  then select **Implement Standard Cost Changes** in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

After you run the batch job and want to review the effect on your production or assembly departments, run the **Roll Up Standard Cost** batch job to update standard costs on:

- Work centers
- Machine centers
- Assembly resources
- Production BOMs
- Assembly BOMs

#### Options

**Standard Cost**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the standard cost. You can also select a rounding method for the new standard cost. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

**Indirect Cost %**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the indirect cost %. You can also select a rounding method for the new indirect cost %. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

**Overhead Rate**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the overhead rate. You can also select a rounding method for the new overhead rate. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

### Copy Standard Cost Worksheet

Copies standard cost worksheets from several sources into the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

You can only copy one worksheet at a time. The lines from the copied worksheets are placed below each other in the consolidated worksheet. Item lines are listed first, then work/machine center lines are listed, and resource lines are listed last.

### Roll up standard cost

Rolls up the standard costs of assembled and manufactured items. These values are influenced by the change in standard costs of components suggested by the **Suggest Item Standard Cost** batch job. In addition, they're influenced by the change in standard cost of production capacity and assembly resources suggested by the **Suggest Work/Mach Ctr Std Cost** batch job.

After you run either or both of these batch jobs and you do the roll-up, changes to the standard costs in the worksheet apply to the related production or assembly BOMs. The costs are applied at each BOM level.

> [!NOTE] 
> This function only rolls up the standard cost on the item cards, not on the SKU cards.

This batch job only creates suggestions. It doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them, then you can use the **Implement Standard Cost Change** batch job. 

#### Options

**Calculation Date**: Enter the date that applies to the production BOM version you want to do the roll-up for.
 
### Implement standard cost change

Updates the changes in the standard cost in the **Item** table with the ones in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page. The standard cost change suggestions can be created with the **Suggest Item Standard Cost** and/or the **Suggest Work/Mach Ctr Std Cost** batch job, and they can also be modified. The contents of all the fields in the standard cost change suggestions are transferred. When you implement suggestions of changes to standard costs, you can see them on the item card and/or on the work/machine center cards. A revaluation journal is also created for you to update the value of existing stock.

#### Options

**Posting Date**: Enter the date that the revaluation should take place.

**Document No.**: Enter the number of the revaluation journal lines. If there's a number series set up on the item journal batch name, the document number follows the ledger entries made by the posting of the revaluation journal. Otherwise, you can manually enter a number.

**Item Journal Template**: Enter the name of the revaluation journal template.

**Item Journal Batch Name**: Enter the name of the actual revaluation journal

Select **OK** to start the batch job. If you don't want to run the batch job now, select **Cancel** to close the window.

Review and post the **Revaluation Journal** page, which was populated with entries from the previous steps in this process.

# Count, adjust, and reclassify inventory using journals

To ensure that your quantities are correct, physically count all of the items in your inventory. Some businesses do an annual physical count, and others count all or only some items more often. After you count items, use journals to post the actual quantities to the general ledger. For example, when you valuate inventory at the end of a period.

To count some items more often than others, perhaps because of their value, use cycle counts. For cycle counts, assign special counting periods to the items. Learn more at [To do cycle counting](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-do-cycle-counting).

To adjust quantities after a physical count or other purposes, use an item journal to change the inventory ledger entries without posting transactions. You can also adjust the quantity for a single item on an item card.

To change attributes on item ledger entries, use an item reclassification journal. Typical attributes to reclassify include dimensions and sales campaign codes. You can also use reclassification journals for transfers by reclassifying bin and location codes. Special steps apply when you want to reclassify serial or lot numbers and their expiration dates. Learn more at [Work with Serial and Lot Numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md).

> [!NOTE]
> In multi-step processes, items are registered in bins as warehouse entries, not as item ledger entries. Therefore, you do counting, adjusting, and reclassifying in warehouse journals that support bins. Then you synchronize the new or changed warehouse entries with their related item ledger entries to reflect the changes in inventory quantities and values.

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel](includes/edit-in-excel.md)]

## To count physical inventory

To check whether the quantity registered is the same as the physical quantity in stock, count your physical inventory. That is, count the actual items on hand. Typically, counts happen at the end of a fiscal year, but some businesses count items more often. If there are differences, post the actual quantities to the item accounts before you do inventory valuation.

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure describes how to do a physical inventory using a journal on the **Phys. Inventory Journal** page. You can use documents on the **Physical Inventory Order** and **Physical Inventory Recording** pages. These documents offer more control and support for distributing the counting work to multiple employees. Learn more at [Count Inventory Using Documents](inventory-how-count-inventory-with-documents.md).
>
> Note that you can't use the document-based functionality to count items in bins or warehouse entries.

The counting process also involves the following tasks:

- Calculate the expected inventory.
- Print the report you want to use for the count.
- Enter and post the actual quantities.

Depending on your warehouse setup, count physical inventory in one of the following ways. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

- If your location doesn't use directed put-away and pick, use the **Phys. Inventory Journal** page. The procedure is similar to physical inventory without cycle counting.  
- If your location uses directed put-away and picks, use the **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal** page. Then use the **Item Journals** page to run the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** action. <!--We should say what to do on each of these pages.-->

### To calculate expected inventory in basic warehouse configurations

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Calculate Inventory** action from **Prepare**.
3. On the **Calculate Inventory** page, specify the conditions to use to create the journal lines, such as whether to include items that have zero recorded inventory.
4. Set filters if you only want to calculate inventory for certain items, bins, locations, or dimensions.
5. Choose the **OK** button.

> [!NOTE]  
> Item entries are processed according to the information that you specified, and lines are created in the physical inventory journal. Notice that the **Qty. (Phys. Inventory)** field has the same quantity as the **Qty. (Calculated)** field. You don't need to enter the counted quantity for items where these values match. However, if the quantity counted differs, enter the quantity that was counted.

### To print the report to be used when counting

1. On the **Physical Inventory Journals** page containing the calculated expected inventory, Choose the **Print** action from **Home**.
2. On the **Physical Inventory List** page, specify whether the report will show the calculated quantity and inventory items by serial and lot numbers.
3. Set filters if you only want to print the report for certain items, bins, locations, or dimensions.
4. Choose **Print**.

Warehouse employees can now count inventory and record any differences on the printed report.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take several days before printed reports come back for final processing and posting. When you specify and post actual counted inventory, the system adjusts inventory to reflect the difference between the expected and the actual counted inventory. You must keep the originally calculated journal lines and not recalculate the expected inventory, because the expected inventory may change and lead to incorrect inventory levels. If you need to issue multiple reports, such as for different locations or group of items, you must create and keep separate journal batches.

### To enter and post the actual counted inventory in basic warehouse configurations

1. On each line on the **Physical Inventory Journals** page where the actual inventory on hand, as determined by the physical count, differs from the calculated quantity, enter the actual inventory on hand in the **Qty. (Phys. Inventory)** field.
  
  > [!NOTE]  
  > If the physical count reveals differences caused by items posted with incorrect locations, don't enter the differences in the physical inventory journal. Instead, use a reclassification journal or a transfer order to redirect the items to the correct locations. 

2. To adjust the calculated quantities to the actual counted quantities, choose the **Post** action from **Home**.

    Posting creates item ledger entries and physical inventory ledger entries. Open the Item Card page for the item to find its physical inventory ledger entries.

3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
4. To verify the count, open the **Item Card** page for the item, and choose the **Phys. Inventory Ledger Entries** action from **Item**

### To calculate the expected inventory in advanced warehouse configurations

Synchronize item ledger and warehouse data before you count physical inventory. Otherwise, what you post to the physical inventory journal and item ledger is the physical inventory results combined with other warehouse adjustments for the items. Learn more at [Synchronize quantities in the item ledger and warehouse](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-synchronize-the-adjusted-warehouse-entries-with-the-related-item-ledger-entries).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Calculate Inventory** action to open the **Whse. Calculate Inventory** page.  
3. Set the filters to specify the items to count in the journal, and then choose **OK**.

   [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a line for each bin that meets the filter requirements. You can delete lines, but if you want to post the results as a physical inventory, count the item in all the bins that contain it.  

   If you only count an item in some bins but not others, you can enter differences and post them in the **Item Journal** page later by using the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** action.  

### To enter and post the actual counted inventory in advanced warehouse configurations

1. On the **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal** page, enter the actual quantities in the **Qty. (Phys. Inventory)** field.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **Qty. (Calculated)** field is filled in based on bin records. This quantity is copied to the **Qty. (Physical)** field on each line. If the quantities in these fields don't match, enter the actual quantity.  

2. After you enter all actual quantities, choose the **Register** action.  

    When you register the journal, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates two warehouse entries in the warehouse register for every line that was counted and registered:  

    - If the calculated and the actual quantities differ, a negative or positive quantity is registered for the bin, and a balancing quantity is posted to the location's adjustment bin.  
    - If the calculated quantity equals the physical quantity, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] registers **0** for both the bin and the adjustment bin.

When you register physical inventory, you don't post to the item, physical inventory, or the value ledgers. However, the records are available for reconciliation when needed. To keep quantities accurate, after you count items in all bins, post the results.<!--physical inventory journal--> Learn more at [Synchronize quantities in the item ledger and warehouse](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-synchronize-the-adjusted-warehouse-entries-with-the-related-item-ledger-entries).

## To do cycle counting

You can count items as often as you'd like. For example, because they're more valuable or top sellers. Specify the counting frequency by assigning special counting periods to the items.

Depending on your warehouse setup, you can do cycle counting in the following ways. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

- If your location doesn't use directed put-away and picks, use the **Physical Inventory Journal** page. The steps are similar to counting physical inventory without cycle counting.  
- If your location uses directed put-away and picks, use the **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal** page. Then use the **Item Journals** page to run the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** action.  

### To set up counting periods

Counting physical inventory is typically a recurring task, for example monthly, quarterly, or annually. You can set up the inventory counting periods you need and assign one to each item. Afterward, use the **Calculate Counting Period** action on the **Physical Inventory Journal** page to automatically create lines for the items.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Counting Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### To assign a counting period to an item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the item to which you want to assign a counting period.  
3. In the **Phys Invt Counting Period Code** field, select the counting period.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you're changing the counting period, a message displays information about the results of the change. Choose **Yes** to change the code and calculate the first counting period for the item. The next time you choose to calculate a counting period in the physical inventory journal, the item appears as a line on the **Phys. Invt. Item Selection** page. You can then count the item periodically.

### To start a count based on counting periods in basic warehouse configurations

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Calculate Counting Period** action.

    The **Phys. Invt. Item Selection** page shows items that need to be counted according to their counting periods.
3. Count the physical inventory. Learn more at [To count physical inventory](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-count-physical-inventory).

### To start a count based on counting periods in advanced warehouse configurations

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Calculate Counting Period** action.

    The **Phys. Invt. Item Selection** page show items need to be counted according to their counting periods.
3. Count the physical inventory. Learn more at [To count physical inventory](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-count-physical-inventory).  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > Count the item in all bins that contain it. If you delete bin lines that were retrieved for counting on the **Whse. Phys. Inventory** page, the count will be incorrect when you post it in a physical inventory journal.  

## To adjust the quantity of one item

After you do a physical count of an item, use the **Adjust Inventory** action to record the actual inventory quantity.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the item for which you want to adjust inventory, and then choose the **Adjust Inventory** action.
3. In the **New Inventory** field for the location, enter the result of the count.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

The item’s inventory is adjusted. The new quantity is shown in the **Quantity on Hand** field on the **Item Card** page.

You can also use the **Adjust Inventory** action as an easy way to add purchased items to inventory if you don't use purchase invoices or orders to record your purchases. Learn more at [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> After you adjust inventory, update its current value. Learn more at [Revalue Inventory](inventory-how-revalue-inventory.md).

### To adjust the quantities of multiple items in basic warehouse configurations

On the **Item Journals** page, you can post item transactions directly to adjust inventory for purchases, sales, and positive or negative changes without using documents.

If you often use the item journal to post the same or similar journal lines, for example, for material consumption, the **Standard Item Journal** page can make this recurring work easier. Learn more at [Work with Standard Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md#work-with-standard-journals).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Choose the **Post** action to adjust the quantities.

### To adjust bin quantities in advanced warehouse configurations

If your location uses directed put-away and picks, use the **Warehouse Item Journal** page to post unplanned positive and negative quantity changes. For example, for items posted as missing that show up unexpectedly, or losses due to breakage.  

Warehouse item journals give you more levels of adjustment to make your quantities more precise. The warehouse knows how many items are on hand and where they're stored, but each adjustment isn't posted to the item ledger. Credits or debits are made to the real bin with the quantity adjustment. A balancing entry is made in an adjustment bin. The adjustment bin is a virtual bin with no real items. You specify the virtual bin in the **Invt. Adjustment Bin Code** field on **Location Card** pages.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Item Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the header information.  
3. In the **Item No.** field on the line, choose the item.  
4. Enter the bin in which you're putting the extra items or where items are missing.  
5. In the **Quantity** field, if you find extra items, enter a positive quantity. If items are missing, enter a negative quantity.  
6. Choose the **Register** action.

## To synchronize the adjusted warehouse entries with the related item ledger entries

Post the adjustment bin records in the item ledger for the defined periods. Some companies post daily adjustments to the item ledger, while others reconcile less often.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields on each journal line.  
3. Choose the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** action, and then add filters on the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** page. Adjustments are calculated only for the entries in the adjustment bin that meet the filter requirements.  
4. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the **Document No.** field with a number. The number displays on the item journal lines.
5. Choose **OK**. The positive and negative adjustments are totaled for each item, and lines are created in the item journal.  
6. Post the journal lines to enter the quantity differences in the item ledger. The quantities in the bins and the item ledger now match.

# Design Details: Warehouse Setup

Warehouse functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contains different levels of complexity, as defined by license permissions in the offered granules. The level of complexity in a warehouse solution is largely defined by the bin setup on location cards, which in turn is license-controlled so that access to bin setup fields is defined by the license. In addition, the application objects in the license govern which UI document to use for the supported warehouse activities.  
<!--
The following warehouse-related granules exist:  

- Basic Inventory (4010)  
- Bin (4170)  
- Put Away (4180)  
- Warehouse Receipt (4190)  
- Pick (4200)  
- Warehouse Shipment (4210)  
- Warehouse Management Systems (4620)  
- Internal Picks and Put-aways (4630)  
- Automated Data Capture System (4640)
- Bin Setup (4660)  

For more information about each granule, see [[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Price Sheets](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238341) (requires PartnerSource account). -->

The following table shows which granules are required to define different warehouse complexity levels, which UI documents support each level, and which location codes reflect these levels in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] demonstration database.

## Bin and Bin Content

A bin is a storage device designed to contain discrete parts. It is the smallest container unit in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Item quantities in bins are referred to as bin content. A lookup from the **Item** field or **Bin Code** field on any warehouse-related document line displays the calculated availability of the item in the bin.  

A bin content can be given a property of Fixed, Dedicated, or Default to define how the bin content can be used. Bins with none of these properties are referred to as floating bins.  

A fixed bin holds items that are assigned to the bin code in question. The Fixed bin property ensures that even if the bin content is momentarily emptied, the bin content does not disappear, and the bin is therefore selected again as soon as it has been replenished.  

A dedicated bin holds bin content that can only be picked for the dedicated resource, such as a machine center, that uses the bin in question. Other non-pick content, such as quantities outbound on a shipment posting, can still be consumed from a dedicated bin. Only bin content considered by the **Create Pick** algorithm is protected in a dedicated bin.  

The Default bin property is used by the system to suggest bins for warehouse activities. At WMS locations, the Default bin property is not used. At locations where bins are required, the property is used in inbound flows to specify where to place items. In outbound flows, the property is used to specify where to take items from.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If the outbound items are placed in several bins, then items are first taken from the non-default bins, to empty that bin content, and then the remaining items are taken from the default bin.  

There can only be one default bin per item per location.  

## Bin Type

In WMS installations, you can restrict the warehouse activities that are allowed for a bin by assigning a bin type to it. The following bin types exist:  

|Bin Type|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|RECEIVE|Items posted as received but not yet put away.|  
|SHIP|Items picked for warehouse shipment lines but not yet posted as shipped.|  
|PUT AWAY|Typically, items to be stored in large units of measure but that you do not want to access for picking purposes. Because these bins are not used for picking, either for production orders or shipments, your use of a Put Away type bin might be limited, but this bin type could be useful if you have purchased a large quantity of items. Bins of this type should always have a low bin-ranking, so that when received items are put away, other higher-ranking PUTPICK bins fixed to the item are put away first. If you are using this type of bin, you must regularly perform bin replenishment so that the items stored in these bins are also available in PUTPICK or PICK type bins.|  
|PICK|Items to be used for picking only. The replenishment of these bins can only be made by movement, not by put-away.|  
|PUTPICK|Items in bins that are suggested for both the put-away and pick functions. Bins of this type probably have different bin rankings. You can set up your bulk storage bins as this type of bin with low bin rankings compared to your ordinary pick bins or forward picking area bins.|  
|QC|This bin is used for inventory adjustments if you specify this bin on the location card in the **Adjustment Bin Code** field. You can also set up bins of this type for defective items and items being inspected. You can move items to this type of bin if you want to make them inaccessible to the usual item flow. **Note:**  Unlike all other bin types, the **QC** bin type has none of the item handling check boxes selected by default. This indicates that any content you place in a QC bin is excluded from item flows.|  

For all bin types, except PICK, PUTPICK, and PUTAWAY, no other activity is allowed for the bin than what is defined by its bin type. For example, a bin of type **Receive** can only be used to receive items into or pick items from.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Only movement can be made to bins of type RECEIVE and QC. Similarly, only movements can be made from bins of type SHIP and QC.  

## Bin Ranking

In advanced warehousing, you can automate and optimize how items are collected in put-away and pick worksheets by ranking bins so that items are suggested taken or placed according to rank criteria to use warehouse space optimally.  

Put-away processes are optimized according to bin ranking by suggesting higher-ranking bins before lower-ranking bins. Similarly, pick processes are optimized by first suggesting items from bin content with high bin ranking. Furthermore, bin replenishments are suggested from lower-ranking bins to higher-ranking bins.  

Bin ranking together with bin content information are the basic properties that allow users to slot items in the warehouse.  

## Bin Setup  
In advanced warehousing, bins can be set up with capacity values, such as quantity, total cubage, and weight to control which and how items are stored in the bin.  

On each item card, you can assign a unit of measure (UOM) for the item, such as pieces, pallets, liters, grams, or boxes. You can also have a base UOM for an item and specify larger UOMs that are based on it. For example, you can define a pallet to equal 16 pieces, the latter being the base UOM.  

If you want to set a maximum quantity of a specific item to be stored in an individual bin and the item has more than one UOM, then you must set the maximum quantity for every UOM that exists on the item card. Accordingly, if an item has been set up to be handled in pieces and pallets, then the **Max. Qty.** field on the **Bin Content** page for that item must also be in pieces and pallets. Otherwise, the allowed quantity for that bin is not calculated correctly.  

Before you set capacity restrictions for bin contents on a bin, you must first make sure that the UOM and dimensions of the item have been set up on the item card.  

> [!NOTE]  
> It is only possible to operate with multiple UOMs in WMS installations. I all other configurations, bin contents can only be in the base UOM. In all transactions with a UOM higher than the item's base UOM, the quantity is converted to the base UOM.  

## Zone

In advanced warehousing, bins can be grouped in zones to manage how the workflow of warehouse activities is directed.  

A zone could be a receiving zone or a stocking zone, and each zone can consist of one or several bins.  

Most properties assigned to a zone will by default be assigned to the bin that is created from that zone.  

## Class  
In advanced warehousing, you can assign warehouse class codes to items, bins, and zones to control where different item classes are stored, such as frozen goods. You can divide a zone into several warehouse classes. For example, items in the receiving zone can be stored as frozen, hazardous, or other class.  

When you work with warehouse classes and a default receiving/shipping bin, you must manually fill in the appropriate bins in the warehouse receipt and shipment lines.  

In inbound flows, the class code is only highlighted on inbound lines where the item class code does not match the default receiving bin. If the correct default bins are not assigned, then the quantity cannot be received.  

## Location

A location is a physical structure or place where inventory is received, stored, and shipped, potentially organized in bins. A location can be a warehouse, service car, showroom, plant, or an area in a plant.  

## First Expired First Out

If you select the **Pick According to FEFO** check box on the **Bin Policies** FastTab on the location card, then item-tracked items are picked according to their expiration date. The items with the earliest expiration dates are picked first.  

Warehouse activities in all pick and movement documents are sorted according to FEFO, unless the items in question already have serial/lot numbers assigned. If only a part of the quantity on the line already has serial/lot numbers assigned, then the remaining quantity to be picked is sorted according to FEFO.  

When picking by FEFO, the available items that expire first are gathered in a temporary item tracking list based on the expiration date. If two items have the same expiration date, then the item with the lowest lot or serial number is picked first. If the lot or serial numbers are the same, then the item that was registered first is selected first. Standard criteria for selecting items in pick bins, such as Bin Ranking and Break Bulk, are applied to this temporary FEFO item tracking list.  

## Put-away Template

The put-away template can be assigned to an item and to a location. The put-away template specifies a set of prioritized rules that must be respected when creating put-aways. For example, a put-away template may require that the item is placed in a bin with bin content that matches the UOM, and if a similar bin with enough capacity cannot be found, then the item must be placed in an empty bin.

# Assemble Items

If the **Replenishment System** field on the item card contains **Assembly**, the default method of supplying the item is to assemble it according to an assembly BOM, and potentially by a specific resource. Learn more at [Work with Assembly BOMs](assembly-how-work-assembly-boms.md). Learn more about how to set up an assembly item at [Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md).

You can set up assembly items for two assembly processes.

|Process  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Assemble to stock     | Items that you assemble and stock for future sales. For example, kits for an upcoming sales campaign. The items aren't related to a sales order, at least not yet. Typically, these items aren't customized for customer requests.        |
|Assemble to order     | Items that you don't want to stock. For example, because they're customized based on customer orders or to reduce the cost of on-hand inventory. |
  
This article describes the standard settings for assemble to stock. There might be other ways that are more suited for your business though. Learn more at [Sell Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md) and [Sell Assemble-to-Order Items and Inventory Items Together](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> Assembly components are handled in a special way in basic warehouse configurations. Learn more at [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items with Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).

## To assemble an item to stock

Follow the steps in this procedure to assemble an item to stock. To learn about assemble to order, go to [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assembly Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. The **New Assembly Order** page opens.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. In the **Item No.** field, select the item that you want to assemble. You can select items that are set up for assembly and have an assembly BOM, or items without an assembly BOM. The latter is useful for unplanned assemblies or scenarios when you want to use item reclassification and track costs.  
5. In the **Quantity** field, enter how many units of the item that you want assembled.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If one or more components are not available to fulfill quantity on the due date, the **Assembly Availability** page opens. The page shows how many assembly items can be assembled based on component availability. Learn more at [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md). When you close the page, the assembly order is created with availability alerts on the lines for the affected components.  

    The lines contain the contents of the assembly BOM and the specified quantities.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the **Assembly Availability** page opened when you filled in the assembly order header, each affected assembly order line contains a **Yes** in the **Avail. Warning** field with a link to detailed availability information. <!--check whether this field help is useful For more information, see Check Availability.--> You can resolve a component availability issue by:

    > * Postponing the starting date.
    > * Replacing the component with another item.
    > * Selecting an available substitution if one is defined.  

6. In the **Quantity to Assemble** field, enter how many units of the assembly item that you want to post as output the next time you post the assembly order. This quantity can be lower than the value in the **Quantity** field to reflect a partial output posting.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  To make sure that component consumption posting matches the assembly item output posting, the quantity fields in the assembly order lines automatically adjust to the value that you enter in the **Quantity to Assemble** field.  
7. On assembly order lines of type **Item** or **Resource**, in the **Quantity to Consume** field, specify how many units you want to post as consumed the next time that you post the assembly order.
8. When you are ready to partially or fully post, choose the **Post** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If warnings are still present in the assembly order lines, you can't post the order. A message displays the component or components that are not in inventory.  

After posting succeeds, the assembly item is posted as output to the location code and potential bin code that are defined on the assembly order. For manually created assembly orders, the location may be copied from the **Default Location for Orders** setup field. For assemble-to-order flows, the location code may be copied from the sales order line.

# Design details: reservation, order tracking, and action messaging

The comprehensive reservation system includes the interrelated and parallel features of Order Tracking and Action Messaging.  

At the core of the reservation system, is the linking of a demand entry and a corresponding supply entry, either through reservation or order tracking. A reservation is a user-generated link, and an order tracking record is a system-generated link. An item quantity entered in the reservation system is either reserved or order tracked, but not both at the same time. How the systems handle an item depends on how the item is setup.  

The reservation system interacts with the planning system by creating action messages on planning lines during planning runs. An action message can be considered an appendage to an order tracking record. Action messages, whether created dynamically in order tracking or during the planning run, provide a convenient tool for efficient supply planning.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Reserved quantities are ignored by the planning system, that is, the hard link that is made between supply and demand cannot be changed through planning.  

 The reservations system also forms the structural foundation for the item tracking system. For more information, go to [Design Details: Item Tracking](design-details-item-tracking.md).  

 <!--For more detailed information about how the reservation system works, see the _Reservation Entry Table_ white paper on [PartnerSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=258348).  -->
<!--
> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [locations-cronus](includes/locations-cronus.md)]
-->

## Reservation  

 A reservation is a firm link that connects a specific demand and a specific supply to each other. This link directly affects the subsequent inventory transaction and ensures the proper application of item entries for costing purposes. A reservation overrides the default costing method of an item. For more information, go to [Design Details: Item Tracking](design-details-item-tracking.md).  

 The **Reservation** page is accessible from all order lines of both demand and supply types. On this page, the user can specify which demand or supply entry to create a reservation link towards. The reservation consists of a pair of records that share the same entry number. One record has a negative sign and points to the demand. The other record has a positive sign and points to the supply. These records are stored in the *Reservation Entry* table with the status value *Reservation*. The user can view all reservations on the **Reservation Entries** page.  

### Offsetting in reservations  

 Reservations are made against available item quantities. Item availability is calculated in basic terms as follows:  

 `available quantity = inventory + scheduled receipts - gross requirements`

 The following table shows the details of the order network entities that are part of the availability calculation.  

||Field in T27 Item|Source table|Table filter|Source field|  
|-|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|  
|**Inventory**|Inventory|Item Ledger Entry|N/A|Quantity|  
|**Scheduled receipts**|FP Order Receipt (Qty.)|Prod. Order Line|=Firm Planned|Remaining Qty. (Base)|  
|**Scheduled receipts**|Rel. Order Receipt (Qty.)|Prod. Order Line|=Released|Remaining Qty. (Base)|  
|**Scheduled receipts**|Qty. on Assembly Order|Assembly Header|=Order|Remaining Qty. (Base)|  
|**Scheduled receipts**|Qty. on Purch. Order|Purchase Line|=Order|Outstanding Qty. (Base)|  
|**Scheduled receipts**|Trans. Ord. Receipt (Qty.)|Transfer Line|N/A|Outstanding Quantity|  
|**Gross requirements**|Qty. On Sales Order|Sales Line|=Order|Outstanding Qty. (Base)|  
|**Gross requirements**|Scheduled Need (Qty.)|Prod. Order Component|<>Simulated|Remaining Qty. (Base)|  
|**Gross requirements**|Qty. on Asm. Component|Assembly Line|=Order|Remaining Qty. (Base)|  
|**Gross requirements**|Trans. Ord. Shipment (Qty.)|Transfer Line|N/A|Outstanding Quantity|  

 For more information, go to [Design Details: Availability in the Warehouse](design-details-availability-in-the-warehouse.md).  

### Manual reservation  

When a user intentionally creates a reservation, the user gains full ownership of and responsibility for these items. This means that the user must also manually change or cancel a reservation. Such manual changes might cause automatic modification of the involved reservations.  

The following table shows when and which modifications might occur:  

|User Action|System Reaction|  
|-----------------|---------------------|  
|Decreasing the reserved quantity|The related quantity fields are updated.|  
|Changing date fields|The related date fields are updated.<br /><br /> **Note:** If the due date on a demand is changed to precede the shipment date or due date of the supply, then the reservation is canceled.|  
|Deleting the order|The reservation is canceled.|  
|Changing location, bin, variant, serial number, or lot number|The reservation is canceled.|  

> [!NOTE]  
> The Late Binding functionality may also change reservations without informing the user, by reshuffling nonspecific reservations of serial or lot numbers. For more information, go to [Design Details: Item Tracking and Reservations](design-details-item-tracking-and-reservations.md).  

### Automatic reservations  

The item card can be set up to automatically reserve items based on demand, such as sales orders. In that case, reservation is made against inventory, purchase orders, assembly orders, and production orders. A warning is issued if the supply is insufficient.  

In addition, various planning functions automatically reserve items to keep a demand linked to a specific supply. The order tracking entries for such planning links contain **Reservation** in the **Reservation Status** field in the *Reservation Entry* table. Automatic reservations are created in the following situations:  

- A multilevel production order where the **Manufacturing Policy** field of the involved parent and child items is set to **Make-to-Order**. The planning system creates reservations between the parent production order and the underlying production order to ensure they process together. This reservation binding overrides the item's default costing and application method.  

- A production, assembly, or purchase order where the **Reordering Policy** field of the involved item is set to **Order**. The planning system creates reservations between the demand and the planned supply to ensure that the specific supply is created. For more information, go to [Order](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md#order).  

- A production order created from a sales order with the **Sales Order Planning** function is linked to the sales order with an automatic reservation.  

- An assembly order created automatically for a sales order line to fulfill the quantity in the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field. This automatic reservation links the sales demand and the assembly supply so that sales order processors can customize and promise the assembly item to the customer directly. In addition, the reservation links the assembly output to the sales order line through to the shipping activity that fulfills the customer order.  

For supply or demand that isn't allocated, the planning system automatically assigns a reservation status **Surplus**. This could result from demand that is due to forecasted quantities or user-entered planning parameters. This is a legitimate surplus, which the system recognizes, and it doesn't give rise to action messages. The surplus could also be genuine, excess supply or demand that remains untracked. This is an indication of an imbalance in the order network, which causes the system to issue action messages. Note that an action message that suggests a change in quantity always refers to type **Surplus**. For more information, go to [Example: Order Tracking in Sales, Production, and Transfers](#example-order-tracking-in-sales-production-and-transfers) section in this article.  

Automatic reservations created during the planned run are handled in the following ways:  

- They apply to item quantities included in the availability calculation, just like manual reservations. For more information, go to the "Offsetting in Reservations" section in this article.  

- They're included and potentially changed in subsequent planning runs, unlike manually reserved items.  

## Order tracking  

Order Tracking helps the planner maintain a valid supply plan by providing an overview of the offsetting between demand and supply in the order network. The order tracking records serve as the foundation for creating dynamic action messages and planning line suggestions during planning runs.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The order tracking system offsets available stock as orders are entered into the order network. This implies that the system does not prioritize orders that may be more urgent in terms of their due date. It is therefore up to the logic of the planning system or the wisdom of the planner to rearrange these priorities in a meaningful way.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Order tracking policy and the Get Action Messages function are not integrated with Projects. That means that demand related to a project is not automatically tracked. Because it is not tracked, it could cause the use of an existing replenishment with project information to be tracked to another demand, for example, a sales order. Consequently, you may encounter a situation in which your information about available inventory is out of sync.  

### The order network  

The order tracking system is based on the principle that the order network must always remain balanced, ensuring every demand that enters the system is offset by a corresponding supply and vice versa. The system provides this by identifying logical links between all demand and supply entries in the order network.  

This principle implies that a change in demand results in a corresponding imbalance on the supply side of the order network. Conversely, a change in supply results in a corresponding imbalance on the demand side of the order network. In reality, the order network is in a state of constant flux as users enter, amend, and delete orders. Order Tracking processes orders dynamically, reacting to each change at the time that it enters the system and becomes a part of the order network. As soon as new order tracking records are created, the order network is in balance, but only until the next change occurs.  

To increase the transparency of calculations in the planning system, the **Untracked Planning Elements** page displays untracked quantities, which represent the difference in quantity between known demand and suggested supply. Each line on the page refers to the cause of the excess quantity, such as **Blanket Order**, **Safety Stock Level**, **Fixed Reorder Quantity**, **Minimum Order Qty.**, **Rounding**, or **Dampener**.  

### Offsetting in order tracking  

In contrast to reservations, which can only be made against available item quantities, order tracking is possible against all order network entities that are part of  the net requirements calculation of the planning system. The net requirements are calculated as follows:  

`net requirements = gross requirements + reorder point - scheduled receipts - planned receipts - projected available balance`  

> [!NOTE]  
> Demand that is related to forecasts or planning parameters is not order tracked.  

### Example: Order tracking in sales, production, and transfers  

The following scenario shows which order tracking entries are created in the *Reservation Entry* table as results of various order network changes.  

Assume the following data for two items that are set up for order tracking.  

|Item|Parameter|Detail|
|-|-|-|
|Item 1|Name|Component|
||Availability|100 units in EAST location<br /><br />- 30 units of LOTA<br />- 70 units of LOTB|  
|Item 2|Name|Produced Item|
||Production BOM|1 qty. per of Component|  
||Demand|Sale for 100 units at WEST location|  
||Supply|Released production order (generated with the *Sales Order Planning* function for the sale of 100 units)|  

On the **Manufacturing Setup** page, the **Components at Location** field is set to *EAST*.

The following order tracking entries exist in the *Reservation Entry* table based on the data in the table.  

<!--![First example of order tracking entries in Reservation Entry table.](media/supply_planning_RTAM_1.png "supply_planning_RTAM_1")  -->
**Reservation entries**

|Entry No.|Positive|Item No.|Location Code|Quantity|Reservation Status|Description|Lot No.|Source Type|Source ID|Binding|  
|--------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|---------|-------| 
|8|-|COMPONENT|EAST|-70|Tracking|Component|-|5407|101004|-|
|8|Yes|COMPONENT|EAST|70|Tracking|Component|LOTB|32|-|-| 
|9|-|COMPONENT|EAST|-30|Tracking|Component|-|5407|1001004|-| 
|9|Yes|COMPONENT|EAST|30|Tracking|Component|LOTA|32|-|-| 
|10|-|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|-100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|37|1001|Order-to-Order|
|10|Yes|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|5406|101004|Order-to-Order|


#### Entry numbers 8 and 9  

For the component need for LOTA and LOTB respectively, order tracking links are created from the demand in table 5407, *Prod. Order Component*, to the supply in table 32, *Item Ledger Entry*. The **Reservation Status** field contains *Tracking* to indicate that these entries are dynamic order tracking links between supply and demand.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Lot No.** field is empty on the demand lines because the lot numbers are not specified on the component lines of the released production order.  

#### Entry number 10  

From the sales demand in table 37, *Sales Lines*, an order tracking link is created to the supply in table 5406, *Prod. Order Line*. The **Reservation Status** field contains *Reservation*, and the **Binding** field contains *Order-to-Order*. This is because the released production order was generated specifically for the sales order and must remain linked, unlike order tracking links with a reservation status of Tracking, which is created and changed dynamically. For more information, go to the [Automatic Reservations](#automatic-reservations) section in this article.  

 At this point in the scenario, the 100 units of LOTA and LOTB are transferred to WEST location by a transfer order.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Only the transfer order shipment is posted at this point, not the receipt.  

 Now the following order tracking entries exist in the *Reservation Entry* table.  

<!-- ![Second example of order tracking entries in Reservation Entry table.](media/supply_planning_RTAM_2.png "supply_planning_RTAM_2")  -->
**Reservation entries**

|Entry No.|Positive|Item No.|Location Code|Quantity|Reservation Status|Description|Lot No.|Source Type|Source ID|Binding|  
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|---------|-------| 
|9|-|COMPONENT|EAST|-30|Surplus|Component|-|5407|1001004|-| 
|10|-|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|-100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|37|1001|Order-to-Order|
|10|Yes|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|5406|101004|Order-to-Order|
|12|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|70|Surplus|Component|LOTB|5741|1011|-| 
|14|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|30|Surplus|Component|LOTA|5741|1011|-| 
|15|Yes|COMPONENT|OUT.LOG.|70|Surplus|Component|LOTB|32|-|-| 
|16|Yes|COMPONENT|OUT.LOG.|30|Surplus|Component|LOTA|32|-|-| 

#### Entry numbers 8 and 9  

Order tracking entries for the two lots of the component reflecting demand in table 5407 are changed from a reservation status of *Tracking* to *Surplus*. The reason is that the supplies that were linked to before, in table 32, are used by the shipment of the transfer order.  

Genuine surplus, as in this case, reflects excess supply or demand that remains untracked. It's an indication of an imbalance in the order network, which generates an action message by the planning system unless it's resolved dynamically.  

#### Entry numbers 12 to 16  

Because the two lots of the component are posted on the transfer order as shipped but not received, all related positive order tracking entries are of reservation type *Surplus*, indicating that they aren't allocated to any demands. For each lot number, one entry relates to table 5741, *Transfer Line*, and one entry relates to the item ledger entry at the in-transit location where the items now exist.  

At this point in the scenario, the transfer order of the components from *EAST* to *WEST* location is posted as received.  

Now the following order tracking entries exist in the *Reservation Entry* table.  

<!-- ![Third example of order tracking entries in Reservation Entry table.](media/supply_planning_RTAM_3.png "supply_planning_RTAM_3") -->
 **Reservation entries**

|Entry No.|Positive|Item No.|Location Code|Quantity|Reservation Status|Description|Lot No.|Source Type|Source ID|Binding|  
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|---------|-------| 
|8|-|COMPONENT|EAST|-70|Surplus|Component|-|5407|101004|-| 
|9|-|COMPONENT|EAST|-30|Surplus|Component|-|5407|1001004|-|
|10|-|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|-100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|37|1001|Order-to-Order|
|10|Yes|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|5406|101004|Order-to-Order|
|17|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|70|Surplus|Component|LOTB|32|-|-| 
|18|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|30|Surplus|Component|LOTA|32|-|-| 

The order tracking entries are now similar to the first point in the scenario before the transfer order was posted as shipped only, except entries for the component are now of reservation status *Surplus*. This is because the component need is still at *EAST* location, reflecting that the **Location Code** field on the production order component line contains *EAST* as setup in the **Components at Location** field. The supply that was allocated to this demand before was transferred to *WEST* location and can't be fully tracked unless the component need on the production order line is changed to *WEST* location.  

At this point in the scenario, the **Location Code** on the production order component line is set to *WEST*. In addition, on the **Item Tracking Lines** page, the 30 units of LOTA and the 70 units of LOTB are assigned to the production order component line.  

Now the following order tracking entries exist in the *Reservation Entry* table.  

<!-- ![Fourth example of order tracking entries in Reservation Entry table.](media/supply_planning_RTAM_4.png "supply_planning_RTAM_4")   -->
 **Reservation entries**

|Entry No.|Positive|Item No.|Location Code|Quantity|Reservation Status|Description|Lot No.|Source Type|Source ID|Binding|  
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|---------|-------| 
|10|-|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|-100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|37|1001|Order-to-Order|
|10|Yes|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|5406|101004|Order-to-Order|
|21|-|COMPONENT|WEST|-70|Tracking|Component|LOTB|5407|101004|-| 
|21|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|70|Tracking|Component|LOTB|32|-|-| 
|22|-|COMPONENT|WEST|-30|Tracking|Component|LOTA|5407|1001004|-| 
|22|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|30|Tracking|Component|LOTA|32|-|-| 

#### Entry numbers 21 and 22  

Since the component need changed to *WEST* location, and the supply is available as item ledger entries at *WEST* location, all order tracking entries for the two lot numbers are now fully tracked, indicated by the reservation status of *Tracking*.  

The **Lot No.** field is now filled in the order tracking entry for table 5407 because the lot numbers were assigned to the production order component lines.  

## Action messaging  

When the order tracking system detects an imbalance in the order network, it automatically creates an action message to notify the user. Action messages are system-generated calls for user action that specify the details of the imbalance and suggestions on how to restore balance to the order network. They display as planning lines on the **Planning Worksheets** page when you choose **Get Action Messages** action. In addition, action messages on planning lines are generated during the planning run to reflect the planning system's suggestions to restore balance to the order network. In both cases, the suggestions are run on the order network, when you choose **Carry Out Action Message** action.  

An action message addresses one BOM level at a time. If the user accepts the action message, this might give rise to additional action messages at the next BOM level.  

The following table shows the action messages that exist.  

|Action message|Description|  
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Change Qty.**|Changes the quantity on an existing supply order to cover a changed or new demand.|  
|**Reschedule**|Reschedules the due date on an existing order.|  
|**Resched. & Chg. Qty.**|Reschedules the due date and changes the quantity on an existing order.|  
|**New**|Creates a new order if demand can't be fulfilled by either of the previous action messages.|  
|**Cancel**|Cancels an existing order.|  

The order tracking system always attempts to resolve an imbalance in the existing order network. If this isn't possible, it issues an action message to create a new order. Following is the prioritized list that the order tracking system uses when it determines how to restore balance. If an additional demand enters the order network, the system seeks to order track through the following checks:  

1. Check for any excess supply in the existing order tracking record for this demand.  
1. Check for planned and scheduled receipts in order of receipt date. The latest possible date is selected.  
1. Check for available stock.  
1. Check if a supply order exists in the current order tracking record. If so, the system issues an action message of type *Change* to increase the order.  
1. Check that no supply order exists in the current order tracking record. If so, the system issues an action message of type *New* to create a new order.  

An open demand passes through the list and offsets the available supply at each point. Any remaining demand is always covered by check 4 or check 5.  

If a decrease in demand quantity occurs, the order tracking system attempts to resolve the imbalance by performing the previous checks in reverse order. This means that existing action messages could be modified or even deleted, if necessary. The order tracking system always presents the net result of its calculations to the user.  

## Order tracking and planning  

When the planning system runs, it deletes all existing order tracking records and action message entries and recreates them as planning line suggestions according to supply/demand pairs and priorities. When the planning run finishes, the order network is in balance.  

### Planning system versus order tracking and action messaging  

 The following comparison shows the differences between the methods that are used by the planning system to create planning line suggestions and the methods that are used by the order tracking system to create order tracking records and action messages.  

- The planning system deals with the entire supply and demand pattern of a particular item, whereas order tracking deals with the order that activated it.  

- The planning system deals with all levels of the BOM hierarchy, whereas order tracking deals with one BOM level at a time.  

- The planning system establishes links between demand and supply according to the prioritized due date. Order tracking establishes links between demand and supply according to the order entry sequence.  

- The planning system takes planning parameters into account, whereas order tracking doesn't.  

- The planning system creates links in a user-activated batch mode when it balances demand and supply, whereas order tracking creates the links automatically and dynamically as the user enters orders.

### Once a report is published on my powerbi.com workspace, can I download its pbix? 

Yes. Learn more at [Download a report from the Power BI service to Power BI Desktop](/power-bi/create-reports/service-export-to-pbix).  

<!-- 27 -->
### Can I download the apps as pbix files?

No. Currently, we don’t offer downloading pbix files for the official Power BI apps, because they're published on AppSource.

## Questions about user access and licensing


<!-- 14 -->
### Do I need a Power BI Pro license to publish reports?

<!-- todo What does " or for every user that consults the published report" mean? fixed -->
No. A Pro license isn't needed to publish reports. The standard (free) Power BI license is enough. Learn more in [Power BI Licensing](admin-powerbi-setup.md#license).

<!-- 15 -->
### Is there anything I can't do with the free license?

You can't share reports or install the Business Central apps for Power BI. The free license allows you to create almost all variations of charts and reports.

<!-- 16 -->
### If someone shares a report with another person, then that person needs a Pro license to see the report. Are there plans to make this capability possible with the free license?

We don't have control over this requirement. Power BI sets this requirement. Learn more at [Share Power BI dashboards and reports with coworkers and others](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards).  

### How do guest users and delegated admins access my organization's data and reports?

There are some differences and limitations for external users, like guest users and delegated admins. For instance, external users typically have a Power BI license assigned by their own organization. When they sign in to Power BI or Power BI Desktop, they connect to their organization's tenant and shared workspaces by default.

To access your organization's data and shared workspaces or reports, external users must connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant. From Power BI service, they can use the tenant switcher (preview) to connect. Power BI Desktop doesn't support connecting to a provider tenant's data source or service for creating and publishing reports. External users need to use the Power BI service to upload Power BI Desktop files.

<!--
1. Sign in to [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com).
1. In the upper-right corner, select the profile picture to open the account manager, and then select **Switch** next to **Tenant name**.
1. In the **Switch tenant (preview)** dialog, open the dropdown menu and choose the tenant.-->

Learn more about the features and limitations for guests users in [Distribute Power BI content to external guest users](/power-bi/enterprise/service-admin-azure-ad-b2b).
<!--
To access and design reports with your organization's data, external users must connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant. The connection method differs in Power BI service and Power BI Desktop.

<!-- ## [Designer](#tab/designer) -->
## Questions about the Power BI Designer

<!-- 7 -->
### Does the connector work with pages exposed as web services?

Web services are an old technology and aren't recommended to use with Power BI. The Power BI connector supports both Business Central web services and API pages, but API pages generally have better performances and are more suited for making data available to other systems. Learn more at [Enable Power BI connector to work with Business Central APIs, instead of with web services only](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/enable-power-bi-connector-work-business-central-apis-instead-web-services-only).

### Can I build a Power BI report using the Sales Invoice Lines or Journal Lines APIs?

The most commonly used line records are available in the [Business Central APIs v2.0](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/)). So you can use them to build reports in Power BI by selecting them in the **Dynamics 365 Business Central** connector. However, the **Lines** APIs are designed for use with specific filters only, and might not work in your scenario. You might get an error similar to "You must specify an ID or a Document ID to get the lines." To fix this problem, do the following steps when getting data from Business Central for the report in Power BI Desktop:

1. Instead of including the data source for the lines entity, add the parent data source. For example, add **Sales Invoice** instead of **Sales Invoice Lines**.
2. Select **Transform Data** in the Power BI Desktop action bar.
3. Select the query you just added, for example **Sales Invoices**.
4. To reduce the number of records loaded in your report, apply any needed filtering on the records.
5. Scroll vertically until you find a column named as the lines, for example **SalesInvoiceLines**.
6. Select the expand button in the header of the column, next to the column name.

   :::image type="content" source="media/saleinvoicelines.png" alt-text="Shows the SalesInvoiceLines column in Power BI Desktop.":::
<!-- 11 --> 
### Is it possible to choose which Business Central environment to get data from for Power BI, for example, like a sandbox or production environment? 

Yes. It can be easily chosen. When you connect to Business Central using the connector, you have to choose the environment and company name.

<!-- 6 --> 
### Can I merge data from several production environments of the same tenant?

Yes. In Power BI, just run the "get data" operation again and choose the environment you want.

<!-- 25 -->
### Which pages in Business Central have the Power BI Report part?  

Currently, there are a few selected pages that have a FactBox with a **Power BI Reports** part for displaying a report. 

On list pages, the **Power BI Reports** part is filtered to show reports that pertain to data in the list. Here's the list type pages that include the **Power BI Reports** part:

|Page ID|Name|
|-------|----|
|22|Customer List|
|27|Vendor List|
|31|Item List|
|9305|Sales Order List|
|9308|Purchase Invoices|

Here are other pages that contain the larger, nonfiltered **Power BI Reports** part:

|Page ID|Name|
|-------|----|
|1156|Company Detail|
|4013|Intelligent Cloud Insights |
|9006|Order Processor Role Center|
|9008|Whse. Basic Role Center|
|9010|Production Planner Role Center|
|9015|Job Project Manager RC|
|9016|Service Dispatcher Role Center|
|9022|Business Manager Role Center|
|9024|Security Admin Role Center|
|9026|Sales & Relationship Mgr. RC|
|9027|Accountant Role Center|

> [!TIP]
> We don't have plans to add it to all list pages at the moment. However, you can create a simple page extension that adds the **Power BI Reports** part in a FactBox. Learn more at [Adding Power BI Report Parts to Pages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-power-bi-report-parts) in the Developer and IT Pro help.

<!-- 5 -->
### Is there any way to filter a dataset from Business Central *before* I pull it into Power BI, instead of applying filters afterwards?

To filter larger datasets, the easiest way is to set a filter on your Power BI report by editing directly the Power Query formula. Most of the filters you set this way are passed on to Business Central through query folding. See [Incremental refresh for datasets](/power-bi/admin/service-premium-incremental-refresh).

There's currently no way of setting a filter for the web service data from within Business Central. If your application needs to set a filter from within Business Central, you must create a custom Business Central App for this purpose.

<!-- 10 -->
### From Power BI, besides using a query, is there another way to get data from Business Central tables that don't have an associated page? For example, like the *Item Attributes Value Mapping* table.

No. Not at this point.

<!-- 12 --> 
### Are published queries faster to use than published pages?

When it comes to web services, published queries are usually faster than equivalent published pages. The reason is that queries are optimized for reading data and don’t contain expensive triggers like OnAfterGetRecord.

Web services are based on pages or queries that are built for access from the web and not optimized for access from external services. Even though the Business Central connector still supports getting data from web services, we encourage you to use API pages instead of web services whenever possible.

<!-- 13 --> 
### Is there a way for an end user to create a web service with a column that's in a Business Central table, but not a page? Or does the developer have to create a custom query? 

There's currently no way of adding a new field to a web service. API pages offer full flexibility on the page structure, so a developer can create a new API page to meet this requirement. 

<!-- 28 --> 
### Can I connect Power BI to a read-only database server of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online? 

By default, the Power BI connector reads data from a read-only replica of the Business Central database, which is the case for all reports created after February 2022. This behavior causes your reports to refresh faster and has less impact on performance if you're using Business Central while a report is refreshing. We still recommend that you schedule your reports to refresh outside of normal working hours whenever possible.

If you have old reports based on Business Central data, they don't connect to the read-only database replica. In this case, consider recreating the query inside Power BI so that it uses the latest defaults.

### <a name="databasemods"></a>When I use the Power BI connector to connect to my custom [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] API page, I get the error "Cannot insert a record. Current connection intent is Read-Only." How can I fix it?

Reports that use Business Central data connect to a read-only replica of the Business Central database by default. In rare cases, this behavior might cause the error "Current connection intent is Read-Only.". This error typically happens because your custom API is making modifications to Business Central records while Power BI tries to get the data. In particular, it happens as part of the AL triggers: OnInit, OnOpenPage, OnFindRecord, OnNextRecord, OnAfterGetRecord, and OnAfterGetCurrRecord.

To fix this issue by forcing the Business Central connector to allow this behavior, see [Building Power BI Reports to Display Business Central Data - Fixing Problems](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md#fixing-problems).

<!--
In general, we recommend avoiding any database modifications in API pages when they're opening or loading records, because they cause performance issues and might cause your report refresh to fail. In some cases, you might still need to make a database modification when your custom API page opens or loads records. You can force the Business Central connector to allow this behavior. Do the following steps when getting data from Business Central for the report in Power BI Desktop:

1. Start Power BI Desktop.
2. In the ribbon, select **Get Data** > **Online Services**.
3. In the **Online Services** pane, select **Dynamics 365 Business Central**, then **Connect**.
4. In the **Navigator** window, select the API endpoint that you want to load data from.
5. In the preview pane on the right, you'll see the following error:

   *Dynamics365BusinessCentral: Request failed: The remote server returned an error: (400) Bad Request. (Cannot insert a record. Current connection intent is Read-Only. CorrelationId: [...])".*

6.	Select **Transform Data** instead of **Load** as you might normally do.
7. In **Power Query Editor**, select **Advanced Editor** from the ribbon.
8.	Replace the following line:

   ```
   Source = Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions(null, null, null, null),
   ```

   with the line:

   ```
   Source = Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions(null, null, null, [UseReadOnlyReplica = false]),
   ```

9.	Select **Done**.
10. Select **Close & Apply** from the ribbon to save the changes and close Power Query Editor.

-->
### <a name="perms"></a>How do I change or clear the user account I'm currently using to connect to Business Central from Power BI Desktop?

In Power BI Desktop, do the following steps:

1. In the File menu, select **Options and settings** > **Data source settings**.
2. Select **Dynamics Business Central** from the list, then select **Clear permissions** > **Delete**.

Then next time you connect to Business Central to get data, you'll be asked to sign in.


<!-- ## [Performance](#tab/performance) -->
## Questions about data refresh performance

<!-- 17 -->

### Is it faster to get data using API pages than using web services?

Yes. Our tests indicate that API pages are up to 25% more performant than web services.

<!-- 18 -->
### Are there plans to have a mirror on the Azure SQL Database instance, which I can connect to directly?

No. Not at this point. You can only communicate with Business Central through APIs.

<!-- 19 -->
### Loading data from Business Central web services seems slow. Is there any way to get data directly from the SQL database table?

No. Direct access to the database isn't possible, but switching to API pages helps greatly.

## Troubleshooting questions

### My semantic model does not refresh. How do I see what is wrong?

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-refresh-tsg-include](includes/powerbi-refresh-tsg-include.md)]

<!-- ## [Advanced](#tab/advanced) -->
## Advanced questions
<!-- 1 -->

### Are there plans for the Power BI connector to support the incremental refresh features in the Power BI Service?

Yes. It's on our roadmap.

<!-- 2 -->
### If a Business Central on-premises solution doesn't have internet access, can I still use Power BI?
<!-- todo: please explain this one-->

Yes. In this case, you use Power BI Desktop locally and connect to the Business Central on-premises. Once connected, can create and view reports, but you just can't publish them to the Power BI Service. 
<!-- 20 -->
### Are there any plans to make it possible to replicate Business Central online databases so they're accessible for read-only SQL queries? This capability would support incremental refresh and be a lot faster than APIs or web services.

<!-- todo: what does "BC-Saas-DB-replicated DB accessible" mean? fixe-->
Yes. We have this feature on our long-term roadmap. 

<!-- 21 -->
### If I use Azure Data Factory to get data from Business Central and consume it on Power BI, does that help in increase in performance? 

Yes. This advanced scenario helps Business Central stay performant, because the data access would be done via the Azure Data Factory.

<!-- 22 -->
### Are there any plans to support Power BI deployment pipelines or a way to build deployment pipelines for PBI reports, similar to extensions? Or maybe even a simple API in the Business Admin Center? 

We're looking into this feature. Power BI offers rich APIs to control report deployments. Learn more at [Introduction to deployment pipelines](/power-bi/create-reports/deployment-pipelines-overview).

### When I get data from Business Central to use in my Power BI reports, I see some values like "_x0020_". What are these values?

Some API pages, including most API v2.0 pages, have fields based on [AL Enum objects](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-extensible-enums). Fields based on AL enum objects must have names that are consistent and always the same, so that filters on the report always work&mdash;no matter the language or operating system you're using. For this reason, the fields based on AL enums aren't translated and are encoded to avoid any special character, including the space. In particular, whenever there's an empty option in the AL Enum object, it's encoded to "_x0020_". You can always apply a transformation to your data on Power BI if you want to display some different value for these fields, for example "Empty".

# Set Up Shipping Agents
You can set up a code for each of your shipping agents and enter information about them.  

If you enter an Internet address for the shipping agent, and the agent provides package tracking services on the Internet, you can use the automatic package tracking feature. For more information, see [Track Packages](sales-how-track-packages.md).

When you set up shipping agents on your sales orders, you can also specify the services that each shipping agent offers.  
For each shipping agent, you can set up an unlimited number of services, and you can specify a shipping time for each service.  

When you have assigned a shipping agent service to a sales order line, the shipping time of the service will be included in the order promising calculation, for that line. For more information, see [Calculate Order Promising Dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md).

## To set up a shipping agent  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shipping Agents**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].  
3.  Choose the **Shipping Agent Services** action.
4. In the **Shipping Agent Services**, fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]  
>  If you delete the shipping agent on the order line, the shipping agent service code is also deleted. The contents of fields that were based in part on the shipping agent service are recalculated.

# Manufacturing analytics

Businesses capture lots of data during daily activities that supports business intelligence (BI) for manufacturing, such as:

- Utilization
- Capacity
- Work center load
- Production time
- Production scrap

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's manufacturing data:

- Power BI reports for manufacturing
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using Open in Excel)
- Built-in manufacturing analytics tools
- Built-in manufacturing reports

Each feature has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of analysis you want to do and your role. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to gain insights into your manufacturing processes.

## Analytics needs in manufacturing

When you think about analytics in manufacturing, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes different needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use data in different ways. For example, people in manufacturing interact with data differently than people in finance.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role  | Data aggregation | Typical ways to consume data          |
|------------------- |-------------------| ---------------------- |
| COO / CFO / CEO | Performance data  | KPIs, dashboards, financial reports               |
| Plant Manager     | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports, ad-hoc analysis      |
| Factory worker | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports, on-screen task data |

## Using Power BI to monitor key performance indicators in manufacturing

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. Businesses often use the following KPIs to monitor production performance:

- Total Actual Cost with sub-cost calculations such as Actual Material Cost, Actual Capacity Cost, and more
- Expected Cost, Expected Cost Variance, and Expected Cost Dev %
- Total Standard Cost, Standard Cost Variance, and Standard Cost Dev %
- Planned vs. Finished Quantity

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/finished-production-order-breakdown-v26.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Finished Production Order Breakdown Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/finished-production-order-breakdown-v26.png":::

These KPIs, and more, are available for manufacturing in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-manufacturing-app-name](includes/power-bi-manufacturing-app-name.md)] for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Manufacturing KPIs](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md).

### Reports in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-manufacturing-app-name](includes/power-bi-manufacturing-app-name.md)]

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-manufacturing-app](includes/power-bi-manufacturing-app.md)]

To learn more, go to [Power BI Manufacturing app](manufacturing-powerbi-app.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of manufacturing data

Sometimes you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data Analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **Item Ledger Entries** or **Capacity Ledger Entries**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

> [!TIP]
> If you configure OneDrive for system features, the Excel workbook opens in your browser.

## Built-in reports for manufacturing

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports to help manufacturing organizations report on their data.

[!INCLUDE [report-explorer-manufacturing](includes/report-explorer-manufacturing.md)]

To learn more about reports that are relevant for manufacturing, go to [Built-in production report overview](production-reports.md).

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you manufacturing overviews and tasks to do, such as:

- [View the load in work and machine centers](production-how-to-view-the-load-on-work-centers.md)  

## Print barcodes for finished goods on production orders

To remove a step or two from the process of tracking finished goods, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a **Print Label** action on the **Released Production Order** and **Finished Production Order** pages. The action prints a report that includes the **Item No.**, **Description**, **Unit of Measure**, and 1D and 2D barcode information from the orders. On the request page, you can also specify whether to print the **Lot No.**, **Serial No.** or **Package No.** values as barcodes.

> [!NOTE]
> Some printers and barcode/QR code formats require a specific implementation. You might need to upload a different Word template.
>
> Check with your equipment supplier to learn how to print Word documents on your device.
 If you decide to clone the report to create your own custom version, you can easily connect if you select **Prod. Output Item Label** on the **Report Selection Production Order** page.

# Set Up Universal Print Printers

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Universal Print is a Microsoft 365 subscription-based service that runs entirely on Microsoft Azure. It gives you centralized printer management through the Universal Print portal. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes printers set up in Universal Print available to client users through the **Universal Print Integration** extension.

![Universal Print setup.](media/Universal-Print-arch.png)

The complete setup requires you work in both Microsoft Azure, using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The setup is divided between two main tasks as described in this article:

1. In Microsoft Azure, set up Universal Print and add the printers you want to use in Business Central to a print share. Go to [this section](#set-up-universal-print-and-printers-in-microsoft-azure).
2. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], add the printers from the print shares in Universal Print. Go to [this section](#add-printers-in-business-central-online) for online or [here](#add-printers-in-business-central-on-premises) for on-premises.

## Prerequisites

- Supported printers

  [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the same printers as Universal Print, which can be either Universal Print–compatible or non-compatible printers. Non-compatible printers can't communicate with Universal Print directly, so they require extra connector software, which is provided by Universal Print. Some older printers may not be supported. 

- Universal Print:

  - A Universal Print subscription/license for your organization.

    Learn more at [License Universal Print](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-license).

  - You have at least the [Printer Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#printer-administrator) role in Microsoft Entra ID.

    To manage Universal Print, your account must have at least the [Printer Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#printer-administrator) role in Microsoft Entra ID. These roles are only needed for managing Universal Print. They aren't required by people setting up and  the printers from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

- [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises:

  - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2021 release wave 1 or later.
  - **Universal Print Integration** extension is installed.

    This extension is published and installed by default as part of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises. You can verify whether it's installed on the **Extension Management** page. Learn more at [Installing and Uninstalling Extensions in Business Central](ui-extensions-install-uninstall.md).
- [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises only:
  - Microsoft Entra ID or NavUserPassword authentication is configured.
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Universal Print extension doesn't support service-to-service (S2S) authentication. It requires a signed-in user to send print jobs to the Universal Print service through Graph API.
  - An application for Business Central is registered in your Microsoft Entra tenant and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

    Like other Azure services that work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], Universal Print requires an app registration for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Microsoft Entra ID. The app registration provides authentication and authorization services between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Universal Print.

    Your deployment may already use an app registration for other Azure services, like Power BI. If so, then use the existing app registration for Universal Print as well, instead of adding a new one. The only thing you'll need to do, in this case, is modify the app registration to include the relevant print permissions for Microsoft Graph API: **PrinterShare.ReadBasic.All**, **PrintJob.Create**, and **PrintJob.ReadBasic.** 

    To register an app and set the proper permissions, follow the steps described in [Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure#register-an-application-in-azure-active-directory).

## Set up Universal Print and printers in Microsoft Azure

Before you can start managing Universal Print printers in Business Central, there are several tasks to get Universal Print up and running in Azure with the printers you want to use.

For detailed instructions on how to get set up, see [Get started: Set up Universal Print](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-getting-started) in the Universal Print documentation. Here's an overview of the steps you'll need to complete. Most of these steps are done in the Azure portal.

1. Assign Universal Print licenses to yourself and other users.

    How you assign the license depends on whether you're integrating with Business Central online or on-premises.

    - With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you assign licenses using the Microsoft 365 admin center.

      Learn more at [Microsoft Admin Center Help - Assign licenses to users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users).

    - With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you assign licenses in your tenant using the Azure portal.

      Learn more at [Assign or remove licenses in the Azure portal](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/license-users-groups).

2. Install the Universal Print connector for registering printers that can't communicate with Universal Print directly.

    Most in-market printers can't communicate with Universal Print directly, so you'll need to install the Universal Print connector. Learn more at [Installing the Universal Print Connector](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-connector-installation).

3. Register your printers in Universal Print.

    Registering a printer makes Universal Printer aware of the printer.

    - For printers that can communicate directly with Universal Print, follow the steps provided by the printer manufacturer.

    - For other printers, register the printers by using the Universal Print connector. 

      Learn more at [Printer registration](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-connector-printer-registration).

4. Change printer properties (optional)

    After a printer is registered, you can view and modify printer properties, such as default preferences.

    Learn more at [Managing Printer Settings using the Universal Print Portal](/universal-print/reference/portal/printer-settings).

5. Share the printers with users.

    Any printer you want to use in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will need to be added to a *printer share* in Universal Print. Any user who needs access to the printer must be added as a member of the printer share. Learn more at [Share a Printer](/universal-print/reference/portal/share-printers).

    > [!TIP]
    > You can always add or remover users later. Learn more at [Configure user permssions for printer share](/universal-print/reference/portal/share-printers#configure-user-permissions-for-a-printer-share).

6. Enable document conversion.

    Universal Print renders content for print in XPS format. Some legacy in-market printers don't support XPS content rendering&mdashin many cases, only PDF format. Printing to these printers will fail unless Universal Print is set up to convert documents to the printer-supported format.

    Learn more at [Document conversion](/universal-print/reference/portal/settings#2-document-conversion).

Now, you're ready to add the printers to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], set up default printers for reports, and print.  

## Add printers in Business Central online

After printers are set up and shared in Universal Print, you're ready to add them to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for use. There are two ways to add Universal Print printers. You can add the printers all at once or individually, one at a time.

Adding printers individually let's you set up the same Universal Print printer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] more than once. Then, for each added printer, you can change the print settings, like paper tray, size, and orientation. This way, you can set up printers for different reports and documents with special output requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> Are you using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises? If so, go to the [next section](#add-printers-in-business-central-on-premises), the first time setup is slightly different.  
<!-- To Do Adding printers individually lets you duplicate printers with custom , like different paper trays and paper size and orientation.  To add printers individually, you'll need to know printer's share name in Universal Print. -->

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Printer Management**, then select the related link.
2. Select **Universal Print**, then choose one of the following options:

   - **Add all Universal Print printers** to add all printers not already added. You can use this option even if there are already printers added.
   - **Add a Universal Print printer** to add a specific printer.  
3. Follow the on-screen instructions.

    - If you chose **Add all Universal Print printers**, then the **Add Universal Print Printers** setup starts. 

    - If you chose to **Add a Universal Print printer**, then the **Universal Printer Settings** page appears. Fill in the **Name** field, then select **...** next to the **Print Share in Universal Print** field to select the printer share that contains the Universal Print printer. Fill in the remaining fields as needed. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].

After a printer has been added, you can view and change its settings from the **Printer Management** page. Just select the printer, then choose **Edit printer settings**.

## Add printers in Business Central on-premises

<!--With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, unlike online, users aren't automatically authenticated with the registered app in Azure used for the Universal Print service. So, before any Business Central user (including admins) can add or even use Universal Print printers, they'll have to authenticate with the Azure app and grant access to the Universal Print service. The following procedure describes how to initiate this authentication flow. Each user typically only has to do this task once.-->

Before a user can add or use Universal Print printers Business Central, they have to authorize access to the Azure services used by Universal Print and grant it to permission to data and operations like:

- Signing in and reading user profile
- Reading basic print job information
- Creating print jobs

This is typically done the first time they connect to the Azure registered app used for Universal Print. In Business Central online does, this authorization flow is done seamlessly, with no user interaction. But Business Central on-premises operates differently. It requires that you, or any other user who wants to use Universal Print printers, initiate the authentication flow&mdash;usually, one time only. The most direct way is described in the following steps. A less direct way is by connecting to another integrated service that uses the same Azure registered app, like Power BI or OneDrive. Each user typically only has to do this task once.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're an admin, we recommend you complete this task before other users. Then afterwards, inform users who will need to use Universal Print printers how to do it. If the Azure registered app for Universal Print requires admin consent for API permissions, it's easier if you grant consent on behalf of the organization. You can grant admin consent from the Azure Portal or when you run the steps that follow. 

<!-- To Do Adding printers individually lets you duplicate printers with custom , like different paper trays and paper size and orientation.  To add printers individually, you'll need to know printer's share name in Universal Print. -->
### Connect to Universal Print for the first-time

Complete these steps to connect to the Universal Print service for the first-time.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Printer Management**, then select the related link.
2. Select **Universal Print** > **Add all Universal Print printers** to start the **Add Universal Print Printers** assisted setup guide (wizard).
3. Follow the on-screen instructions until you get to the **MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS** page.

    <!--The MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS page appears. You'll be prompted to give consent to Azure Services. You'll be lead through the process of verifying your Microsoft Entra ID setup, checking your Universal Print license, and then adding the printers.-->

   ![Shows the MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS page](media/azure-ad-services-permissions.png "Shows the MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS page")

4. Select the **Authorize Azure Services** link.

   1. If the **Permission Requested** page appears, read it carefully and select **Accept** to agree and continue. If you're running as an admin, you can select **Consent on behalf of organization** if you want to consent for all users.

      ![Shows the Azure request permissions page](media/azure-ad-permissions-requested.png "Azure request permissions page").

   2. If you're prompted, sign in using your name and password.

5. When authorization completes successfully, you're returned to the **Add Universal Print Printers** page. Select **Next** > **Finish** to complete the setup.

After a printer has been added, you can view and change its settings from the **Printer Management** page. Just select the printer, then choose **Edit printer settings**.

Once you complete the initial sign-in, you can use the Universal Print printers to print reports and other print jobs. For more information, go to [Printing a Report](ui-work-report.md#PrintReport). If you want to add, remove, or change any printers, just go back to the **Print Management** page and select **Universal Print**.

## Common problems and resolutions

In this section, you'll learn about the common problems that users may experience when trying to set up or use Universal Print printers.

### You don't have access to the printer \<your-printer\>.

If a user gets this message when trying to print a document to a Universal Print printer, it may be caused by one of the following conditions:

- The user doesn't have Universal Print licensed assigned to their Microsoft 365 or Azure Active AD account. 
- The user isn't assigned to the printer share in Universal Print.
- (On-premises) The Azure app registration used for Universal Print isn't working or has recently changed since the last time the user signed in.
- (On-premises) The user hasn't yet signed in to Azure registered app for Universal Printer app and consented for the first time.

## There was an error fetching printers shared to you.

If a user gets this message when trying to add a Universal Print printer from the **Printer Management** page, it's typically because they haven't yet signed in to Azure registered app for Universal Printer app and consented for the first time. 
<!--

# Audit changes to financial reporting

Financial reporting helps you gather insights into the financial data in your chart of accounts (COA). This article explains ways to monitor changes to your financial report definitions, and how to control access to financial reports.

## Set up the Change Log for financial report definitions

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to the definitions for financial reports. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)] 

The following table lists the table for financial report definitions and their IDs.

| Table | Table ID |
|------ | -------- |
| Report Definition       | 88  |
| Row Definition          | 84  |
| Column Definition       | 333 |

[!INCLUDE [include-audit-changes-to-setup-learn-more-link](includes/include-audit-changes-to-setup-learn-more-link.md)]

## Get notified when financial report definitions change

To add an extra layer of security around your financial report definitions, you can monitor changes to their fields and get an email when someone changes a value. 

To learn more, go to [Get notified when system setup change](across-setup-auditing.md#get-notified-when-system-setup-change)

## Analyze changes to financial report definitions

You can use the Data Analysis feature to answer questions such as:

- Which definition changed?
- Who changed it, and when?

To learn more, go to [Analyze changes to your setup](across-setup-auditing.md#analyze-changes-to-your-setup).

## Permissions to view or edit financial reports

The following table lists the permission sets that control whether you can view or edit financial reports and their report definitions.

# Batch post production consumption

If the flushing method is **Manual**, use a consumption journal to post the components manually.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you select the **Inventory Pick/Movement** option in the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** field on the location card to indicate that the location requires inventory pick processing, you don't need to use this batch job. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] handles consumption when you post the inventory pick. To learn more, go to [Pick for Production in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-production.md).  

You can also set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to automatically post (*flush*) components when you start or finish production orders. To learn more, go to [Enable Flushing of Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md).

## To post consumption for one or more production order lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Consumption Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields with the production order data and the consumption data. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    Use the **Calc. Consumption** action to generate journal lines from production orders based on the actual output (the quantity of finished goods that you reported) or on the expected output (the quantity of finished goods that you expect to produce).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you configured the location to require warehouse pick processing, only quantities that are already picked through a warehouse activity can be entered in the **Quantity** field in the **Consumption Journal** page. It can't be a calculated quantity. To learn more, go to [Pick for Production or Assembly in Advanced Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-internal-operations-in-advanced-warehousing.md).

3. Choose the **Post** action to post the consumption. The related inventories are reduced.

# Create bank deposits

> [!NOTE]
> The ability to create bank deposits is new in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2022 release wave 1 for a lot of country/region versions. If you were using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the United States, Canada, or Mexico before that release, you might be using the earlier capabilities. You can continue, but the new capabilities will replace the old ones in a future release. To start using the new features described in this article, your administrator can go to the **Feature Management** page and turn on **Feature Update: Standardized bank reconciliation and deposits**.  

Use the **Bank Deposits** page to register deposits as a single document that posts one or more entries to a bank account. Typically, bank deposits are used to register cash deposits. The Bank Deposits page is available on the **Cash Management** menu on the Business Manager Role Center, and other Role Centers that deal with cash management.

Amounts on bank deposits can come from several sources:

* Sales, using a G/L account for revenue.
* Customers payments.
* Cash refunds from vendors, or cash payments to them. 

Bank deposit lines contain information about individual deposits, such as checks from customers. The total of the amounts on the lines must add up to the total amount of the deposit.

After you fill in the deposit information and lines, you must post it. Posting updates the relevant ledgers, including the general ledger, and the bank, customer, and vendor ledgers. Posted deposits are stored for future reference on the **Posted Bank Deposits** page.

The **Bank Deposit** report displays customer and vendor deposits with the original deposit amount, the amount of the deposit that remains open, and the amount applied. The report also shows the total posted deposit amount to reconcile.

## Before you start

There are a few things to set up before you can use bank deposits. You must have a number series and general journal template ready. You should also specify whether to post bank deposit amounts as a lump sum. That is, as a total of all the amounts on the deposit lines. Otherwise, each line is posted as an individual entry. Posting a deposit as a single bank ledger entry can make it easier to do bank reconciliation.

### Number series and lump sum deposits

You must set up a number series for bank deposits, and then specify the series in the **Bank Deposit Nos.** field on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page. To learn more about number series, go to [Create Number Series](ui-create-number-series.md).

Also on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, to post deposits as lump sums rather than individual lines, turn on the **Post Bank Deposits as Lump Sum** toggle. Posting a deposit as a lump sum creates one bank ledger entry for the full amount of the deposit, which can make it easier to do bank reconciliation.

### General journal templates for bank deposits

You must also create a general journal template for deposits. You use general journals to post entries to bank, customer, vendor, fixed asset, and general ledger accounts. The journal templates design the general journal to suit the purpose of your work. That is, the fields on the journal template are exactly the ones you need.

The deposits are cash receipts, so you might want to reuse your number series for cash receipt journals. Alternatively, if you need to distinguish between bank deposit and cash receipt journal entries, use a different number series.

You also need to create a batch job for the template. To create a batch job, on the **General Journal Templates** page, choose the **Batches** action. To learn more about batches, go to [Using Journal Templates and Batches](ui-work-general-journals.md#use-journal-templates-and-batches).

## Dimensions on bank deposit lines

The lines on the bank deposit use the default dimensions you specified in the **Department Code** and **Customer group Code** fields. When you choose **Customer** or **Vendor** in the **Account Type** field, the dimensions for the customer or vendor replace the defaults. You can change the dimensions on the lines, if needed.

> [!TIP]
> Dimension on lines are set according to Default Dimension Priorities. Line dimensions prioritized over header dimensions. To avoid conflicts, you can create rules that prioritize when to use a dimension depending on the source. If you want to change how dimensions are prioritized, you can change their rankings on the **Default Dimension Priorities** page. For more information, see [To set up default dimension priorities](finance-dimensions.md#to-set-up-default-dimension-priorities).

## Create a bank deposit

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Deposits**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **New** to open the **Bank Deposit** page.
3. Choose the general journal template that you created for bank deposits.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the general journal template has more than one batch, you'll be prompted to choose one.

4. In the **Bank Account No.** field, choose the bank account in which to make the deposit.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can double-check that you're depositing to the correct account by using the **Account Card** and **Account Ledger Entries** actions to look up the ledger entries for the selected bank account. For example, to check whether similar deposits were made to the account.

5. In the **Total Deposit Amount** field, enter the total amount of the deposit. This total must be the sum of the amounts on all lines.
6. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    The date in the **Posting Date** field and the dimensions in the **Department Code** and **Customergroup Code** fields are assigned to the lines that you create for the bank deposit. You can change them if needed.

7. Depending on whether you want to post the bank deposit as lump sum or each line individually to the bank ledger, turn the **Post as Lump Sum** toggle on or off. The default setting comes from the same toggle on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Currency Code** field shows the currency that is specified for the bank account you chose. You cannot choose a different currency.

8. On the **Lines** FastTab, create a new line for each cash payment that you want to deposit.
9. In the **Account Type** field, specify where the payment originated. For bank deposits, the type is typically **Customer** or **Vendor**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also register a cash payment to a vendor. To do that, choose **Vendor** and then enter the payment amount as a negative number in the **Credit Amount** field on the line.

10. In the **Document No.** field, enter the document number of the invoice from which the credit amount originated. You can use a document number for each line, or the same number for all lines.

    > [!TIP]
    > Typically, you don't need to fill in the **Document Type** field for financial entries. For example, if you're depositing cash from a day's sale you leave the field blank. If you're depositing cash from a customer payment, you choose **Payment**.

11. If you're depositing a cash payment for a specific customer invoice, choose the **Apply Entries** action, and then enter the invoice number in the **Applies-to ID** field.
12. If you're ready to post the bank deposit, choose the **Post** action.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the bank account has default dimensions where the **Value Posting** field contains **Code Mandatory**, **Same Code**, or **No Code**, you must post the deposit as a lump sum. If you don't post as a lump sum, posting might fail because the dimension values of the accounts on the bank deposit lines violate the value posting rules of the bank account.

    > [!TIP]
    > Before you post the deposit, you can use the **Test Report** action to review your data. The report shows whether there are any issues, such as missing data, that might prevent posting.  

## Apply multiple checks for multiple invoices for a customer in a lump sum deposit

You can post lump sum deposits from multiple checks on deposit lines for customer ledger entries. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Deposits**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create or choose a line for the customer, and in the **External Document No.** field, enter the check number.
3. Choose **Apply Entries**.
4. On the **Apply Customer Entries** page, for each document you want to apply the check to, in the **Applies-to ID** field, enter the check number.
5. In the **Amount to apply** field, enter the amount on the check.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When you enter the amount to apply, the **Applies-to ID** field might reset to the bank deposit document number. Double-check the field, and if it reset, reenter the check number.  

6. Choose **OK**.
7. Repeat steps two through six for each check.

   > [!TIP]
   > Before you post the bank deposit, it's a good idea to use the **Test Report** action to validate the applications.

## Find posted bank deposits

The **Posted Bank Deposits** page lists your company's previous deposits. In the list, you can review the comments and dimensions that were specified for the deposits. You can open the bank deposit to view more details, and from there you can investigate further. For example, you can choose the **Find entries** action to view the posted bank ledger entries. From the bank ledger entry, you can find its corresponding posted general ledger entry.

If you want to look up all general ledger entries for the posted deposit lines, go to the **G/L Register** page and use the **General Ledger** action. The action shows all of the general ledger entries, including the entries for customers and vendors.

## Reverse a posted bank deposit

There are a couple of ways to reverse a posted bank deposit:

* On the **Posted Bank Deposits** page, choose the deposit, and then choose the **Undo Posting** action.
* On the **G/L Registers** page, find the register for the deposit, and then choose the **Reverse Register** action.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only reverse a register that contains a single type of entry. That is, the register must contain only customer entries or vendor entries, but not both. If a register contains both you must manually reverse the deposit.

# Transfer bank funds

You might sometimes need to transfer an amount from one bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to another. To do this, you must post the transaction on the **General Journals** page. The task varies depending on whether the bank accounts use the same currency or different currencies.

## To post a transfer between bank accounts with the same currency code

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On a journal line, fill in the **Posting Date** and **Document No.** fields.
3. In the **Account Type** field, select **Bank Account**.
4. In the **Account No.** field, select the bank from which you want to transfer the funds.
5. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount to be transferred.

    Next, you must specify the balancing account. If you can't see the relevant fields, then choose the **Show More Columns** action to view all available fields.
6. In the **Bal. Account Type** field, select **Bank Account**.
7. In the **Bal. Account No.** field, select the bank account to which you want to transfer the funds.
8. Post the journal.

## To post a transfer between bank accounts with different currency codes

To transfer funds between bank accounts that use different currencies, you must post two general journal lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create two journal lines, and fill in the **Posting Date** and **Document No.** fields.
3. On the first journal line, in the **Type** field, select **Bank Account**.
4. In the **Account No.** field, select the bank account from which you want to transfer the funds.
5. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount in the currency of the bank account with or without a minus sign.

    > [!TIP]
    > An amount without a sign is a debit, and an amount with a minus sign is a credit.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Some companies prefer to transfer between accounts on separate journal lines. Other companies prefer to post everything on one journal line by using a balancing account. Check with your local expert if you're not sure what to do.
    >
    > If your company prefers to use a balancing account, then set the **Bal. Account Type** field to **Bank Account**, and set the **Bal. Account No.** field to the bank account to which you want to transfer the funds. Then proceed to step 9 or 10.
    >
    > If your company prefers to use a separate journal line, then move on to the next step.
6. On the second journal line, in the **Type** field, select **Bank Account**.
7. In the **Account No.** field, select the bank account to which you want to transfer the funds.
8. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount in the currency of the bank account with or without a minus sign.

    > [!TIP]
    > An amount without a sign is a debit, and an amount with a minus sign is a credit.
9. If the exchange rates used in the journal are different than the exchange rates on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page, enter a new journal line for the exchange rate gain or loss.  

    1. Enter **G/L Account** in the **Account Type** field.  

    2. Enter the G/L account number for exchange rate gain or loss in the **Account No.** field.  

    3. Enter the exchange rate gain or loss in the **Amount** field with or without a minus sign.

    > [!TIP]
    > An amount without a sign is a debit, and an amount with a minus sign is a credit.
10. Post the journal.

# FAQs for analysis assist (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the analysis assist feature in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is analysis assist?

Analysis assist is a copilot that provides assistance for working with the [data analysis mode](analysis-mode.md) in Business Central. The data analysis mode enables you to organize, aggregate, and summarize data on pages and queries to make it more suitable for analyzing and extracting meaningful insights. With analysis assist, you can automatically construct the view of the data you want to analyze by expressing your needs in simple, natural language, like "show vendors by location sorted by number of purchases." Analysis assist makes it easier to work with data without the need for complex technical skills.

## What are capabilities of analysis assist?

Analysis assist converts natural language instructions into a structured design for displaying data in the analysis mode, without creating, modifying, or updating customer business data itself.

## What is the intended use of analysis assist?

Analysis assist helps create analysis tabs in the data analysis mode to present data in a manner that makes it easier for you to draw conclusions. However, it's important to note that analysis assist doesn't provide direct insights or conclusions about the data. It's a tool to help users organize and view their data. It's up to the user to extract actionable information, discover trends, and make informed decisions to drive business value.

## How was analysis assist evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

- The feature underwent extensive testing based on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s demonstration data and other fictitious business data. Copilot was given numerous prompts in the supported languages that covered a broad range of instructions and styles of expressing intent. The outcomes were evaluated against accuracy, relevance, and safety.

- The feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. [Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft.](https://aka.ms/RAI)

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content?

Microsoft has various systems in place to ensure that content generated by Copilot is of the highest quality, detect abuse, and ensure safety for our customers and their data.

Users have the opportunity to provide feedback to every Copilot response and report inaccurate or inappropriate content to help Microsoft improve this feature.

- If you encounter inappropriate generated content, report it to Microsoft by using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249810)

- We analyze user feedback on the feature and use it to help us improve responses.

  You provide feedback by using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icon on the **Copilot** pane in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

- Microsoft might disable the Copilot features for selected customers if abuse of the functionality is detected.

## What are the limitations of analysis assist? How can users minimize the impact of the analysis assist limitations when using the system?

- General AI limitations:

  AI systems are valuable tools but they're nondeterministic. The content they generate might not be accurate. It's important to use your judgment to review and verify responses before making decisions that could affect stakeholders like customers and partners.

- Geographic and language availability

   [!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability.md)]

- Certain industry, product, and subject limitations:

  Organizations that operate in some business domains, such as medical, drugs, legal, and weapons, might experience lower quality of service.

## What data does analysis assist collect and how is it used?

The analysis assist capability collects the minimum data required by Business Central to offer the service. Microsoft doesn't use your company data, including the text you send to Copilot, to train the foundational models for the benefit of others. For more information, see [Dynamics 365 terms for Azure OpenAI-powered features](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2236010).

It also collects data from the feedback users can provide using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icons in the analysis assist **Copilot** page. The data is anonymous and includes the choice of like or dislike, the dislike reason if provided, and the Copilot feature the feedback applies to.

# Move items in advanced warehouse configurations that use directed put-away and pick

You can move items between bins without a demand from a source document. For example, you might want to do that as part of the following activities:

* Reorganize your warehouse.
* Bring items to an inspection area.
* Take items out of the warehouse pick bins temporarily, perhaps to serve as demonstration models in a sales presentation.
* Move extra items to production area for components configured with some flushing methods.
* Move produced or assembled items from production or assembly area to warehouse.
* Move items from bulk storage area to bins you use for picking.

How you move items depends on how your warehouse is set up as a location. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

In warehouse configurations where the **Directed Pick and Put-away** toggle is turned on for locations, you can register unplanned movements on the following pages:  

* Movement Worksheet
* Warehouse Internal Pick
* Warehouse Internal Put-away
* Warehouse Reclassification Journal

The **Movement Worksheet** , **Warehouse Internal Pick**, and  **Warehouse Internal Put-away** pages work in the same way. Use the pages to prepare warehouse activities for warehouse employees. The difference is in the advanced functionality associated with each page, and the different types of warehouse activities that are probably performed by different employees:

* Movement worksheet lets you fill up high-ranking pick bins with items from other bins
* Put-aways use put-away templates
* Picking uses bin ranking and availability

## Warehouse movement worksheet

### To move items with the warehouse movement worksheet

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Movement Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields on the worksheet lines manually, or use one of the following actions to automatically fill in the lines:

    * **Get Bin Content** fills in the worksheet lines with the contents of the bin or bins you specify.
    * **Calculate Bin Replenishment** uses the bin rankings to suggest replenishment for high-ranking bins from low-ranking bins.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the item meets the criteria in the list below, the **From Zone** and **From Bin** fields will be blank. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates from where to move the items only when you use the **Create Movement** action.  
    >  
    > * The item has an expiration date.  
    > * The **Pick According to FEFO** toggle is turned on for the location.  
    > * You're using the **Calculate Bin Replenishment** feature.  

3. Choose the **Create Movement** action to create the movement. When the move is complete, you can register it.  

### To register the warehouse movement

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Movements**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the movement document to register.  
3. On **Place** lines, specify where, which, and by when to move the item by choosing values in the **Zone Code**, **Bin Code**, **Qty. to Handle**, or **Due Date** fields.  
4. On **Take** lines, in the **Qty. to Handle** field, specify the quantity of the bin content that you want to move. You can only edit this field on **Take** lines. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you must pick or place the items for one line in more than one bin, for example because the designated bin is full, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.
 
5. To register all suggested quantities as specified in the **Quantity** field, choose the **Autofill Qty. to Handle** action.  
6. Choose the **Register** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> For locations that use directed put-away and pick, you can't manually move items in bins of the type **RECEIVE** because they aren't yet considered as available inventory. You must put away the items in these bins before they're available for movements.

## Internal pick  

### To create an internal pick  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Whse. Internal Pick**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the **No.** field, **Location Code** field, and the **To Bin Code** field on the **General** FastTab. The **To Bin Code** field specifies the bin where you want to place the picked items. For production purposes, this bin would be the inbound production bin or the open shop bin. For other purposes, choose a bin code of a bin type that is not used for picking, most likely a staging, shipping, or special purpose bin.  
4. Select an item in the **Item No.** field, and fill in the quantities you want to pick.  
5. Choose the **Create Pick** action. A warehouse pick instruction is now ready for a warehouse employee to perform. Alternatively, choose the **Release** action and create warehouse picks using the **Pick Worksheet** page. To learn more about pick worksheets, go to [Create pick documents in bulk with the pick worksheet](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-for-warehouse-shipment.md#to-create-pick-documents-in-bulk-with-the-pick-worksheet).
6. When the pick is complete, you can register it.  

### To register the warehouse pick

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Picks**, and then choose the related link.  

    To work on a particular pick, select the pick from the list, or filter the list to find the picks that are assigned to you.  
2. If the **Assigned User ID** field is blank, enter your ID to identify yourself, if needed.  
3. Pick the items.  

    Because the warehouse is set up to use directed put-away and pick, bin ranking determines the bins to pick from. The bins are suggested on the pick lines. The instructions contain at least two separate lines for Take and Place actions.  

4. After you pick and place the items in the shipping area or shipping bin, choose the **Register Pick** action.  

## Internal put-away  

### To create an internal put-away  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Internal Put-aways**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the **No.** and **Location Code** fields.
4. Fill in a line for each item to move to the warehouse. The **Item No.** and the **Quantity** fields are required.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you choose an item in the **Item No.** field, the **Bin Contents** page opens instead of the **Items** page. This page opens because you're putting away an item that is assigned to a particular bin - *bin content* - not just an item, and you already know the bin the item should be taken from. If you filled in the **From Bin Code** field, the bin content will be filtered by that value.

5. To fill the lines with the entire bin content or the filtered content of bins in the location, choose the **Get Bin Content** action.  
6. Choose the **Create Put-away** action. A warehouse put-away instruction is now ready for a warehouse employee. Alternatively, choose the **Release** action to create warehouse put-aways using the **Put-away worksheet** page. To learn more about put-away worksheets, go to [Create put-away documents in bulk with the put-away worksheet](warehouse-how-to-put-items-away-with-warehouse-put-aways.md#to-create-put-away-documents-in-bulk-with-the-put-away-worksheet).
6. When the put-away is complete, you can register it.  

### To register the warehouse put away

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Put-aways**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the warehouse put-away that's ready to handle.  
3. If required, enter your user ID when you start work on a put-away.  

    To optimize the put-away process, you can sort the put-away lines by various criteria. For example, by item, shelf number, or due date.
   
    * If the Take and Place lines for each receipt line don't immediately follow one another, and you want them to, sort the lines by selecting **Item** in the **Sorting Method** field.  
    * If the bin rankings reflect the physical layout of the warehouse, use the **Bin Ranking** sorting method to organize the work around the bin locations.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > Lines are sorted in ascending order by the selected criteria. If you sort by document, sorting is done first by document type based on the **Warehouse Activity Source Document** enum. If you sort by ship-to, sorting is done by destination type based on the **Warehouse Destination Type** field.

4. Perform the put-away.

    Each internal put-away line has become at least two lines in the warehouse put-away.  

    * The first line, with **Take** in the **Action Type** field, indicates where the items are located in the receiving area. You can't change the zone and bin on this line.  
    * The next line, with **Place** in the **Action Type** field, shows where to place the items in the warehouse. If you receive a large number of items on one receipt line, you might have to put the items away in several bins, so there's a Place line for each bin.  

5. When you have placed all the items in bins as instructed, choose the **Register Put-away** action.  

## To register a movement that has already happened

If you must register the fact that items has been already moved to other bins without a put-away, pick, or movement, you can use the **Whse. Reclassification Journal** page to register the movement.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Whse. Reclassification Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the **Item No.**, **From Zone Code**, **From Bin Code**, **To Zone Code**, and **To Bin Code** fields.  
3. Choose the **Register** action.

# Prepare financial reporting with financial data and account categories

The **Financial Reports** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. The results display in charts and reports in your Role Center, such as the Cash Flow chart, and the Income Statement and Balance Sheet reports. You access these two reports, for example, with the **Financial Statements** action in the Business Manager and Accountant home pages.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides sample financial reports you can use right away as templates. You can also set up your own reports to specify the figures to compare. For example, you can create financial reports to calculate profit margins using dimensions such as departments or customer groups. The number of financial reports you can create is unlimited and require no involvement of a developer.  

## Prerequisites for financial reporting

Setting up financial reports requires an understanding of the structure of your chart of accounts. There are three key concepts that you likely need to pay attention to before you design your financial reports:

- Map G/L posting accounts to G/L account categories.
- Design how you use dimensions.
- Set up G/L budgets.

G/L account categories simplify your financial report definitions and make them more resilient to changes in the chart of accounts structure. Learn more at [Use G/L account categories to change the layout of your financial statements](bi-row-definitions.md#use-gl-account-categories-to-change-the-layout-of-your-financial-statements).

Setting up dimensions allows you to slice and dice your financial data in ways that make sense for your organization. Learn more at [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

If you want to view general ledger entries as percentages of budget entries, you must create G/L budgets. Learn more at [Create G/L Budgets](finance-how-create-budgets.md).

## Financial reports

Financial reports arrange accounts from your chart of accounts in ways that make data easier to present. You can set up various layouts to define the information you want to extract from the chart of accounts. Financial reports also provide a place for calculations that can't be made directly in the chart of accounts. For example, you can create subtotals for groups of accounts and then include that total in other totals. Another example is to calculate profit margins on dimensions such as departments or customer groups. Additionally, you can filter general ledger entries and budget entries, for example, by net change or debit amount.

> [!NOTE]
> Mathematically, think of a financial report as defined by two things:
>
> - A vector of row definitions that define what needs to be calculated.
> - A vector of column definitions that defines the data for the calculation.
>
> The financial report is then the outer product of these two vectors. The value in each cell is calculated by applying the formula in the row applied to the data definition from the column.

:::image type="content" source="media/financial-report-definition.svg" alt-text="Shows how a financial report is constructed from a row definition and a column definition." lightbox="media/financial-report-definition.svg":::

The **Financial Reports** page shows how all financial reports follow a pattern that consists of the following attributes:

- Name (code)
- Description
- Row definition
- Column definition
- Internal description (introduced in [!INCLUDE[2025_releasewave1_name](includes/2025_releasewave1_name.md)])

:::image type="content" source="media/financial-reports.png" alt-text="Shows how all financial reports are constructed from a row definition and a column definition." lightbox="media/financial-reports.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> The sample finance reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] aren't ready to use out of the box. Depending on how you set up your G/L accounts, dimensions, G/L account categories, and budgets, you need to adjust the sample row and column definitions and the finance reports they're used in to match your setup.

You can also use formulas to compare two or more financial reports and column definitions. Comparisons let can do the following things:

- Create customized financial reports.
- Create as many financial reports as you need, each with a unique name.
- Set up various report layouts and print the reports with the current figures.

To learn more about comparisons, go to [When to use a comparison period formula and comparison date formula in a column definition](bi-design-financial-reports.md#when-to-use-a-comparison-period-formula-and-comparison-date-formula-in-a-column-definition).

## Learning path: Create financial reports in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central

Want to learn how to create budgets and use financial reports, dimensions, and row and column definitions to generate financial reports that businesses often need?

Start on the following learning path [Create financial reports in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](/training/paths/create-financial-reports-dynamics-365-business-central).

## Create a new financial report

You use financial reports to analyze general ledger accounts or to compare general ledger entries with budget entries. For example, you can view the general ledger entries as percentages of the budget entries.

The financial reports in the standard version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might not suit your business needs. To quickly create your own financial reports, start by copying an existing one, as described in step 3 below.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Financial Reports** page, choose the **New** action to create a new financial report name. Alternatively, to reuse settings from an existing financial report, choose the report, and then choose the **Copy Report Definition** action.
1. In the **Name** field, enter a short name for the report

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can't change the name later.
1. In the **Display Title** field, enter a description of the report.
1. Choose a row definition and a column definition.
1. Optionally, choose analysis views for the row and column definitions.
1. Choose the **View Financial Report** action to access more properties on the financial report.
1. On the **Options** FastTab, you can edit the report title, change the row and column definitions, write an internal description, set the formatting for negative numbers, and define how to show dates. Dates can be a Day/Week/Month/Quarter/Year hierarchy, or use accounting periods. To learn more, go to [Comparing accounting periods using period formulas](bi-column-definitions.md#comparing-accounting-periods-using-period-formulas).
1. On the **Dimensions** FastTab, you can define dimension filters for the report.
1. If you want the report output to include an introductory and/or a closing paragraph, add them from the *Definitions* menu (these fields are available from the [!INCLUDE[2025_releasewave1_name](includes/2025_releasewave1_name.md)] and later).  
1. You can now preview the report in the area below the **Dimensions** FastTab.

> [!NOTE]
> When you open a financial report in View or Edit mode, the Filter pane is available. Don't use the Filter pane to set filters for the data in your report. Such filters can cause errors or might not actually filter the data. Instead, use the fields on the **Options** and **Dimensions** FastTabs to set up filters for the report.

### Adding introductory and/or closing paragraphs

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/introduced_in_2025rw1.md)]

If you want the report output to include an introductory and/or a closing paragraph, you can use the **Edit introductory/closing paragraphs** action on the **Definitions** menu. When you export the report to PDF or Excel, these paragraphs display before and after the report body.

### Choosing a format for negative numbers

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/introduced_in_2025rw1.md)]

If you want to control how negative numbers show in the report output (both on-screen and in PDF), you use the **Negative Amount Format** action on the **Options** FastTab to choose your preferred format. The format can be a minus sign or parentheses.

### Show amounts in an additional currency (ACY)

Your general ledger is set up to use your local currency (LCY), but you can set it up to also use another currency with a current exchange rate assigned. If you designate a second currency as an additional reporting currency (ACY), [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically records amounts in both LCY and ACY on each G/L entry.

Financial reports are based on G/L entries. To display report data in the additional reporting currency, select the **Show Amounts in Add. Reporting Currency** checkbox on the **Options** FastTab for the relevant report.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Show Amounts in Add. Reporting Currency** checkbox is only available if you set up an additional reporting currency (ACY).
To learn more, go to [Set Up an Additional Reporting Currency](finance-how-setup-additional-currencies.md).

### Create or edit a row definition

Row definitions in financial reports provide a place for calculations that can't be made directly in the chart of accounts. For example, you can create subtotals for groups of accounts and then include that total in other totals. You can also calculate intermediate steps that aren't shown in the final report.

Row definitions also provide settings for formatting your report. Most of the options provide visual definition to reports when people view or preview them on their monitors, or print them.

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the formatting options don't carry over when you export them to Excel. If you often export reports to Excel, you might skip the formatting here and format the report in Excel instead.

To learn more, go to [Row definitions in financial reporting](bi-row-definitions.md).

### Create or edit a column definition

Use column definitions to specify the columns to include in the report. For example, you can design a report layout to compare net change and balance for the same period this year and last year. You can have up to 15 columns in a column definition. For example, multiple columns are useful for displaying budgets for 12 months with a column that shows the total.

To learn more, go to [Column definitions in financial reporting](bi-column-definitions.md).

## Using dimensions in financial reports

In financial analysis, a dimension is data you add to an entry as a kind of marker. This data is used to group entries with similar characteristics, such as customers, regions, products, and salesperson, and easily retrieve these groups for analysis. You can use dimensions on entries in journals, documents, and budgets.

Each dimension describes the focus of analysis. So, a two-dimensional analysis, for example, would be sales per area. By using more than two dimensions when you create an entry, you can carry out a more complex analysis. An example of a complex analysis is exploring sales per sales campaign per customer group per area. That gives you greater insight into your business, such as how well your business is operating, where it is or isn't thriving, and where you should allocate more resources. That insight helps you make more informed business decisions. To learn more, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

## Set up financial reports with overviews

You can use a financial report to create a statement that compares general ledger figures with budget figures.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.
1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select a financial report.  
1. Choose the **Edit Row Definition** action  
1. On the **Row Definition** page, in the **Name** field, select the default financial report name.
1. Choose the **Insert G/L Accounts** action.  
1. Select the accounts you want to include in your statement, then choose **OK**.

    The accounts are inserted in your financial report. If you want, you can also change the column definition.  
1. Choose the **Edit Financial Report** action.  
1. On the **Financial Report** page, on the **Dimensions** FastTab, set the budget filter to the filter name you want to use.  
1. Choose **OK**.  

Now you can copy and paste your budget statement into a spreadsheet.  

## Best practices for working with financial report definitions

Financial report definitions aren't versioned. When you change a report definition, the old version is replaced when your change saves to the database. The following list contains some best practices for working with financial report definitions:

- If you add report definitions, choose a good code and fill in the description field with a meaningful text while you still know what you use the report for. This information helps your coworkers (and your future self) to work with the report and perhaps changing the report definition.
- Before you change a report definition, consider taking a copy of it as a backup, just in case your change doesn't work as expected. You can either just copy the definition (give it a good name), or export it. To learn more, go to [Import or export financial report definitions](#import-or-export-financial-report-definitions).
- If you need a fresh copy of a definition that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides, an easy way to get one is to create a new company that only contains setup data. Then, export the definition and import it in the company where the definition needs a refresh.

## Import or export financial report definitions

You can import and export financial report definitions as RapidStart configuration packages. For example, configuration packages are useful for sharing information with other companies. The package is created in a .rapidstart file, which compresses the contents.

> [!NOTE]
> When you import financial report definitions, the new definitions replace existing records with the same names. The configuration package for a report definition won't overwrite any existing row or column definitions that the report definition uses.

To import or export financial report definitions, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.
1. Choose the financial report, then choose the **Import Financial Report** or **Export Financial Report** action, depending on what you want to do.

To learn more about how to import or export financial report row or column definitions, go to the following articles: 

- [Import or export financial reporting row definitions](bi-row-definitions.md#import-or-export-financial-reporting-row-definitions), or
- [Import or export financial reporting column definitions](bi-column-definitions.md#import-or-export-financial-report-column-definitions)

## Integrate financial reports with Excel

You can integrate a financial report with an Excel workbook template, adjust the layout to suit your needs, and then update the Excel template with data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this integration makes it easier to generate your monthly and yearly financial statements in a format that works for you.

To learn more, go to [How to integrate financial reports with Excel](finance-financial-reporting-view-a-report.md#integrate-financial-reports-with-excel).

## Print and save financial reports

You can print financial reports using your device's printing services. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also offers options to save reports as PDF files. 

To learn more, go to [How to print and save financial reports](./finance-financial-reporting-view-a-report.md#print-and-save-financial-reports).

# Year-Over-Year (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Year-Over-Year** report helps business leaders analyze purchasing performance and track spending trends over time. By comparing purchase amounts in the current year with amounts from the previous year, this report provides valuable insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of purchasing activities.

In addition to identifying trends and changes, the report helps leaders make informed decisions about future purchasing strategies. It's an important indicator of growth and spending patterns, providing an overview of the money you spend to make products and generate revenues.

Together with year-over-year financial figures, the report gives a comprehensive view of an organization's financial health. Tracking these figures helps leaders make informed decisions about resource allocation, budgeting, and forecasting.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-year-over-year.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Year-over-Year Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-year-over-year.png":::

## Use the report

The report is intended for business leaders and managers.

COOs ensure that the purchasing department operates efficiently and effectively. One of the key metrics you monitor is the year-over-year growth in purchases. This report lets you quickly explore purchase trends over time, and identify areas of concern. For example, you might notice that purchases are increasing rapidly in a particular item category. You can use this information to discuss how to manage costs with the head of purchasing.

Purchasing managers ensure that the company sources goods at the best price without compromising quality. Use this report to track purchasing trends across different categories and identify areas where you can save. For example, you might notice a rapid increase in purchases of a category of products. With this information in mind, you can work with the manufacturing team to identify whether to change item planning or supplier selection to optimize product cost and quality.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Year-Over-Year* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Current Year**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)
- [**Previous Year (Fiscal)**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount-py-fiscal)
- [**Current Year YOY (Fiscal)**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount-yoy-fiscal)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

# Troubleshoot Financial Reporting

This article provides resolutions to a few typical problems you might encounter within Financial Reporting.

## Balancing reports to the general ledger

When you create new financial reports, you might find that they don't balance to the general ledger. The following are the most likely reasons why.

* A new general ledger account was added to the chart of accounts, but not the financial reporting.
* General ledger accounts are missing from the Totaling accounts.
* General ledger accounts are listed multiple times in the Totaling accounts.
* A formula is missing.
* A formula points to the wrong row number reference.
* A formula doesn't include all the necessary rows.
* A formula includes rows more than one time.
* A formula is making an incorrect calculation.
* A formula incorrectly shows a positive value as negative or a negative value as positive.
* A totaling account is being used on a row instead of a posting account.

## Testing a financial report against Trial Balance reports

After you double-check the possible causes stated in the [Balancing reports to the general ledger](#balancing-reports-to-the-general-ledger) section, if you still have an imbalance, consider running one of the **Trial Balance** reports. These reports can serve as a reference point because they correctly lists all G/L accounts in your chart of accounts and always balance to zero. You can compare this version of the trial balance to the rows of your financial report to identify and correct the error.

When you run the Trial Balance report, fill out the report options as follows for a clean, simple, and balanced report to review.

* In the **Show Comparison** field, choose **Last Year**.
* Turn on the **Actual Balances** toggle.
* In the **Round to** field, choose the lowest value available for your currency.
* Turn on the **Print to Excel** toggle.
* On the **Filter** FastTab, in the **Account Type** field, choose **Posting**.
* In the **Date Filter** field, enter the date for the report. <!--Need a better description here.-->
* Turn off all other toggles and leave all other fields blank.

## Testing a financial report against a data analysis on G/L entries

A different method for testing a financial report than what is described in the [Testing a financial report against Trial Balance reports](#testing-a-financial-report-against-trial-balance-reports) section is to use the data analysis feature on the [General Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=20&layout=analysis) page. This allows you to group and summarize amounts by G/L account or G/L account category, and set filters on relevant data properties, such as G/L account, G/L account category, or posting date.

## Adding check figures

One way to quickly identify errors in the design of your financial reporting is to add check figures to your row definitions. You want the figure to calculate to zero, which indicates that the report is correct. When you run financial reporting, a quick glance at the check figure can confirm whether the report is correct.

## When to use net change or balance at date

A typical mistake that financial reporting users make is to incorrectly combine row and column definitions. When column definitions use net change as the row type, the columns are most appropriately combined with income statement reports. When column definitions use balance at date as the row type, the columns are most appropriately combined with balance sheet reports.

An easy way to remember this rule of thumb is to think about what the goal of each report is to the viewer. People use balance sheet reports to find account balances of accounts on a certain date. So, using a Balance at Date column definition makes more sense.

People use income statement reports to explore the activity of each account during a period of time. So, using a Net Change column definition makes more sense.

For experienced accountants, we know that in some cases we can apply either report to analyze accounts. We might want to initially review the balance sheet using Balance at Date, but also use Net Change to see how much activity happened in each account as we review trends over time. We might review the Income Statement initially using Net Change to see the trend of activity over time. But we might also look at the Balance at Date of these accounts to see how much accumulated in them throughout the year.

While there isn't a single correct answer for how to use these different views, there are general conventions accountants use when they design reports for other viewers. These conventions are that the Balance Sheet uses Balance at Date, and the Income Statement uses Net Change.

> [!TIP]
> When you create column definitions, might include **BS** or **IS** in the definition description. Those tags can help report viewers decide which reports should use which column definitions.

# Work with payment tolerances and payment discount tolerances

You can set up a payment tolerance to close an invoice when the payment doesn't fully cover the amount on the invoice. For example, payment tolerances are typically for small amounts that would cost more to correct than to just accept. You can set up a payment discount tolerance to grant a payment discount after the payment discount date.  

Use payment tolerances so that every outstanding amount has a set maximum allowed payment tolerance. If the payment tolerance is met, the payment amount is analyzed. If the payment amount is an underpayment, the underpayment fully closes the outstanding amount. A detailed ledger entry is posted to the payment entry so that no remaining amount is left on the applied invoice entry. If the payment amount is an overpayment, then a new detailed ledger entry is posted to the payment entry so that no remaining amount is left on the payment entry.

You can set up payment discount tolerances so that if you accept a discount after the payment discount date, it always posts to a payment discount or payment tolerance account.

## Applying payment tolerance to multiple documents

A single document has the same payment tolerance, regardless of whether you apply it on its own or with other documents. Acceptance of a late payment discount when you're applying payment tolerance to multiple documents automatically occurs for each document where the following rule is true:  

*payment discount date < payment date on the selected entry <= payment tolerance date*  

This rule also determines whether to display warnings when you apply payment tolerance to multiple documents. The payment discount tolerance warning displays for each entry that meets the date criteria. For more information, see [Example 2 - Tolerance Calculations for Multiple Documents](finance-payment-tolerance-and-payment-discount-tolerance.md#example-2---tolerance-calculations-for-multiple-documents).

You can choose to display a warning that is based on different tolerance situations.  

- The first warning is for the payment discount tolerance. You're informed that you can accept a late payment discount. You can then choose whether to accept tolerance on the discount date.  
- The second warning is for the payment tolerance. You're informed that all entries can be closed because the difference is in the sum of the maximum payment tolerance for the applied entries. You can then choose whether to accept tolerance on the payment amount.

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling the warning message will let choose how to process payments that are within tolerance. If you do not enable the message, and a tolerance level is specified, invoices with amounts that are within tolerance will be automatically closed and you cannot choose to leave the remaining amount. 

For more information, see [To enable or disable payment tolerance warning](finance-payment-tolerance-and-payment-discount-tolerance.md#to-enable-or-disable-payment-tolerance-warnings). 

## To set up tolerances

Tolerance on days and amounts allows you to close an invoice even though the payment doesn't fully cover the amount on the invoice. For example, because the due date for the payment discount has past, goods were deducted, or because of a minor error. This principle also applies to refunds and credit memos.  

To set up tolerance you have to set up various tolerance accounts, specify both payment discount tolerance and payment tolerance posting methods and then run the **Change Payment Tolerance** batch job.  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Posting Setup** page, set up a debit and a credit sales payment tolerance account and a debit and a credit purchase payment tolerance account.  
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.    
4. On the **Customer Posting Groups** page, set up a debit and a credit payment tolerance account. For more information, see [Setting Up Posting Groups](finance-posting-groups.md).  
5. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendor Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
6. On the **Vendor Posting Groups** page, set up a debit and a credit payment tolerance account.  
7. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
8. Open the **General Ledger Setup** page.  
9. On the **Application** FastTab, fill in the **Payment Disc. Tolerance Posting**, **Payment Discount Grace Period** and **Payment Tolerance Posting** fields.   
10. Choose the **Change Payment Tolerance** action.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you choose **Apply to Oldest** in the **Application Method** field on a **Customer Card** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will not automatically post payment tolerances, even when they're within the thresholds set on the **General Ledger Setup** page. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assumes that  the Apply to Oldest setting indicates that the customer (or you as a customer of your vendor) has an account with you where they regularly pay the balance. Therefore, remaining amounts shouldn't be removed by posting a payment tolerance entry.

11. On the **Change Payment Tolerance** page, fill in the **Payment Tolerance %** and **Max Pmt. Tolerance Amount** fields, and then choose the **OK** button.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You have now set up tolerance for local currency only. If you want [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to handle tolerance on payments, credit memos, and refunds in a foreign currency, you must run the **Change Payment Tolerance** batch job with a value in the **Currency Code** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To get a payment tolerance warning every time that you post an application in the tolerance, you must activate the payment tolerance warning. For more information, see [To enable or disable payment tolerance warning](finance-payment-tolerance-and-payment-discount-tolerance.md#to-enable-or-disable-payment-tolerance-warnings) section.  
>
> To deactivate tolerance for a customer or vendor, block tolerances on the relevant customer or vendor card. For more information, see [To block payment tolerance for customers](finance-payment-tolerance-and-payment-discount-tolerance.md#to-block-payment-tolerance-for-customers).  
>
> When you set up tolerance, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also checks if there are any open entries and calculates the tolerance for these entries.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you enable the **Adjust for Payment Discount** field on the **VAT Posting Setup** page, the VAT amount is considered as it relates to the **Payment Tolerances** and **Payment Discounts** amounts, and VAT will be reduced for both of transaction amounts if they exist. The system can't be configured to use VAT reducing only for one type of transaction.  

## To enable or disable payment tolerance warnings

The payment tolerance warning appears when you post an application that has a balance in the allowed tolerance. You can then choose how you want to post and document the balance.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, on the **Application** FastTab, turn on the **Payment Tolerance Warning** toggle to activate the warning. To deactivate the warning, turn off the toggle.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The default option for the **Payment Tolerance Warning** page is **Leave the Balance as Remaining Amount**. The default option for the **Payment Discount Tolerance Warning** page the is **Do Not Accept the Late Payment Discount**.

## To block payment tolerance for customers

The default setting for payment tolerance is allowed. To disallow a certain customer or vendor payment tolerance, block the tolerance on the respective customer or vendor card. The following steps describe how to do it for a customer. The steps are similar for a vendor.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer** or **Vendor**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Payments** FastTab, select the **Block Payment Tolerance** check box.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the customer or vendor has open entries, you must first remove payment tolerance from entries that are currently open.

## Example 1 - Tolerance calculations for a single document

The following are some example scenarios showing the expected tolerance calculations and postings occurring in different situations.  

The **G/L Setup** page contains the following setup:

- Payment Discount Grace Period: 5D  
- Max Payment Tolerance: 5  

Scenarios with alternative A or B represent:  

- **A** In this case, the payment discount tolerance warning is turned off, or the user has the warning on and chose to allow the late payment discount (Post the Balance as Payment Tolerance).  
- **B** In this case, the user has the warning on and chose not to allow the late payment discount (Leave the Balance as Remaining Amount).

(2) If payment falls in these ranges, all application entries can't be closed, even with tolerance.  

#### (2) Payment Date is between 01/16/03 and 01/20/03 (Scenarios 4-9)

Remaining Amount per  

Normal Application Rules  

![Single payment tolerance rules 2.](media/singlePmtTolRules_GracePeriod.gif "Single payment tolerance rules 2")  

(1) If payment falls in these ranges, all application entries can be closed with or without tolerance.  

(2) If payment falls in these ranges, all application entries can't be closed, even with tolerance.  

#### (3) Payment Date is after 01/20/03 (Scenarios 10-15)

Remaining Amount per  

Normal Application Rules  

![Single payment tolerance rules 3.](media/singlePmtTolRules_Post0120.gif "Single payment tolerance rules 3")  

(1) If payment falls in these ranges, all application entries can be closed with or without tolerance.  

(2) If payment falls in these ranges, all application entries can't be closed even with tolerance.  

## Example 2 - Tolerance calculations for multiple documents

The following are some example scenarios showing the expected tolerance calculations and postings occurring in different situations. The examples are limited to scenarios that result in all entries in the application being closed.  

The **G/L Setup** page contains the following setup:
- Payment Discount Grace Period 5D  
- Max Payment Tolerance 5  

Scenarios with alternative A, B, C, or D represent the following:  

- **A** In this case the payment discount tolerance warning is turned off, or the user has the warning on and chose to allow the late payment discount (Post as Tolerance) in any invoice.  
- **B** In this case, the user has the warning on and chose not to allow the late payment discount on any invoice.  
- **C** - In this case, the user has the warning on and chose to allow the late payment discount on the first invoice but not the second.  
- **D** - In this case, the user has the warning on and chose not to allow the late payment discount on the first invoice but allowed it on the second.

# Inventory by Serial No. (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

If you track items by serial numbers, the **Inventory by Serial No.** report shows your total inventory per serial number. Use this report to track the performance of items on a serial by serial basis.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/inventory-by-serial-no.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inventory by Serial No Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/inventory-by-serial-no.png":::

## Use the report

Inventory management and warehousing staff use this report to track inventory per serial number.

Inventory managers use the report to optimize stock levels for each serial number. This information can help identify slow moving inventory, so you can take corrective action. It can also help you find serial numbers that are due to expire.

The report gives warehouse staff a clear picture of the quantities of each serial number, so you can manage inventory efficiently and avoid stock-outs.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Inventory by Serial No.* report includes the following KPIs:

- [**Quantity**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#quantity)
- [**Inventory (Quantity)**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#inventory-quantity)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)] 


## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Item
- Item Ledger Entries

# Use time sheets

This article describes how to use time sheets to track absence, and to track time and resources that are spent on a project. Tracking time helps you identify issues early and avoid delays or cost overruns. Time sheets make it easy for a resource to report time usage for an individual or a machine so that managers can review the usage and its allocation.

You can copy and use your project planning lines in a time sheet. In that way, you must only enter the information in one place and the line information is always correct. To learn more, go to [To copy project planning lines to a time sheet](#copy-project-planning-lines-to-a-time-sheet).

After you approve time sheet entries for a project, you can post them to the relevant project journal or resource journal. To learn more, go to [To post time sheet lines in a project journal](#post-time-sheet-lines-in-a-project-journal) and [To post time sheet lines in a resource journal](#post-time-sheet-lines-in-a-resource-journal).

Before you can use time sheets, you must set up general information and specify an administrator and one or more approvers of time sheets. To learn more about setting up time sheets, go to [Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).  

> [!TIP]
> You can use time sheets on a mobile device. To do that, you might have to turn on the **Use New Time Sheet Experience** toggle on the [Resources Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=462) page.

## Create time sheets

You can use the **Create Time Sheets** page to set up time sheets for a specified number of time periods or weeks. Then, the time sheet owner can open it and record time spent on a task. You can also [schedule the batch job to run automatically](ui-work-report.md#ScheduleReport).  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must have permissions to create time sheets. To learn more about permissions, go to [Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also use the **Create Time Sheets** action on the **Resources** list page and the **Resource Card** page.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Before you create time sheets for a resource, make sure that the **Use Time Sheet** and **Time Sheet Owner User ID** fields are specified for them on the **Resource Card** page.

    Optionally, choose the **Schedule** action to specify how often to automatically run the task. For example, to configure the task to run weekly for four weeks, on the **Schedule a Report - Create Time Sheets** page, in the **Next Run Date Formula** field, enter **4W**. To learn more about how to schedule reports, go to [Scheduling a Report to Run](ui-work-report.md#ScheduleReport).  

You can view the time sheets that you create on the **Time Sheets** page. Each time sheet consists of one or more lines that define the time that you want to submit for approval. The following table describes the types of lines that you can add to the time sheet.

| **Field** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| | Use to add a note or marker in the **Description** field of the time sheet line. For example, you can use this field to categorize time sheet entries. If you leave the **Type** field empty for a time sheet line, you can't enter time values in the weekday fields for that line. |
| Absence | Use to register the time you're absent during a work week. To complete the information for the line, specify the type of absence in the **Cause of Absence Code** field. |
| Assembly Order | Used to register time for assembly orders. A time sheet line of this type is created while posting assembly order lines for which the resource is set up to use time sheets. You can't manually select a line of this type. |
| Project | Use to register time usage for a project. To complete the information for the line, specify the project number and the project task number for which you want to register time. You can register time for lines that aren't scheduled.|
| Resource | Use to register time usage for a resource. To complete the information for the line, provide a description of the work. |
| Service | Use to register time usage for a service order or service credit memo. |

For example, you want to submit a time sheet for a week where you did cleaning tasks and had a day off for a medical appointment. The following table shows how you would add lines to the time sheet.

| Type | Description | Work Type Code | Absence Type Code |
|--|--|--|--|
| Resource | Work hours | Cleaning |  |
| Absence | Time off |  | Health |
|  | I had to take off Tuesday due to a medical appointment. |  |  |

In this example, you can then register the hours across the relevant days for each workday.  

> [!TIP]
> In most cases, companies have predefined work types for the various types of lines. You just choose the relevant work type from the list, and then add a description.  
>
> Choose the work type by choosing:
>
> * The :::image type="icon" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" border="false"::: button in the **Description** field, or by selecting the field and pressing **F8**.
> * The **Activity Details** action and then specifying it in the page that opens.
> * The **Work Type Code** field or the **Absence Type Code** field, respectively. In this case, you can ignore the [To define work types and add one to a time sheet](#define-work-types-and-add-one-to-a-time-sheet) section.  

## Reuse time sheet lines in other time sheets

If your time sheet information remains the same from time period to time period, copy the lines from the previous time period to save time. Then, just enter your time usage for the new period.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the time sheet for a period later than the period for an existing time sheet with lines.  
3. Use the following actions to specify what to copy:

   * To copy only the lines, choose the **Copy lines from time sheet** action.
   * To copy the lines and comments, choose **Copy lines from time sheet with comments** action.

The lines are copied, including details such as type and description. For example, if the line is related to a project, the **Project No.** is copied. All copied lines have the status **Open**. You can modify the lines as needed.

## Copy project planning lines to a time sheet

The following procedure describes how to quickly add project planning lines to a time sheet.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Time Sheets** page, select a time sheet for the relevant time period.  
3. Choose the **Create lines from project planning** action. Any project planning lines in the time sheet time period are copied to the time sheet for the person or machine in the **Resource No.** field on the time sheet.

## Define work types and add one to a time sheet

You can define the work type for all-time sheet lines for service orders, project orders, and resources. In this way, you can add information that you need to bill the customer for different types of work.  

1. On the **Time Sheets** page, choose the relevant time sheet.
2. On the first of the lines in the **Lines** section, choose the **Type** field, and then choose the relevant type, such as *Resource*.  
3. Choose the **Description** field, and then, in the **Time Sheet Line Resource Detail** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
    1. If no work types exist, choose the **New** action.
    2. On the **Work Types** page, fill in the fields as necessary, and then return to the time sheet.
4. Fill in the rest of the time sheet. Learn more in the [To fill in time sheet lines and submit for approval](#fill-in-time-sheet-lines-and-submit-for-approval) section.  

> [!TIP]
> You can follow similar steps to define absence codes.

## Fill in time sheet lines and submit for approval

Time sheet registration is tracked in hours, the standard base unit of measure for resources. By default, a time sheet shows the common work days of Monday through Friday.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a time sheet for the relevant period.
3. Fill in the fields on a line as necessary. Enter the number of hours used by the resource on each day of the week.  

    In most cases, to track work, you add a line of type **Resource**, and then register hours spent each day. If you want to register absence, add a line of type **Absence**.  

    > [!TIP]  
    > You can review the sum of time sheet hours entered in the **Actual/Budgeted Summary** FactBox.  
4. Repeat step 3 for other work types that the resource performs.  

    Next, decide whether to submit all, or selected, lines on the time sheet.  

    * To submit the time sheet for one or more lines, choose the relevant line, and then choose the **Submit** action.

        On the submission page, choose the **Selected lines only** option. The state of the line changes from **Open** to **Submitted**.
    * To submit the time sheet for all open lines, choose the **Submit** action at the top of the **Time Sheet** page.  

        Confirm that you want to submit all open lines on the current time sheet.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You can only submit time sheet lines for which you entered time.  
5. To modify information on a line that is set to **Submitted**, select the line, and then choose the **Reopen** action.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > A manager might reject a time sheet line that is submitted for approval. If a line has the status **Rejected**, you can make changes to the line, and then choose **Submit** again.  
6. Choose the **OK** button.

## Approve or reject a time sheet

A time sheet must be submitted for approval before it can be used. You can approve and reject individual lines on a time sheet or send them back to the submitter. You approve a time sheet in two ways:

* A time sheet administrator can approve any time sheet.
* The person who is specified in the **Time Sheet Approver User ID** field on a resource card can approve that resource's time sheets. To learn more about setting up approval, go to [Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Manager Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a time sheet from the list.  
3. On the **Time Sheet** page:
    1. Choose the **Process** action, then choose the **Approve** action.
    2. Choose the **All submitted lines** action to approve all lines or the **Selected lines only** action to approve only the lines that are selected on the **Time Sheet** page.
4. Choose the **OK** button.  
5. Alternatively, choose the **Reject** action.  

> [!TIP]  
> Use the **Time Sheet Status** and **Actual/Budgeted Summary** FactBoxes to get an overview of time sheet information.

After you approve or reject a time sheet, if you want to update it you must reopen it. The following procedure explains how to reopen an approved or rejected time sheet.

## Reopen a time sheet

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Manager Time Sheets** or **Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a time sheet from the list.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You can only reopen lines with the status **Approved**. You can't reopen lines with the status **Rejected** or that are posted.  
3. On the **Time Sheet** page, choose the **Reopen** action, and then choose the **All submitted lines** action to reopen all lines, or the **Selected lines only** action to reopen only the lines that are selected on the **Time Sheet** page.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The status of the time sheets line or lines is changes to **Submitted**.  

## View and approve time sheets by project

On a project, you can specify a person who is responsible for the project. That information is linked to time sheet lines. The link gives project managers a list of the time sheets to approve. For example, the team's project manager might be responsible for certain projects in your company. In that case, the manager should be designated as the **Person Responsible** on the Project Card page. This view of time sheet information shows the project tasks associated with a project and the quantity of hours used.

> [!NOTE]
> To approve time sheets on the **Manager Time Sheet by Project** page, you must first select a **Time Sheet by Project Approval** option in the **Resources Setup** page. To learn how to set up approvals for resources, go to [Set Up Resources](projects-how-setup-resources.md).

### Approve or reject a time sheet by project

Posting groups map entities to general ledger accounts. Examples of entities are customers, vendors, items, resources, and sales and purchase documents. Posting groups save time and help avoid mistakes when you post transactions. The transaction values go to the accounts specified in the posting group for that particular entity. The only requirement is that you have a chart of accounts. For more information, see [Set Up the Chart of Accounts](finance-setup-chart-accounts.md).  

Posting groups are covered under three umbrellas:  

* General

  Define who you sell to and buy from, and what you sell and what you buy. You can also combine groups to specify things like the income statement accounts to post to, or use groups to filter reports.  
* Specific

  Use sales documents, for example, instead of posting directly to the general ledger. When you create entries in the customer ledger, corresponding entries are made in the general ledger.  
* Tax

  Define the tax percentages and calculation types that apply to who you sell to and buy from, and what you sell and what you buy.

The following sections describe the posting groups under each umbrella.  

## General posting groups

The following table describes the general posting groups.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| General Business Posting Groups |Assign this group to customers and vendors to specify who you sell to, and who you buy from. Set up these posting groups on the **Gen. Business Posting Groups** page. When you do, think about how many groups you need to break down sales and purchases. For example, group customers and vendors by geographical area, or by the type of business. |
| General Product Posting Groups |Assign this group to items and resources to specify what you sell, and what you buy. Set up these posting groups on the **Gen. Product Posting Groups** page. When you do, consider the number of groups you need to break down sales by product (items and resources) and purchases by items. For example, divide these groups by raw materials, retail, resources, capacity, and so on. |
| General Posting Setups |Combine business and product posting groups and choose the accounts to post to. For each combination of business and product posting groups, you can assign a set of general ledger accounts. For example, you can post the sale of the same item to different general ledger accounts because customers are assigned to different business posting groups. Set these configurations up on the **General Posting Setup** page. |

## Specific posting groups

The following table describes the posting groups that are specific to types of data.

|Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Customer Posting Groups |Define the accounts to use when you post accounts receivable transactions. If you use inventory with receivables, the accounts that the sales order lines post to are determined by the general business posting group assigned to your customer, and the general product posting group assigned to the inventory item. See *General Business Posting Groups* and *General Product Posting Groups* in the [General posting groups](#general-posting-groups) section. Set up these posting groups on the **Customer Posting Groups** page. |
| Vendor Posting Groups |Define where to post transactions for payables accounts, service charge accounts, and payment discount accounts. This is similar to customer posting groups. Set up these posting groups on the **Vendor Posting Groups** page. |
| Inventory Posting Groups |Define inventory posting groups that you then assign to the relevant item accounts on the **Inventory Posting Setup** page. This way, when you post entries concerning an item, the system posts to the G/L account that is set up for the combination of inventory posting group and location that is linked to the item. Inventory posting groups also provide a good way to organize your inventory, so you can separate items by their posting group when you generate reports. Set up these posting groups on the **Inventory Posting Groups** page. |
| Bank Account Posting Groups |Define the general ledger accounts that bank account entries are posted to. For example, this can simplify the processes of tracing transactions and reconciling bank accounts. Set up these posting groups on the **Bank Account Posting Groups** page. We recommend that these G/L accounts have the **Direct Posting** field set to *No*. |
| Fixed Assets Posting Groups |Define accounts for different types of expenses and costs, such as acquisition costs, accumulated depreciation amounts, acquisition costs on disposal, accumulated depreciation on disposal, gains on disposal, losses on disposal, maintenance expenses, and depreciation expenses. Set up these posting groups on the **FA Posting Groups** page. |

### Allow substitute customer or vendor posting groups on documents

You can let people choose other customer and vendor posting groups than the default groups when they're working with sales or purchase documents and journals.

To allow changes to customer posting groups, choose **Allow Multiple Posting Groups** on the **Sales & Receivable Setup** and **Service Mgt. Setup** pages, and the **Purchase & Payables Setup** page for vendor posting group changes.

On the **Customer Posting Groups** or **Vendor Posting Groups** pages, you can specify the posting groups to allow as substitutes by choosing **Substitutions**. Substitute posting groups can replace the default customer or vendor posting groups specified for a customer or vendor.

After you set this up, you can choose from the allowed substitute posting groups and change the customer or vendor posting group when posting sales or purchase documents and journals. The substitute customer or vendor posting groups are copied to posted documents and journals, and payable or receivable G/L entries are posted to the G/L accounts specified for the substitutes.

When applying, for example, an invoice and payment that are posted with different customer or vendor posting groups (different G/L accounts), [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] transfers the amounts between the G/L accounts to balance them.

## Tax posting groups

The following table describes the tax-related posting groups.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Tax Business Posting Groups |Determine how to calculate and post sales tax for customers and vendors. Set up these posting groups on the **Tax Business Posting Groups** page. When you do, think about how many groups you need. For example, it might depend on factors like local legislation, and whether you trade both domestically and internationally. |
| Tax Product Posting Groups |Indicate the tax calculations needed for the types of items or resources you buy or sell. |
| Tax Posting Setup |Combine tax business posting groups and tax product posting groups. When you fill in a general journal line, purchase line, or sales line, we look at the combination to identify the accounts to use. |

If your country/region uses value-added tax (VAT), see [Set Up Calculations and Posting Methods for Value-Added Tax](finance-setup-vat.md).  

## Example of linking posting groups

Here's a scenario.  

These posting groups are chosen on the customer card:  

* General business posting group
* Customer posting group  

These posting groups are chosen on the item card:  

* General product posting group  
* Inventory posting group  

When you create a sales document, the sales header uses the customer card information, and the sales lines use the item card information.  

* The revenue posting (income statement) is determined by the combination of the general business posting group and the general product posting group.  
* The accounts receivable posting (balance sheet) is determined by the customer posting group.  
* The inventory posting (balance sheet) is determined by the inventory posting group.  
* The cost of goods sold posting (income statement) is determined by the combination of general business posting group and general product posting group.  

Your setup determines when posting happens. For example, the timing is affected by when you do periodic activities, such as posting inventory cost or adjusting cost item entries.

## Copy posting setup lines

The more product and business posting groups you have, the more lines you'll have on the **General Posting Setup** page. While there might be many different combinations of business and product posting groups, different combinations might still post to the same general ledger accounts. To limit the amount of manual entry, copy the general ledger accounts from an existing line on the **General Posting Setup** page.

## Set up posting groups on the go

To get users started faster, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can show notifications of missing G/L accounts in various posting group setups. To get these notifications, make sure that the **G/L Account is missing in posting group or setup** notification is selected in the **My Notifications** page, which you can access from the **Change when I receive notifications** field in the **My Settings** page.  

This way, when you work on a document that uses a posting group or a setup that is missing a required general ledger account, you get a notification. Choose the link in the notification to open a page where you can make the relevant changes, provided you have permission to do so.  

> [!NOTE]
> In order to take you directly to the posting group or setup that is missing a general ledger account, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will create a placeholder posting group or setup. Posting groups and setups are a way for the accountant to control how entries are posted to the general ledger, so such the just-in-time creation of posting groups and setups might not be allowed in your organization.  
>
> In that case, disable the *G/L Account is missing in posting group or setup* notification, and then work with your accountant to make the relevant changes to the posting group, setup, or your document. This is an important step, because after documents are posted, you can't delete incorrectly used posting groups or setups because general ledger entries are created for them.

Use the **Blocked** field in the **General Posting Setup** page to prevent users from mistakenly using a setup that is no longer relevant for new postings. 

## Access all fields and accounts when you set up a posting group  

Posting groups can be complex to set up. Because some types of accounts aren't frequently used, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't show them as columns on the lines. Also, to make it a bit easier to choose the right accounts, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] filters the accounts that you can choose in field lookups. 

If you want to access all accounts on the lines and in the field lookups, there are a couple of settings that can help:

* To show all accounts as columns on the lines, turn on the **Show All Accounts** toggle.
* On individual lines, to access all accounts in the field lookups, choose the **View All Accounts on Lookup** checkbox.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Show All Accounts** toggle might not seem to work on the **General Posting Setup** page. That's because [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always shows all accounts as columns on the lines on that page.

## Troubleshooting posting group errors

Posting groups are one of the more advanced concepts to set up in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If they aren't set up correctly, errors can occur when posting documents or journal lines. For example, these errors are typically caused by a mistake in how general ledger accounts are assigned, or how posting groups are combined.

When something is wrong, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will display the **Error Messages** page. The **Error Messages** page can make it easier to identify and resolve the issue. The page offers a description of the error that points out the posting group setup that needs attention. For example, the message might read "Sales Prepayment account is missing a General Posting Setup." There's also a link to open the page that's the source of the issue, so you can quickly resolve it.  

> [!NOTE]
> The error handling described above is not available on item, resource, employee, and fixed asset journals, or for G/L accounts added in local versions of posting groups.

## Audit changes to posting groups

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your posting group setup. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)]

The following table lists the table for posting group and their IDs.

| Table | Table ID |
| ----- | -------- |
| Gen. Product Posting Group | 251 |
| Customer Posting Group | 92 |
| Inventory Posting Group | 94 |
| FA Posting Group | 5606 |
| Vendor Posting Group | 93 |

# Accessibility and Keyboard Shortcuts

This article provides information about the features that make [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] readily available to people with disabilities. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the following accessibility features:  

- Keyboard shortcuts. See [Keyboard Shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md).
- Touch and pen gestures on tablets and phones. See [Touch and Pen Gestures](touch-gestures.md).
- Navigation  
- Headings  
- Alternative text for images and links  
- Support for common assistive technologies 
- Zoom in or out on any page
- Tooltips on elements in the user interface

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## <a name="Navigation"></a> Navigation
  
You can use different combinations of the Tab, Shift, and arrow keys of your keyboard to move between elements on a page. Elements include actions, fields and columns, parts, and other controls. In general, select <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to move to the next or previous element.

When you focus on an area that contains actions, like the navigation bar on the top of role center or action bar on other pages, use the arrows keys to move through the different actions and groups. Select <kbd>Enter</kbd> on a group to open its underlying actions, and then continue using the arrows keys. Select <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to move out of the action area.

By using the tab order, you can also switch between the main browser page and dialog boxes that request confirmation, for example, or the sign-in page.  

## <a name="Headings"></a> Headings in Content

The HTML source for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] content uses tags to help users of assistive technology to understand the structure and content of the page. For example, on list pages, the columns are defined in TH tags and the column headings are set with TITLE attribute inside the tag. Captions for elements, such as FastTabs, FactBoxes, and fields are included in heading tags (H1, H2, H3, and H4).  

## <a name="Images"></a> Image and Links

A descriptive text for images is set with the ALT attribute inside the IMG tag. A descriptive text for hyperlinks is set with the title attribute inside the A tag.  

## <a name="AssistiveTech"></a> Assistive Technologies

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports various assistive technologies, such as high contrast, screen readers, and voice recognition software. Some assistive technologies may not work well with certain elements in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] pages.  

## <a name="zoom"></a> Zoom

Most browsers use standard keyboard shortcuts to zoom in and out on the current page. These keyboard shortcuts aren't specific to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], but they work when you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a browser. For a list of supported keyboard shortcuts, see [Keyboard Shortcuts for Zooming In and Out](keyboard-shortcuts.md#zoomshortcuts).

## Tooltips

Tooltips are available on most elements in the user interface, like page fields and columns, actions, cues tiles, and charts. A tooltip provides extra text that explains an element to help you better understand its purpose. 

Tooltips are accessed in different ways, depending on the client (web or mobile) and the device that you're working with. Use the following table as a guide. Some tooltips can be read by screen-readers. In this case, you access the tooltips as described in the table, then use the screen reader to navigate to the tooltip as you would with any other element.

#### Accessing tooltips

|Element|Mouse action for web client|Keyboard shortcut for web client|Touch gesture on tablet/phone for mobile app|Screen reader support|
|-------|-----------------|------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
|Page fields and column headings|Hover over or click the field caption or column heading|Move focus to the field or column heading, and select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> keys|Tap the field caption |yes|
|Charts elements, like a bar, line, pie slice|Hover over the element|Move focus to element, for example, by using arrow keys|Tap and hold the element|yes|
|Actions|Hover over the action|none|none |no|
|Cue tiles|Hover over the tile |none|none|no|


<!--
- With a mouse, hover over the element.
- With keyboard, press the Alt+Up Arrow keys.
- On a tablet or phone, tap and hold on the element. To learn about more gestures, see [Touch and Pen Gestures](touch-gestures.md)

# Scheduling a Synchronization between Business Central and Dataverse

You can synchronize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] on scheduled intervals by setting up jobs in the job queue. The synchronization jobs synchronize data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] records that are coupled. For records that are not already coupled, depending on the synchronization direction and rules, the synchronization jobs can create and couple new records in the destination system.

There are several synchronization jobs that are available out-of-the-box. The jobs are run in the following order to avoid coupling dependencies between tables. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

1. CURRENCY - Common Data Service synchronization job.
2. VENDOR - Common Data Service synchronization job.
3. CONTACT - Common Data Service synchronization job.
4. CUSTOMER - Common Data Service synchronization job.
5. SALESPEOPLE - Common Data Service synchronization job.

You can view the jobs on the **Job Queue Entries** page. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## Default synchronization job queue entries

The following table describes the default synchronization jobs for [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  

| Job Queue Entry | Description | Direction | Integration Table Mapping | Default Synchronization Frequency (mins) | Default inactivity sleep time (mins) |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| CONTACT - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contacts with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts. | Bidirectional | CONTACT | 30 | 720 <br>(12 hours) |
| CURRENCY - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] transaction currencies with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] currencies. | From [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] | CURRENCY | 30 | 720 <br> (12 hrs) |
| CUSTOMER - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] accounts with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers. | Bidirectional | CUSTOMER | 30 | 720<br> (12 hrs) |
| VENDOR - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] accounts with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers. | Bidirectional | VENDOR | 30 | 720<br> (12 hrs) |
| SALESPEOPLE - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] salespeople with [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] users. | From [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | SALESPEOPLE | 30 | 1440<br> (24 hrs) |

## Synchronization process

Each synchronization job queue entry uses a specific integration table mapping that specifies which [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table to synchronize. The table mappings also include some settings that control which records in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table to synchronize.  

To synchronize data, [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table records must be coupled to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records. For example, a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customer must be coupled to a [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account. You can set up couplings manually, before running the synchronization jobs, or let the synchronization jobs set up couplings automatically. The following list describes how data is synchronized between [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when you are using the synchronization job queue entries. For more information, see [Couple and Synchronize Records Manually](admin-how-to-couple-and-synchronize-records-manually.md).

- The **Sync. Only Coupled Records** check box controls whether new records are created when you synchronize. By default, the check box is selected, which means that only records that are coupled will be synchronized. In the integration table mapping, you can change the table mapping between a [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table and a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table so that the integration synchronization jobs will create new records in the destination database for each row in the source database that is not coupled. For more information, see [Creating New Records](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md#create-new-records).

    **Example**
    If you clear the **Sync. Only Coupled Records** check box, when you synchronize customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with accounts in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], a new account is created for each customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and automatically coupled. Additionally, because the synchronization is bidirectional in this case, a new customer is created and coupled for each [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account that is not already coupled.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > There are rules and filters that determine what data is synchronized. For more information, go to [Synchronization Rules](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md).

- When new records are created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the records use the either the template that is defined for the integration table mapping or the default template that is available for the row type. Fields are populated with data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] depending on the synchronization direction. For more information, see [Modify Table Mappings for Synchronization](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md).  

- With subsequent synchronizations, only records that have been modified or added after the last successful synchronization job for the table will be updated.  

     New records in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are added in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If data in fields in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] records has changed, the data is copied to the corresponding field in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

- With bidirectional synchronization, the job synchronizes from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], and then from [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## About inactivity timeouts

Some job queue entries, such as those that schedule synchronization between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], use the **Inactivity Timeout** field on the **Job Queue Entry** page to prevent the job queue entry from running unnecessarily.  

:::image type="content" source="media/on-hold-with-inactivity-timeout.png" alt-text="Flowchart for when job queue entries are put on hold due to inactivity.":::

When the value in this field is not zero, and the job queue did not find any changes during the last run, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] puts the job queue entry on hold. When that happens, the **Status of Job Queue** field will show **On Hold Due to Inactivity**, and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will wait for the period of time specified in **Inactivity Timeout** field before it runs the job queue entry again.  

For example, by default, the CURRENCY job queue entry, which synchronizes currencies in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with exchange rates in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], will look for changes to exchange rates every 30 minutes. If no changes are found, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] puts the CURRENCY job queue entry on hold for 720 minutes (twelve hours). If an exchange rate is changed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] while the job queue entry is on hold, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically reactivate the job queue entry and restart the job queue. 

> [!Note]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically activate job queue entries that are on hold only when changes happen in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Changes in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] will not activate job queue entries.

# Create Sales Opportunities
You can create opportunities for the sales opportunities you have on your contacts. All opportunities must be assigned to a salesperson or purchaser and must have a contact.

You can create opportunities from the **Opportunity List** page. But you typically will create opportunities from the specific contact or salespeople.

Before you can create opportunities, you must set up opportunity sales cycles. For more information see [Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Stages](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md).

## To create an opportunity from a salesperson
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Salespeople**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the salesperson from the list for whom you want to create an opportunity.
3. Choose the **Opportunities** action, and then choose **List**.

# Analyze general ledger (G/L) transactions

When a transaction is posted to the general ledger, the following data is stored in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database: a single row in the G/L register table and one or more rows in the G/L Entry table.

## Analyzing the G/L register

You can use the G/L Registers page for financial reporting and transaction tracking. The page gives you an overview of all transactions to the general ledger with the ability to navigate to related entries in subledgers, such as VAT entries or Customer Ledger Entries. You can also see which type of transaction that occured, the user who did the transaction and when it was recorded in the database.

The G/L Registers page is particularly useful during audits, as it provides auditors with easy access to related detailed transaction information. It helps identify any discrepancies, errors, or unusual entries that may require further investigation. 

## Example: use analysis mode to get an overview of G/L transaction types and volume

[!INCLUDE [gl-register-analysis-example](includes/gl-register-analysis-example.md)]


## Analyzing general ledger (G/L) entries

Depending on your need for details or aggregation when analyzing general ledger (G/L) entries, you have several options:

- use the G/L entries page in analysis mode. To learn more, go to [Ad-hoc analysis on finance data](ad-hoc-analysis-finance.md)  
- use the Chart of Accounts page to get a summary across all your G/L accounts. To learn more, go to [Analyze finance data from the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md).
- run or define a financial report. To learn more, go to [Primary capabilities of financial reporting](finance-financial-reporting-capabilities.md).

# Responsible AI FAQ for summarize (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Copilot’s summarize feature in Business Central.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is summarize?

Business Central users often need an overview of their data and what urgently needs their attention to decide how to proceed with their tasks optimally.

Microsoft Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that sparks creativity, boosts productivity, and eliminates tedious tasks. Copilot uses AI to generate an insightful summary of any record, making it effortless for people to learn what is important or urgent.

## What are the capabilities of summarize?

- A concise summary is displayed as a FactBox on most card and document pages in Business Central. It typically provides the top two or three insightful points as brief sentences.

- From the initial summary, users can select **Show more** to get more information about the record. The Copilot pane opens and generates additional points of interest.

- When any summary is displayed, Copilot makes it easy to review and learn about the facts referenced by the summary. These references are hyperlinked, so that users can quickly view or navigate to the source where they can explore details and take action.

While the summary text is AI-generated, each insight is grounded in factual data from Business Central. Copilot inherits the user's data permissions and can’t read any more data than the user already has access to.

## What is the intended use of summarize?

This feature helps people understand their business data, reduces the time it takes to sift through Business Central’s rich dataset, and makes Business Central easier to use. It isn't designed to make decisions on your behalf, provide recommendations, or advise on how to act or optimize your business.

Summaries don't automatically trigger actions on behalf of the user or the organization, and they don't persist to the database for other automated functions to use.

## How was summarize evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft in [Empowering responsible AI practices](https://aka.ms/RAI).

The feature underwent extensive AI testing using Business Central's demonstration data supplemented with extra, fictitious business data and volume data. Testing primarily covered various fields and pages from Business Central’s base application, with some testing also carried out on custom pages and fields. Copilot’s output was evaluated for accuracy of ranked insights, use of language, grounding of values in database data, and other metrics.

To ensure customer safety and data protection, this feature underwent rigorous testing to detect and deflect harmful content, jailbreaks, and other risks.

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content?

Microsoft has various automated systems to ensure that output from Copilot is of the highest quality. Automated systems also detect abuse and ensure safety for our customers and their data by filtering harmful content.

Microsoft might turn off Copilot features for specific customers if abuse is detected.
 
Users can provide feedback on every Copilot response and report inaccurate or inappropriate content to help Microsoft improve this feature. If you encounter inappropriate content, report it to Microsoft using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249810). We analyze user feedback and use it to improve responses.

You provide feedback by using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icons that are displayed alongside generated content.

## What are the AI limitations of summarize? How can users minimize the impact of the limitations when using the system?

- General AI limitations

  AI systems are valuable tools but they're nondeterministic. The content they generate might not be accurate. It's important to use your judgment
to review and verify responses before making decisions that could affect stakeholders like customers and partners.

- Geographic and language availability

  [!INCLUDE [copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only.md)]

- Certain industry, product, and subject limitations

  Organizations that operate in some business domains, such as medical, drugs, legal, and weapons, might experience lower quality or limited output from Copilot because of the sensitive nature of that domain.

- Summaries about people

  Summaries about people, such as customers, vendors, or employees in Business Central, might result in limited output from Copilot because of other safety mechanisms designed to reduce the risk of inaccuracies. Even though Copilot isn't designed to provide recommendations or conclusions about people, you should use your judgment to review and verify responses before making decisions.

## What data does summarize collect and how is it used?

Business Central collects the minimum data required for Microsoft to provide the service.

- Microsoft collects anonymized information about decisions made by Copilot and your interactions with the feature. It doesn't collect summary texts or other company data used or collected by Copilot to generate summaries.

- Microsoft doesn't use your business data to train the foundational models for the benefit of others. Learn more in [Dynamics 365 terms for Azure OpenAI-powered features](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2236010).

# Setting Up Manufacturing

To convert material into produced end items, production resources, such as bills of material, routings, machine operators, and machinery must be set up in the system.

Operators and machines are represented in the system as machine centers that may be organized in work centers and work center groups. When these resources are established, they can be loaded with operations according to the item's defined material (BOM) and process (routing) structure, and according to the capacity of the machine or work center. You can also set the production capacity of each resource. Capacity is defined by the work time available in the machine and work centers, and is governed by calendars for each level. A work center calendar specifies the working days or hours, shifts, holidays, and absence that determine the work center's gross available capacity (typically measured in minutes). All of this is determined by defined efficiency and capacity values.  

When you have set up manufacturing, you can plan and execute production orders. For more information, see [Planning](production-planning.md) and [Manufacturing](production-manage-manufacturing.md).  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Revalue inventory
If you want to appreciate or depreciate an item or a specific item ledger entry, you must use the revaluation journal.

## To revalue inventory
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Revaluation Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Calculate Inventory Value** action.
3. On the **Calculate Inventory Value** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **OK** button.
5. On each line on the **Item Revaluation Journals** page, in the **Unit Cost (Revalued)** field, enter the new unit cost. Alternatively, enter the new total amount in the **Inventory Value (Revalued)** field.

    The relevant fields are automatically updated. The **Amount** field shows the actual change in inventory value for the selected item ledger entry. It calculates the difference between the **Inventory Value (Calculated)** field and the **Inventory Value (Revalued)** field.
6. When you have completed all lines in the revaluation journal, choose the **Post** action.

New value entries are now created to reflect the revaluations that you have posted. You can see the new values on the respective item cards.

# Suggest number series with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how you can quickly generate number series in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with assistance from Copilot.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## Available languages

[!INCLUDE [copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability.md)]

## Prerequisites

- The suggest number series feature is activated. An administrator must complete this task. [Learn more about how to configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).
- You're familiar with number series in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Create number series](ui-create-number-series.md).

## About number series suggestions with Copilot

For each company you set up in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must assign unique identifiers to things like:

- General ledger accounts
- Customer and vendor accounts
- Invoices and other documents

Numbering isn't only important for identification. A well-designed numbering system also makes the company more manageable and easier to analyze, and can reduce data entry errors.

By letting you use natural language or structured input, Copilot can reduce the time it takes to set up number series and make it easier to maintain them. For example, when you need to update year or month-based numbering for many draft and posted documents in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Review the suggestions and refine your prompt

You can set up number series for one or more specific entities, such as items, or one or more feature areas (modules), such as Inventory, Finance, Sales, and Purchasing, and so on.

For specific entities, such as purchase orders, Copilot might also suggest blanket purchase orders and purchase return orders.

For feature areas, Copilot looks at the fields on the **Numbering** FastTab on the related setup page. For example, for Inventory, it looks at the FastTab on the **Inventory Setup** page. For Sales and Purchasing, it looks at the FastTab on the **Sales & Receivables** and **Purchases & Payables** pages. However, it also looks at related entities, which means it might suggest series for entities that aren't on the setup page. For example, when you create a series for Warehouse Management, Copilot might suggest a series for items.

We recommend that you carefully review the results and adjust your prompt to exclude unwanted series. For example, both the Warehouse and Inventory areas might suggest series for items. To avoid a conflict, you can exclude items in your prompt for one of those areas.

## Generate number series

Copilot can help you create and update number series on the **No. Series** page. The **Generate** action opens the **Generate No. Series with Copilot** dialog where you can enter a prompt.

To help you write the prompt, the Prompt Guide :::image type="content" source="media/prompt-guide-icon.png" alt-text="Show the Prompt Guide icon."::: button provides sets of prompts that you can use as-is, or as inspiration.

- Create entirely new number series.
- Change and update numbering in existing series.
- Create a new number series for the next year.

After you enter your prompt and choose **Generate**, Copilot creates proposals for one or more number series. You can review the proposals in the **No. Series Proposals** view. You can remove the proposals that you don't like, and edit the ones you do. When you're ready, you can choose **Keep it** to add or update a proposal. In addition, Copilot updates various setup pages with the number series you decided to keep.

## Examples of prompts

|Intent  |Prompt  |
|---------|---------|
|Create a number series that includes a year. For accountants, including a year on numbers for posted documents can make it easier to find hard copies in folders.     |Create contract credit memo number series. Make sure it includes the last two digits of the current year.         |
|Maintain number series and prepare for next year.     | Set up a contract credit memo number series in the service management module for the next year.        |
|Create number series in a completely empty company. This is where Copilot can save your hours, or even days, in new implementations.     | Create numbers series for the new company. Make sure all posted documents contain the last to digits of the current year.        |

# Merge duplicate records

Over time, as different people create new customers, vendors, or contacts, or you create new records during data migration, there's a risk that you duplicate records. If you find a duplicate, you can use the **Merge Duplicate** page from the card of the record that you want to keep. The page gives you an overview of duplicated field values and lets you select which values to keep or discard when you merge two records into one.

> [!NOTE]
> Only users with the MERGE DUPLICATES permission set can use this functionality.

> [!TIP]
> The **Merge Duplicate** page shows all fields where the values are different for the two records being compared. Therefore, if the page shows only a few fields, it might indicate a duplicate. If the page shows many fields, the record probably isn't a duplicate.

The following procedure is based on a customer card. The steps are similar for a vendor and contact cards.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the customer that you know or suspect that a duplicate record exists for, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **Customer Card** page, choose the **Merge With** action.
4. On the **Merge Duplicate** page, in the **Merge With** field, select the customer that you believe is a duplicate of the one you opened, which shows in the **Current** field.

    The **Fields** FastTab lists fields where the values are different for the two customers. This means that if the selected customer is really a duplicate, then only few fields should be listed, such as typing errors and other data entry mistakes.

    The **Related Tables** FastTab lists tables where there are fields with a relation to both customers. The **Current Count** and **Duplicate Count** fields show the number of fields in related tables where the **No.** value of both the current and the duplicate customer is used. On the **Merge Duplicate** page, this section is informational only. However, if there are merge conflicts, you can resolve them on the **Merge Duplicate Conflicts** page. Refer to steps 8 through 12.

5. For each field where you want to use another value than the current one, select the **Override** checkbox. The value in the **Alternate Value** field transfers to the current record when you complete the process.
6. After you specify the values to keep or override, choose the **Merge** action.

    [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks whether the merge of values for the duplicate customer into the current customer causes conflicts. A conflict exists if a value in at least one primary-key field is the same for both customers while the value in the **No** field is different for the two customers.

7. If no conflicts are found, choose the **Yes** button in the confirmation message.

    The duplicate customer is renamed so that all use of its **No.** value in all fields with relations to the customer table are replaced with the **No.** value of the current customer.
8. If conflicts exist, choose the **Resolve (xx) conflicts before merge** action on the **Conflicts** FastTab, which displays if conflicts exist.
9. On the **Merge Duplicate Conflicts** page, select the line for a related table with a conflict, and then choose the **View Details** action.

    The **Merge Duplicate** page now shows the fields in the selected table that cause a merge conflict between the two customer records. Notice in both the summarized values in the **Current** and **Conflicts With** fields and on the lines that at least one primary-key field is the same for both customers and the value of the **No.** field is different for the two customers.   
10. If you don't want to keep the duplicate customer record, choose the **Remove Duplicate** action, and then choose the **Close** button.

    Identical field values, other than the value in the **No.** field, are removed from the duplicate record and inserted on the current record.
11. If you want to keep the duplicate customer record after the merge,  choose the **Rename Duplicate**.
12. On lines, not for the **No.** field, where the field has the same value on both records, change the value in the **Alternate Value** field, and then choose the **Close** button.

    The conflicting field value is updated on the duplicate record so that it can be merged with the current record. The duplicate record continues to exist after the merge.
13. Repeat steps 8 through 12 until all conflicts are resolved. The **Conflicts** FastTab disappears.
14. On the **Merge Duplicate** page, choose the **Merge** action again, and then select the **Yes** button in the confirmation message box.

> [!NOTE]
> For contacts, you can use functionality to find duplicate contacts before you use the **Merge Duplicate** page. For more information, see [Search for duplicate contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md#search-for-duplicate-contacts).

# E-documents overview

Electronic documents (e-documents) are the backbone of modern business transactions. They encompass vital documents, such as invoices and receipts in both directions (delivery and receipt). They also add capabilities for document status–related messaging between access points.

Our commitment to enhancing your business processes led to the development of a groundbreaking app that focuses on e-documents in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. This app serves as a robust platform for efficient e-document management.

> [!NOTE]
> To use these capabilities, install the E-Document Core app in your environment.  

The E-Document app can be used in countries/regions where companies require specialized e-document handling to comply with local regulations. The app provides a solid foundation that can be easily extended to meet specific local or industry requirements.

The documentation explains e-documents in detail. It shows the capabilities of the app and demonstrates how it seamlessly adapts to cater to your organization's unique needs. To get started with e-documents, see the following articles.

# Troubleshooting Your Company Hub

Adding companies to the company hub dashboard is easy enough, but this article addresses issues that you may have on the way.  

## Check errors

Use the **Check Errors** action to view a list of recent errors. You can see additional details for each error, and you can clean up the log by deleting older entries.  

## Connection failed

There can be a couple of reasons why you cannot connect to a company, including the following:

- The URL in the **Environment Link** field is not valid  

  Go to the **Environment Links** page, open the environment that you cannot connect to, and then choose the **Test the connection** action.  
- The client's company is currently offline, for example if it being upgraded

  In your dashboard, choose the **Tools** menu item, and then choose **Check Errors**. This opens a list with technical details, so you might want to contact your administrator if you're seeing errors. For example, the error message "*The server has rejected the client credentials*" suggests that you do not have access.  
- You do not have access to all companies in the environment that you are trying to connect to

  In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an organization can have multiple business units called companies, and you might not have access to all companies. Work with your administrator or client to make sure that you have access to the companies that you have to work in.  

## Data does not refresh

When you add a company or request a refresh of the data, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fetches the data. But you must refresh the page yourself, such as choosing the **Reload all companies** action, refresh the browser page, navigate away from the dashboard and then back again, or similar.  

If you've added a company but it is not displaying in the list, you can also use the **Reload all companies** action to update the list.

# Power BI integration component and architecture overview

In this article, you'll learn about the different aspects of Power BI integration with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to help you understand its implementation and use.

## Components

The following table describes the major components involved with Power BI integration.

|Component|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|Power BI|A cloud-based report hosting and management service.|
|Power BI Desktop|An authoring tool for building reports and dashboards, and allows you to run reports. It's available as a free download on Microsoft Store and is installed locally.|
|[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]|Online or on-premises solution with connectors exposed to Power BI and the ability to embed a Power BI part.|

## What's available from the start

The following table describes available features.

|Feature|[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online or on-premises support|
|-------|---------------------|
|Power BI connectors|Both. Different connectors for online and on-premises. Same connector used for Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service |
|Embedded experience for viewing a given report inside a FactBox in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]|Both. Requires configuration to display reports for on-premises.|
|Power BI report management from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]|Online|
|Default Power BI reports on role centers deployed to Power BI|Online|
|Power BI Apps on Microsoft AppSource|Online|

## Architecture

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] integrates with Power BI through a connector using OData. The data source for Power BI reports is exposed as API pages and OData web services.

:::image type="content" source="./media/power-bi-architecture.svg" alt-text="Image alt text." lightbox="./media/power-bi-architecture.svg":::

Starting in February 2022, Power BI reports for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online are sourced from a secondary, read-only database replica. The database replica is part of the [read scale-out](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/database-read-scale-out-overview) capability in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. This configuration frees up the main database for transactions, which enhances performance of the system. Connecting to the read-only database replica is an integral part of the Business Central online connector, and requires no extra setup on your part. All new reports will connect to the read-only database replica by default. Old reports will still use the main database. For more information, see [Business Central 2021 Release Wave 2 Plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/smb/dynamics365-business-central/use-secondary-read-only-database-power-bi-reporting).

## General Flow

The following diagram illustrates the basic workflow for users when connecting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to Power BI.

![Power BI workflow  for integration with Business Central.](./media/power-bi-flow-v2.svg)

1. User signs up for a Power BI account.
2. User connects to Power BI from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
3. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the license.
4. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] deploys default reports to the Power BI service. This step only happens for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online.
5. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes reports in Power BI available for selection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Default reports are automatically displayed in Power BI parts.
6. User creates a report in Power BI Desktop.
7. User publishes the report to the Power BI service. The reports are then available for selection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# Flush components according to operation output

You can define different flushing strategies to automate the registration of consumption of components.

This feature is useful for the following reasons:  

- **Inventory Valuation**

    Value entries for output and consumption are created in parallel as the production order progresses. Without routing link codes, the inventory value increases as output is posted and decreases later when you post the consumption with the finished production order.  
- **Inventory Availability**

    With gradual consumption posting, the availability of component items is more up-to-date, which is important to maintain the internal balance between demand and supply. Without routing link codes, other demands for the component might believe that it's available as long as it's pending a delayed consumption posting.  
- **Just-in-Time**

    With the ability to customize products to customer requests, you can minimize waste by making sure that work and system changes only occur when it's necessary.  

- **Reduce data entry**

    The ability to automatically flush an operation lets you automate the entire process of recording consumption and output. The disadvantage of using automatic flushing is that you might not accurately record, or even be aware of, scrap.

## Automatic consumption posting (flushing) methods  

- Forward Flush the Entire Order  
- Forward Flushing by Operation  
- Back Flushing by Operation  
- Back Flushing the Entire Order  

### Forward flush an entire order  

Forward flushing a production order at the start of the job is similar to a manual consumption. The significant difference is that consumption happens automatically.  

- The entire contents of the production BOM are consumed and deducted from inventory at the time the released production order is refreshed.  
- The consumption quantity is the quantity per assembly stated on the production BOM, multiplied by the number of parent items you're building.  
- There's no need to record any information in the consumption journal if all of the items are to be flushed.  
- When you consume items from inventory, it doesn't matter when output journal entries are made because the output journal has no effect on this mode of consumption posting.  
- No routing link codes can be set.  

Forward flushing an entire order is suited in production environments with:  

- A low number of defects.  
- A low number of operations.  
- High component consumption in early operations.  

### Forward flushing by operation  

Flushing by operation allows you to deduct inventory during a specific operation in the routing of the parent item. Material is tied to the routing using routing link codes, which correspond to routing link codes applied to components in the production BOM.  

The flush takes place when the operation that has the same routing link code is started. Started means that some activity is recorded in the output journal for that operation. And that activity might just be that a setup time is entered.  

The amount of the flush is for the quantity per assembly on the production BOM multiplied by the number of parent items you're building (expected quantity).  

This technique is best employed when there are many operations and certain components aren't needed until late in the assembly sequence. In fact, a Just-in-Time (JIT) setup might not even have the items on hand when the RPO is begun.  

Material can be consumed during operations by using routing link codes. Some components might not be used until final assembly operations and shouldn't be withdrawn from stock until that time.  

### Back flushing by operation  

Back flushing by operation records consumption after the operation is posted in the output journal.  

The advantage of this method is that the number of parent parts finished in the operation is known.  

Material in the production BOM is linked to the routing records using routing link codes. The back flush takes place when an operation with a particular routing link code is posted with a finished quantity.  

The amount is the quantity per assembly on the production BOM multiplied by the number of parent items posted as output for the operation. This quantity might be different than the expected quantity.  

### Back flushing an entire order  

This reporting method doesn't consider routing link codes.  

No components are picked until the released production order status is changed to *Finished*. The amount is the quantity per assembly on the production BOM multiplied by the number of parent items that you finished and put in inventory.  

Backward flushing the entire production order requires the same setup as for forward flushing: The reporting method must be set to backward on each item card for all items within the parent BOM to be reported. In addition, all routing link codes must be removed from the production BOM. 

For example, if a production order to produce 800 meters requires 8 kg of a component, then when you post 200 meters as output, 2 kg are automatically posted as consumption.

You can achieve that by combining backward flushing method and routing link codes so that the quantity that is flushed for each operation is proportional to the actual output of the finished operation. For items that are set up with backward flushing method, the default behavior is to calculate and post component consumption when you change the status of a released production order to **Finished**. If you also define routing link codes, then calculation and posting occurs when each operation is finished, and the quantity that was consumed in the operation is posted. For more information, see [Create Routings](production-how-to-create-routings.md).  

## To flush components according to operation output

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Edit** action.  
3. On the **Replenishment** FastTab, in the **Flushing Method** field, select **Backward**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Select **Pick + Backward** if the component is used in a location that is set up for directed put-away and pick.  

4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Define routing link codes for every operation that consumes the component. For more information, see [Create Routings](production-how-to-create-routings.md).  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > Don't use the same routing link for different operations in the routing. Using the same routing link would lead to registration of consumption of component for each linked operation.  
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Production BOM**, and then choose the related link.  
7. Define routing link codes from each instance of the component to the operation that consumes it.

The consumption is posted automatically when you register output. To learn more, go to [Batch Post Output and Run Times](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md).

## Flushing methods

The following table describes the flushing method options that you can specify on **Item** cards and **Stockkeeping Unit** cards.

|Option|Description|
|------------|-------------|  
|Manual|You can manually consume items without picking. For each item, stockkeeping unit, or production order component line you can ignore the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** setting in the **Location Card** page. Skipping warehouse or inventory picks is typical for automatic flushing methods, such as **Backward** and **Forward**. It might be useful for components which, due to their nature, you store in the shop floor zone so there's no need to pick. However, they might require manual posting of consumption, for example, because the consumed quantity can very or they require item tracking.<br><br>To start using this feature, on the **Feature Management** page, activate **Feature Update: 'Manual' flushing method without requiring pick**. Existing records upgrade from **Manual** to the **Pick + Manual** flushing method. The **Pick + Manual** option is added immediately and works, regardless of whether you enable the feature key. If the feature isn't enabled, **Manual** and **Pick + Manual** both require picking due to the original behavior. When the feature key is enabled, the **Manual** option doesn't require picking.|
|Forward|Automatically posts consumption according to the production order component lines. <br><br>By default, the posting of component consumption occurs when you change the status of a production order to **Released**. However, if you use the **Routing Link** Code field on production order component lines, then posting occurs per operation when the operation starts. For more information, see [How to: Create Routing Links](production-how-to-create-routings.md#to-create-routing-links). <br><br> **Note**<br>For the forward flushing option, the operation-specific posting that you get with routing link codes is based on the expected quantity that is defined on the component line. For information about operation-specific flushing based on actual output, see the description of **Backward** in this article.<br><br>If the location or resources where this component is consumed are set up with a default bin structure, then the item is consumed from the **Open Shop Floor Bin Code**. For more information, see [How to: Set Up Basic Warehouses with Operations Areas](warehouse-how-to-set-up-basic-warehouses-with-operations-areas.md). <br><br> **Important** <br>Forward flushing also occurs when you choose **Refresh** on a released production order that was created from scratch. On the released production orders, you can't change bin information because you generate the production order component lines when you refresh the order. Refreshing the order forward flushes the components. Therefore, if you want to change bin information on production order component lines before forward flushing occurs, then that order must be created with the *Planned* or *Firm Planned* status.|
|Backward|Automatically calculates and posts consumption according to the production order component lines.<br><br> By default, the calculation and posting of component consumption occurs when you change the status of a released production order to **Finished**. However, if you use the **Routing Link Code** field on the production order component lines, then calculation and posting occurs when each operation is finished.<br><br> **Note** <br>Backward flushing and routing link codes can be combined so that the quantity that is flushed per operation is proportional to the actual output of that operation. For more information, see [How to: Flush Components According to Operation Output](#to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output).<br><br> If the location or machine center where this component is consumed are set up with a default bin structure, then the item is consumed from the **Open Shop Floor Bin Code**.|
|Pick + Forward|Same as for Forward flushing method, except it only works for locations that use either advanced warehouse configuration or basic warehouse configuration with mandatory bins.<br><br> Consumption is calculated and posted from the bin that is defined in the **To-Production Bin Code** field on the location or machine center after the component is picked in the warehouse.<br><br> **Note** <br>If a component uses the Pick + Forward flushing method, it can't have a routing link code to an operation that uses the forward flushing method. The component would then be automatically flushed when the operation starts, which makes it impossible to request the pick activity.|
|Pick + Backward|Same as for Backward flushing method, except it only works for locations use either advanced warehouse configuration or basic warehouse configuration with mandatory bins.<br><br> Consumption is calculated and posted from the bin that is defined in the **To-Production Bin Code** field on the location or machine center after the component is picked in the warehouse.|
|Pick + Manual|Require picking if consumption needs to happen at a location where warehouse handling is enabled.|

# Set up general inventory information

You specify your general inventory setup on the **Inventory Setup** page.

## To set up general inventory information

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Inventory Setup** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### To set up inventory valuation and costing

To record inventory costs correctly, you must set up various fields and pages before you make transactions that include item. Typically, businesses choose a specific costing method and apply that to inventory items, for example, to help them track the value of items on stock.  

|**Field**|**Details**|  
|------------|-------------|
|**Automatic Cost Posting**|Ensure that the cost is automatically posted to the general ledger whenever an inventory transaction is posted. The field is turned on by default to ensure that inventory values are always correct in the general ledger. Alternatively, you can manually post costs at regular intervals with the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job. You can also turn off automatic cost posting. A notification displays from which you can start an assisted setup guide to help you schedule tasks for the job queue. To learn more, go to [Reconcile Inventory Costs with the General Ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md).|
|**Automatic Cost Adjustment**| Specifies if item value entries are automatically adjusted when an item transaction is posted. The field is set to **Always** by default to ensure that inventory values are always correct, which in turn keeps your sales and profit statistics up to date. Cost adjustment forwards cost changes from inbound entries, such as purchases or production output, to the related outbound entries, such as sales or transfers. The adjustment is helpful for new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers and small businesses with relatively low inventory transaction levels. However, as a business grows and inventory levels increase, adjustments can slow down system performance. To minimize reduced performance during posting, select a time option to define how far back in time from the work date an inbound transaction can occur to potentially trigger adjustment of related outbound value entries. Alternatively, you can manually adjust costs at regular intervals with the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. You can also set the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field to **Never**. A notification displays from which you can start an assisted setup guide to help you schedule tasks for the job queue. To learn more, go to [Adjust Item Costs](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md).|
|**Expected Cost Posting to G/L**|Ensure that you post expected costs to the general ledger. The interim G/L accounts show an estimate of the amounts due and the cost of the traded items before you invoice them. To learn more, go to [Design Details: Expected Cost Posting](design-details-expected-cost-posting.md) and [Reconcile Inventory Costs with the General Ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md).|
|**Average Cost Calc. Type**|Define if the average cost is to be calculated per item only or per item for each stockkeeping unit and for each variant of the item. To learn more, go to [Design details: average cost](design-details-average-cost.md).|
|**Average Cost Period**|Select the period of time you would like application to use for calculating the weighted average cost of items that use the average costing method. To learn more, go to [Design details: average cost](design-details-average-cost.md).|
|**Default Costing Method**|Select the default costing method that determines whether an actual or a budgeted value is capitalized and used in the cost calculation. You can select a different costing method for a specific item either by selecting item template where costing method is defined or by manually selecting a different value on the **Item Card** page. To learn more, go to [Design details: costing methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).|

To learn more about costing in general, go to [Managing Inventory Costs](finance-manage-inventory-costs.md).  

If you want to include warehouse handling times in the order promising calculation on purchase lines, you can set it up as a default for inventory on the **Inventory Setup** page, and for your location. To learn more, go to [Calculate Order Promising Dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md).  

## Allow workers to post transactions at the same time

To allow people to post inventory transactions at the same time, you can enable the **Enable multiple users to post item ledger entries and value entries at the same time** feature on the **Feature Management** page. By default, the feature isn’t enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Similar features are available for project, resource, and warehouse entries. To learn more, go to:
>
> * [Allow multiple people to post project transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-jobs.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-project-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Allow multiple people to post resource transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-resources.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-resource-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Design details: Creating warehouse entries](design-details-warehouse-entries.md)

If you enable the feature, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns entry numbers for each table from `SequenceNumbers` in the database, which allows more people to post transactions at the same time. The result can be that sometimes inventory entries from two or more transactions are interleaved. For example, an item register might contain any or all of the entry tables, as shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="media/interleaved inventory tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the item register with several entry tables." lightbox="media/interleaved inventory tables.png":::

If you don’t enable the feature, when someone posts an inventory transaction the tables are locked and other users can’t post inventory transactions. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in each table and assigns a number that’s one higher. This numbering ensures that entries that belong to the same register are consecutive, but prevents other people from posting at the same time.

> [!NOTE]
> You might not want to enable the feature if you have a feature or extension that:
>
> - Relies on consecutive entry numbers.
> - Requires that tables are locked throughout the posting process.

# View the availability of items

From the context of a business task, you can get advanced information about when and where an item is available, such as when talking to a customer about a delivery date.

You can view the availability of all items per location, and you can view the availability of each item by event or by period as well. An event is any scheduled item transaction, such as a sales shipment or an inbound transfer receipt.

> [!NOTE]  
>   Availability views by location require that you maintain inventory at more than one location. For more information, see [Set Up Locations](inventory-how-setup-locations.md).

If you use warehousing functionality, availability varies depending on allocations at the bin level when warehouse activities such as picks and movements occur and when the inventory reservation system imposes restrictions to comply with. A rather complex algorithm verifies that all conditions are met before allocating quantities to picks for outbound flows. For more information, see [Design Details: Availability in the Warehouse](design-details-availability-in-the-warehouse.md).

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], availability figures are typically shown in two different fields, each with a different definition:

* The **Quantity on Hand** field, in some places named **Inventory**, shows the actual quantity today according to posted item ledger entries.
* The **Projected Available Balance** field is calculated and shows the quantity on hand plus scheduled receipts minus gross requirements. (In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], scheduled receipts include quantities on purchase orders and inbound transfer orders. Gross requirements include quantities on sales orders and outbound transfer orders.)

> [!TIP]  
>   The projected available balance is especially relevant to view in the **Item Availability by Periods** and **Item Availability by Event** pages because they contain the date dimension.  

> [!NOTE]  
>   The following procedures describe how to view advanced availability information from the items list and item card. You can also access the information from sales document lines for the item on the line. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

## To view the availability of an item according to when it will be received or shipped

You view the availability of an item according to scheduled item transactions on the **Availability by Event** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of an item that you want to view availability for.
3. Choose the **Item Availability by** action, and then choose the **Event** action.

    The **Item Availability by Event** page shows how the inventory quantity of the item will develop over time according to scheduled shipment and receipt events. The page gives a condensed view that shows one line of accumulated information per time interval in which inventory quantities change. Time intervals where no events occurred aren't shown. You can expand each line to show details about the event or events that caused the accumulated quantity on the line.
4. Choose the value in the **Projected Available Balance** field to view the item ledger entries or open documents that make up the value.

## To view the availability of an item in different periods

You view the availability of an item over time for specified time periods on the **Item Availability by Periods** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of an item that you want to view availability for.
3. Choose the **Item Availability by** action, and then choose the **Period** action.

    The **Item Availability by Periods** page shows how the inventory quantity of the item will develop over time, shown for a period that you select, such as Day, Week, or Quarter.
4. Choose the value in the **Projected Available Balance** field to view the item ledger entries or open documents that make up the value.

## To view the availability of an item at the locations where it's stored

You view the availability of an item at the different places where it's stored on the **Item Availability by Location** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of an item that you want to view availability for.
3. Choose the **Item Availability by** action, and then choose the **Location** action.

    The **Item Availability by Location** page shows how the inventory quantity of the item will develop in the future, shown for each location where it's stored.
4. Choose the value in the **Qty. on Hand** field to view the item ledger entries that make up the value.
5. Choose the value in the **Projected Available Balance** field to view the item ledger entries or open documents that make up the value.

## To view the availability of all items by the location where they're stored

You view the availability of all your items across all your locations on the **Items by Location** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Items by Location** action.

    The **Items by Location** page shows for all your items how many are available at each location.
3. Choose the value in the **Qty. on Hand** field to view the item ledger entries that make up the value.

## To view the availability of an item by its use in assembly or production BOMs

If an item is part of assembly or production BOMs as either a parent item or a component, you can view how many units of it are required on the **Item Availability by BOM Level** page. The page shows how many units of a parent item you can make based on the availability of child items on underlying lines. Any item that has an assembly or production BOM is shown on the page as a collapsible line. You can expand this line to see the underlying components and lower-level subassemblies with their own BOMs.

For example, you can use the page to determine whether you can fulfill a sales order for an item on a specified date by looking at its current availability and the quantities that can be supplied by its components. You can also use the page to identify bottlenecks in related BOMs.

On each line on the page for both parent items and child items, the following key fields specify the availability figures. You can use these figures to promise how many units of a parent you can supply if you start the related assembly process.

|Field|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Able to Make Parent**|Shows how many units of any subassembly in the top item you can make. The field specifies how many immediate parent units you can assemble. The value is based on availability of the item on the line.|
|**Able to Make Top Item**|Shows how many units of the top item you can make. The field specifies how many units of the top-line BOM item you can assemble. The value is based on availability of the item on the line.|

### To view the availability of an item according to demand for its parent

The **Item Availability by BOM Level** page shows information for the item on the card or document line that the page is opened for. The item is always shown on the top line. You can view information for other items or for all items by changing the value in the **Item Filter** field.

> [!NOTE]  
>   By default, availability figures on the lines show the total availability of all items under the top item. These figures are displayed in the **Available Quantity** field, and the focus is on the top item. However, information about how many subassemblies you can make may be skewed. To get a true indication of how many of the shown subassemblies you can make, you must clear the **Show Total Availability** check box and then see the figure in the **Able to Make Parent** field.

The **Bottleneck** field specifies which item in the BOM structure restricts you from making a larger quantity than the quantity that is shown in the **Able to Make Top Item** field. For example, the bottleneck item can be a purchased component with an expected receipt date that is too late to make additional units of the top item by the date in the **Needed by Date** field.

## To view the availability of an item by its units of measure

The **Item Availability by Unit of Measure** page shows the availability of an item in the units of measure that it's stored in.

> [!NOTE]  
> To keep this information accurate, you must convert item units of measure. For example, if you purchase an item in one unit of measure, such as boxes, and you sell items in another unit of measure, such as pieces, you must use an item journal to convert the units of measure, or "unbox" items. You can use a negative adjustment item journal line to reduce inventory in the purchase unit of measure, for example boxes, and a positive adjustment to increase inventory in the sales unit of measure, for example pieces. 

## To view the availability of an item by its variants

The **Item Availability by Variant** page shows the actual and projected availability of an item grouped according to variant code.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of an item that you want to view availability for.
3. Choose the **Item Availability by** action, and then choose the **Variant** action.

    The **Item Availability by Variant** page shows availability for every variant that exists for the item. The page is empty if no variants exist for the item.

4. In the **View by** field, select the length of the time period that you want to view.
5. View the availability figures in the different quantity fields for each line.

[!INCLUDE [inventory_variant-availability](includes/inventory_variant-availability.md)]

## Assembly availability page

The **Assembly Availability** page shows detailed availability information for the assembly item. It opens:

- Automatically from a sales order line in assemble-to-order scenarios when you enter a quantity that causes a component availability issue.
- Automatically from an assembly order header when you enter a value in the Quantity field that causes a component availability issue.
- Manually when you open it from an assembly order. On the Actions tab, in the Functions group, select Show Availability.

The **Details** FastTab shows detailed availability information for the assembly item, including how many of the assembly order quantity can be assembled by the due date based on availability of the required components. This is shown in the Able to Assemble field on the Details FastTab.

The value in the **Able to Assemble** field is shown in red font if the quantity is lower than the quantity in the **Remaining Quantity** field, indicating that there aren't enough components available to assemble the full quantity.

The **Lines** FastTab shows detailed availability information for the assembly components.

If one or more assembly components aren't available, then this is reflected in the **Able to Assemble** field on the line in question as a quantity less than the quantity in the **Remaining Quantity** field on the **Details** FastTab.

# Close open item ledger entries resulting from fixed application in the item journal

You can use the **Applies-from Entry** field on the **Item Journal** page to create a fixed application between an inbound transaction and the original outbound transaction. For example, to correct the outbound transaction or to process its return.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Fixed applications made in this manner only apply the cost, not the quantity. Accordingly, the posted positive item ledger entry will not close the applied outbound entry and will itself remain open. This also applies when you post a fixed application for a positive entry to a negative entry that has not been closed by a regular positive entry, then both the negative and the positive entries will remain open.  
>
> This also means that you cannot close an inventory period if such an entry exists.  

You can change and reapply application entries under certain conditions by using the **Application Worksheet** page.  

The following procedure shows how to close such entries by performing two corrective postings in the item journal.  

## To close open item ledger entries that result from a fixed application in the item journal  

1. Use the **Applies-from Entry** field to post a positive adjustment with the corresponding quantity. This closes the original negative entry with a fixed application.  

    The **Applies-from Entry** field specifies the number of the outbound item ledger entry whose cost is forwarded to the inbound item ledger entry when you post an inbound transaction of type **Positive Adjmt.** or **Purchase** with the item journal.  
2. Use the **Applies-to Entry** field to post a negative adjustment. This closes the original corrective positive entry with a fixed application.  

    The **Applies-to Entry** field specifies if the quantity in the item journal line should be applied to an already-posted document. If so, enter the entry number of the item ledger entry to which the item journal line should be applied.

# Finding pages and information with Tell Me

This article describes how the in-product search, *Tell me what you want to do*, can help you: 

* Quickly go to things like actions, pages, or reports.
* Search for specific data, either on a list page or in all of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Find [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] documentation about a subject you're interested in.

<!-- ![!VIDEO https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2086048] -->

When you need help with finding something, use the ![Tell me what you want to do.](media/ui-search/search.png "Search for Page or Report") **Search** icon to search for it. You can also use <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> to start a search.

When you start typing characters on the **Tell me what you want to do** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] immediately displays matches. Results in the list change as you type more characters. If you notice that when you enter the word *product* and the results include *items*, that's because search uses synonyms and alternate search terms to make it easier to find actions, pages, and reports.

The column to the right indicates the general category of the result. For example, whether it opens a list page or is an administrative task.  

At the bottom of the **Tell me what you want to do** page, the **exploring pages and reports** action opens a feature overview that shows you all available features for your role or for all roles. Learn more at [Finding Pages with the Role Explorer](ui-role-explorer.md).

> [!TIP]  
> If you prefer to use your keyboard, use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key and <kbd>Arrow</kbd> keys to choose an item in the results. If you select the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key on your keyboard without choosing a result, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] opens the result that is listed first.

The **Tell me what you want to do** page categorizes results based on the data that you enter and the page you're working on. The following sections describe the categories.

## Find an action on the current page

The **On current page** section lets you find actions on the page you have open. For example, if the **Sales Quote** page is open and you type "customer," the section includes an action that opens the Customer Card page for the customer chosen on the sales quote.

> [!NOTE]  
> The list includes only actions that are available on the navigation bar at the top of the page. Actions on FastTabs aren't included.  

## Find a page or a task

The results in the **Go to Pages and Tasks** section provide access to other pages and let you perform tasks or look up information. If you use these pages often, you can choose the bookmark icon to add a link to any page onto your Role Center. Learn more in [Add a Page Action to Your Role Center](ui-bookmarks.md).

The pages and tasks that are listed depend on the user experience you chose for your company. The **Essentials** experience gives access to fewer pages and tasks than the **Premium** experience does. The first time you sign in, you use the **Essentials** experience. Learn more about user experiences in [Customizing Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Experience](ui-experiences.md).

## Find a report or archived information

The **Go to Reports and Analysis** section offers access to reporting tools. For example, you can open the **Balance Sheet** report from the list, or access archived documents and other information.  

## Find a record or search the documentation

The **Search for \<keyword\>** section [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a couple of ways to search:

* Use the **Search company data** action to search all pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more about how the company data search works in [Search for a record in company data](ui-search-data.md).
* Use the **Search Help** action to find an article in the Business Central documentation that contains your keyword.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > Your search results won't include documentation for third-party extensions.

### Use Tell me what you want to do

Use the ![Tell me what you want to do.](media/ui-search/search.png "Search for Page or Report") **Search** icon to search for data across [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, you can find a customer by entering their name or address, or even find a specific record, such as a sales order. You can also use it to find information in our documentation.

Just enter at least three characters of a keyword, and then choose either **Search company data** or **Search Help**.

* If you search for data, results display on the **Search in company data** page, where they're sorted by type.  
* If you search in our Help, the **Help** pane offers links to articles that contain your keywords. You'll also get a snippet from the article that can help you decide whether it's what you're interested in.

> [!NOTE]
> For data, searching everything in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might take time. To speed up results, use the **Show tables to search** action to choose the tables and fields that you want to include in your searches. The tables and fields that you can choose from vary, depending on your Role Center. By default, all tables and fields are chosen, which can slow down the search. We recommend that you exclude as many tables and fields as you can.

[!INCLUDE [ui-how-search-works](includes/ui-how-search-works.md)]

## Get more functionality from apps

Our partner community is busily developing apps that add capabilities to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The **Get from Microsoft AppSource** section lists apps for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that are available on Microsoft AppSource and are related to the keyword you searched for.

## Use search on list pages

It isn't related to Tell me what you want to do, but there's another way to search for specific data. When you're using a list page, you can use the ![Search list](media/ui-search/search-list.png "Search list icon") **Search** field in the left corner of list page headers to search for data on the page. The search applies only to the list you're viewing. Learn more about working with data on list pages in [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering Lists](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#searching).  

> [!TIP]
> You can search for posted document lines, such as invoice lines, credit memo lines, shipment lines, and receipt lines. Search for the type of document lines that you want to find, and then bookmark the links to the documents on your home page for easy access to the original or a filtered view. Learn more in [Add a Page Action to Your Role Center](ui-bookmarks.md).

## Questions?

We've shown search to a range of stakeholders, noted the questions that they had in common, and turned our notes into a list of frequently asked questions. If you're interested, go to [Tell Me FAQ](ui-search-faq.md).

# Create service invoices or credit memos

Ease in invoicing your service orders is a key feature of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can set up your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so that a service technician in the field can create an invoice for a service that isn't connected to a contract or order. Alternatively, set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so that you invoice service contracts periodically. The invoice period for each contract defines how often you invoice it.

## To invoice several service contracts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Service Contract Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Set the filters you want to apply.  
3. In the **Posting Date** field, enter the date to use as the posting date on the service invoices.  
4. In the **Invoice to Date** field, enter the date up to which you want to invoice contracts. The batch job will include the contracts with the next invoice dates, up to this date.  
5. In the **Action** field, choose **Create Invoices**.  
6. Choose **OK** to create the service invoices.  
  
You can also invoice a service contract directly from the **Service Contract** page, if the next invoice date on the contract is earlier than the working date.

## To invoice a service contract from the Service Contract page   

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service contract to invoice, and open the contract card.  
3. Choose **Create Service Invoice** action. 
4. Choose **Yes** to create the service invoices.  
  
  > [!NOTE]  
  > You can't create service invoices for the service contract when the **Change Status** field value is set to **Open**.  

## To post an invoice from a service order  

The following procedure describes how to define the part of service that you'll charge the customer for.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order to invoice, and open the order card.  
3. Choose the **Service Lines** action.  
4. Find the required entries, and then specify the quantities for which you will charge the customer in the **Qty. to Invoice** field.  
  
   > [!NOTE]  
   > You can invoice the customer for the registered service either fully or in parts. If you choose to invoice the customer fully, the value in the **Qty. to Invoice** field must equal the value in the **Quantity** field. You can post a full invoice together with a full shipment, and you can post a full invoice for an already posted full shipment that isn't invoiced or consumed.  
   >  
   > When you post a partial invoice, there are two ways of specifying the quantity to invoice. If you're going to post the service with **the Ship and Invoice** option, the value in the **Qty. to Invoice** field must equal the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field. If you want to invoice an already posted shipment, the quantity to invoice must not be larger than the value in the **Quantity Shipped** field.  
  
5. Choose **Post**, and then either **Invoice** or **Ship and Invoice**. To learn more, go to [Posting in Service Management](service-service-posting.md).  
  
 The service line you selected is posted. You can post several service lines at the same time by selecting them and choosing **Post**. If you do, make sure you fill in all the necessary information on the lines.  
  
 When you post the order with the **Invoice** option, a posted service invoice is created along with the corresponding ledger entries and updates to the relevant fields on the service lines of the order. Also, previously posted shipment documents are updated with the invoiced quantities. If you select the **Ship and Invoice** posting option, a posted shipment is created.

## To create a service invoice manually  

Typically, after you post a service order with the **Invoice** or **Ship and Invoice** option, a service invoice is posted automatically. Yet, you may need to issue an invoice that isn't linked to a service contract or order. This procedure explains how to issue an invoice at the same time that the customer receives the service.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service invoice.  
3. Fill in the **No.** field.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you have set up number series for service invoices on the **Service Mgt. Setup** page, you can select **Enter** to select the next available service invoice number.  
  
4. In the **Customer No.** field, enter the number of a customer. Select the relevant customer from the list.  
  
    The customer fields are filled in with information from the **Customer** card.  
  
5. Enter a date in the **Posting Date** field. This date will appear on the posted entries. This field shows your current work date, but you can change the date.  
6. In the **Document Date** field, enter a date that will appear on the printed invoice and be used to calculate the due date.  
7. Fill in the service lines of the invoice. Fill in the **Type**, **No.**, and **Quantity** fields to register items, resources and costs that have been used in servicing.

## To create an invoice that combines posted shipment lines from one or more service orders 

You might need to create a service invoice for a service that's already shipped, either from one or several service orders, but not yet invoiced or consumed. You can fill in the invoice lines automatically with the selected posted shipment lines for a specific customer.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] 
3. Create invoice lines for services shipped but not invoiced. Alternatively, you can use the **Get Shipment Lines** action to add posted shipment lines to the invoice.  
4. Post the service invoice.  
  
 The posted service invoice and the corresponding ledger entries are created. Previously posted shipment documents update with the invoiced quantities and the quantities on the service lines of the source orders.  

## To create a service credit memo  

You typically use a service credit memo document when a customer returns an item. However, you can also use them to reimburse a customer or to correct a invoice that was a mistake.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. The **Posting Date** and **Document Date** fields display the work date. If needed, you can change it.    
4. On the credit memo lines, enter information about the items that have been returned or removed, or the compensation that will be given to the customer.  

## Correct errors in service invoices

You can delete service invoices that have service ledger entries associated with them. This means that you can correct errors or make changes to service invoices without getting stuck or losing data. For example, if you forget to assign a product posting group to a G/L account, you can add it later and recreate the service invoice.

Use the :::image type="content" source="media/copilot-delete-trash-can.png" alt-text="Delete action icon"::: action to delete a service invoice. 

When you delete a service invoice, the following things happen:

* Post a corrective service ledger entry
* Restore the invoicing date and period in the contract, which lets you create the invoice again.

> [!NOTE]
> You can revert several invoices, but you must do so sequentially, starting from the last invoice.
>
> You can't delete a service invoice if its details, such as the invoicing period or the **Prepaid** toggle were changed in the related service contract. Make sure that you delete invoices before you change settings on the service contract.

# Create incoming document records directly from documents and entries

You can store external business documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by attaching the document files to the related incoming document records. If the document, such as a purchase invoice, didn't start its existence as an incoming document record, you can still create and connect an incoming document record to it later. You can also attach incoming document files to posted purchase and sales documents and to vendor, customer, and general ledger entries by using the **Incoming Document Files** FactBox in, for example, the **Posted Purchase Invoices** and **Vendor Ledger Entries** pages.

From the **Chart of Accounts** and **General Ledger Entries** pages, you can use a search function to find general ledger entries for posted purchase and sales documents that don't have incoming document records and then centrally link to existing records or create new ones with attached document files. For more information, see [Find Posted Documents without Incoming Document Records](across-how-find-posted-documents-without-income-document-records.md).

The following procedures show how to attach a file to a vendor ledger entry or an existing purchase invoice that wasn't created from an incoming document record. Attaching a file to posted purchase or sales documents works in a similar way.

[!INCLUDE [incoming-doc-archived-doc](includes/incoming-doc-archived-doc.md)]

## Create and connect an incoming document record from a purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line for a purchase invoice that you want to attach a file to, and then choose the **Create Incoming Document from File** action.
3. Alternatively, select the line for a purchase invoice that you want to attach a file to, and then choose the **Attach File** action.
4. On the **Insert File** page, do one of the following steps to attach a file that represents the incoming document in question:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]


## Create and connect an incoming document record from a vendor ledger entry

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendor Ledger Entries**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a line for a vendor ledger entry that you want to attach a file to, and then choose the **Create Incoming Document from File** action.
3. Alternatively, select a line for a vendor ledger entry that you want to attach a file to, and then choose the **Attach File** action.
4. On the **Insert File** page, do one of the following steps to attach a file that represents the incoming document in question:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]


## Remove a connection from an incoming document record to a posted document

You can remove file attachments from non-posted documents at any time by deleting the related incoming document record. If the document is posted, then you must first remove the connection from the incoming document record.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Documents**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line for an incoming document record connected to a posted document that you want to remove, and then choose the **Remove Reference to Record** action.

The connection to the posted document is removed. You can now proceed to connect another incoming document record to the posted document as described in this article.

# Use non-deductible VAT

This article explains how to use and report non-deductible VAT.

## Create a purchase invoice with non-deductible VAT

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then select the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a purchase invoice, and enter the appropriate information on the invoice header.
3. In the **Lines** section, create a new line of any type, based on the VAT business posting group and the VAT product posting group where you configure non-deductible VAT.
4. In the **Quantity** and **Direct Unit Cost** fields, enter appropriate values.

    If you selected the **Show Non-Ded. VAT In Lines** checkbox on the **VAT Setup** page, the amounts in the **Non-Deductible VAT Base** and **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** fields are calculated based on the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field on the **VAT Posting Setup** page.

5. Post the invoice.

## Create a purchase order with non-deductible VAT

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders** and then select the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a purchase order, and enter the appropriate information on the document header.
3. In the **Lines** section, create a new line of any type, based on the VAT business posting group and the VAT product posting group where you configure non-deductible VAT.
4. In the **Quantity** and **Direct Unit Cost** fields, enter appropriate values.

    If you selected the **Show Non-Ded. VAT In Lines** checkbox on the **VAT Setup** page, the amounts in the **Non-Deductible VAT Base** and **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** fields are calculated based on the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field on the **VAT Posting Setup** page.

5. Post the purchase order.

## Adjust rounded VAT amounts before document posting

If VAT amounts aren't rounded in the same way in your environment and in the external accounting system (the original invoice document), you can adjust the VAT amount before you post the document. To make this adjustment, follow these steps before you post the document.

1. On the Action Pane, select **Statistic**.
2. If you're working with a purchase invoice, follow these steps:

    1. On the **Lines** FastTab, select the VAT amount or non-deductible VAT amount.
    2. Set the values that you need from the original document, and then close the **Purchase Invoice Statistics** page.

3.	If you're working with the purchase order, follow these steps:

    1. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, select **No. of Tax Lines** to open the **VAT Amounts Lines** page.
    2. Select the VAT amount or non-deductible VAT amount that you want to correct.
    3. Enter the values that you need from the original document, close the **VAT Amount lines** page, and then close the **Purchase Order Statistics** page.

To use adjustments of VAT amounts, you must enable the adjustments. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, in the **Max. VAT Difference Allowed** field, enter the maximum allowed VAT amount for correction. Then, on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page, select **Allow VAT Difference**.

You can adjust the values of the **VAT Amount** and **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** fields. The value of the **Deductible VAT Amount** field is the result of these two values. The amount that you enter in the **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** field can't be more than the amount that you enter in the **VAT Amount** field. The **Max. VAT Difference Allowed** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page works independently for deductible and non-deductible VAT amounts on statistic pages when you want to adjust VAT amounts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't use non-deductible VAT on the prepayment invoices.

# Manage human resources

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can keep detailed records of your employees. You can register and maintain employee information, such as employment contracts, confidential information, qualifications, and employee contacts.

You can also register employee absences, which allows you to analyze registered absences as necessary.

To start using the Human Resources functionality, you must set up employees and other basic information. You can then associate various codes to an employee, which allows you to filter information for specific employees.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Select a check layout

You can design your checks to conform with the standards set by the local authorities. Check images can be printed in English, French, or Spanish.

Checks are designed to print in both the United States and Canadian check image formats in either a check-stub-check format or a stub-stub-check format.

## To select a check layout

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Selections Bank Account**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Report Selection - Bank Acc.** page, in the **Usage** field, select **Check**.
3. Select one of the following report IDs.

| Report ID | Report Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1401 |Check |This report is the default report. |
| 10411 |Check (Stub/Stub/Check) |This report is designed to print checks in a stub/stub/check format. |
| 10412 |Check (Stub/Check/Stub) |This report is designed to print checks in a stub/check/stub format. |
| 10413 |Three Checks per Page |This report is designed to print three checks on each page. |

After you set up check layouts, you can print checks from the **Payment Journal** page. Learn more in [Work with Checks](payables-how-work-checks.md).

To change one of these default check layouts, use either the Word or the RDLC integration to do so. Learn more in [Create and Modify Custom Report Layouts](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).

## Use MICR and security fonts

The online version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contains preinstalled fonts on the servers that can be used when defining check layouts. The following outlines which fonts are available and have links to detailed information by the 3rd-party suppliers of the fonts.

> [!Important]
> MICR and check security fonts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are licensed in a font package from IDAutomation.com, Inc. These products may only be used as part of and in connection with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

In update 15.3 and later, Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) fonts are installed and available to use. Both the E-13B and the CMC-7 standards are supported. Special security fonts are also available to generate text, names, amounts, and the currency symbols such as Dollar, Euro, Pound, and Yen, which are hard to tamper with once a check is printed.

> [!NOTE]
> - For security and legal reasons, you cannot upload custom fonts to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online environment.
> - With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the MICR and check security fonts from IDAutomation.com aren't available by default. You must purchase them from IDAutomation.com or another supplier. Once you have the fonts, install them on the computer that runs the [!INCLUDE[server](includes/server.md)]. As a minimum, install the fonts for the user that runs the [!INCLUDE[server](includes/server.md)] instance, that is, the service account. To install the fonts, follow the instructions from the font supplier or refer to [Add a Font](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-a-font-b7c5f17c-4426-4b53-967f-455339c564c1).

### MICR E-13B specifications

The following illustration summarizes specifications for the MICR E-13B fonts that can be useful when calibrating fonts to be on check layouts with specific MICR printers.

![MICR E-13B Specifications.](media/font_MICR_E-13B_Specifications.png "MICR E-13B Specifications")

### Delimiter characters

![Delimiter characters.](media/font-micr-letters.png "Delimiter characters")

The full specification of MICR E-13B fonts can be found in the supplier's documentation here: (https://www.idautomation.com/micr-fonts/e13b/).

### MICR CMC-7 specifications

The following CMC-7 fonts are available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online:

- IDAutomationCMC7
- IDAutomationCMC7n10
- IDAutomationCMC7n25
- IDAutomationCMC7n40

# Invoice sales

You can usually create either a sales order or sales invoice to record your agreement with a customer to sell certain products on certain delivery and payment terms.  

However, you must use a sales order instead of a sales invoice if you:  

* Need to ship only part of an order quantity, for example, because the full quantity isn't on hand.  
* Ship products after you post the corresponding sales invoices.
* Sell items your vendor delivers directly to your customer, known as drop shipment. Learn more at [Make Drop Shipments](sales-how-drop-shipment.md).  

In all other situations, sales orders and sales invoices work in the same way. Learn more about how to use sales orders at [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

You can negotiate with the customer by first creating a sales quote, which you can convert to a sales invoice when you agree on the sale. Learn more at [Make Sales Quotes](sales-how-make-offers.md).

## Create sales invoices

If the customer decides to buy, you post the sales invoice to create the related quantity and value entries. When you post the sales invoice, you can also email it as a PDF attachment. You can prefill the email body with a summary of the invoice and payment information, such as providing a link to PayPal. Learn more at [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md#to-send-documents-by-email). When the customer pays the invoice, you can register that payment in different ways, depending on the size and preferred workflows of your organization. Learn more at [Registering Payments](#register-payments) section.  

Item cards can be of the **Inventory**, **Service**, or **Non-Inventory** type to specify if the item is a physical inventory unit, a labor time unit, or a physical unit not kept on inventory, respectively. Learn more at [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md). The sales invoice process is the same for all three item types.

You can fill customer fields on the sales invoice in one of two ways, depending on whether the customer is already registered. See step 2 in the following procedure.

### To create a sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Customer Name** field, enter the name of an existing customer. If, however, the customer is new and therefore not registered, follow these steps to populate standard customer information on the **Sales Invoice** page:

    1. In the **Customer Name** field, enter the name of the new customer.
    2. In the dialog box about registering the new customer, choose **OK**.
    3. On the **Select a template for a new customer** page, choose a template to base the new customer card on, then choose **OK**.
    4. A new customer card displays the information on the selected customer template. Fill in the remaining fields. Learn more at [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).  
    5. When you complete the customer card, choose **Close** to return to the **Sales Invoice** page.

   Several fields on the sales invoice are now filled with information that you specified on the new customer card.  
3. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Invoice** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you allow the customer to pay immediately, for example, by cash or PayPal, then fill in the **Payment Method Code** field. The payment is then recorded as soon as you post the sales invoice. If you select *Cash*, then the payment is recorded in a specified balancing account.

    You're now ready to fill in the **Lines** FastTab with products you're selling to the customer or for any transaction with the customer you want to record in a general ledger (G/L) account.

4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select the type of product, charge, or transaction you post for the customer on the sales line.
   > [!TIP]
   > If you set up recurring sales lines for the customer, such as a monthly replenishment order, you can reflect that in the order by choosing the **Get Recurring Sales Lines** action.
5. In the **No.** field, select a record to post according to the value in the **Type** field.

    You leave the **No.** field blank in the following cases:

    * If the line is for a comment. Write the comment in the **Description** field.
    * If the line is for a catalog item. Choose the **Select Catalog Items** action. Learn more at [Work With Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).

6. In the **Quantity** field, enter how many units of the product, charge, or transaction the line should record for the customer.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the item is of the **Service** type, or the **Type** field contains **Resource**, then the quantity is a time unit, such as hours, as indicated in the **Unit of Measure Code** field on the line. Learn more at [Set Up Item Units of Measure](inventory-how-setup-units-of-measure.md)

    The value in the **Line Amount** field is calculated as *Unit Price* × *Quantity*.  

    The price and line amounts are with or without sales tax, depending on what you selected in the **Prices Including Tax** field on the customer card.  
7. If you want to give a discount, enter a percentage in the **Line Discount %** field. The value in the **Line Amount** field updates accordingly.  

    If special item prices are set up on the **Sales Prices and Sales Line Discounts** FastTab on the customer or item card, upon meeting the price criteria the price and amount on the sales line automatically update. Learn more at [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).  
8. Repeat steps 4 through 7 for every product or charge that you want to invoice the customer for.

    The totals fields under the lines are automatically updated, as you create or modify lines, to display the amounts posted to the ledgers.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In rare cases, the posted amounts might differ from what displays in the totals fields. The difference is typically due to rounding calculations for VAT or sales tax.<br /><br />To verify the amounts before you post, use the **Customer Statistics** FactBox. Also, when you choose the **Release** action, the values in the totals fields update to include rounding calculations.

9. In the **Inv. Discount Amount Excl. Tax** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field.

    If you set up invoice discounts for the customer, then the specified percentage value is automatically inserted in the **Invoice Discount %** field if the discount criteria are met, and the related amount is inserted in the **Inv. Discount Amount Excl. Tax** field. Learn more at [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

10. When the sales invoice lines are completed, choose the **Post and Send** action.  

The **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box displays the customer's preferred method of receiving documents. You can change the sending method by choosing the lookup button for the **Send Document to** field. Learn more at [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).

The related item and customer ledger entries are now created in your system, and the sales invoice is output as a PDF document. The sales invoice is removed from the list of sales invoices and replaced with a new document in the list of posted sales invoices.  

### Calculate invoice discounts on sales

[!INCLUDE [sales-invoice-discounts](includes/sales-invoice-discounts.md)]

## Posted invoices

[!INCLUDE [posted-invoices](includes/posted-invoices.md)]

You can easily correct or cancel a posted sales invoice before the final payment. For example, you might want to correct a typing mistake, or the customer requests a change. Learn more at [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Sales Invoices](sales-how-correct-cancel-sales-invoice.md). If the posted sales invoice is paid, you must create a sales credit memo to reverse the sale. Learn more at [Process Sales Returns or Cancellations](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md).  

[Open the **Posted Sales Invoices** list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=143) in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Register payments

Depending on your business needs, you can get paid and register a payment in different ways: manually, automatically, and through payment services.  

You can process the payments straight from the customer card. Use the **Register Customer Payments** action to get an overview of unpaid invoices for that customer. Then, mark the invoice as paid partially or in full. This payment reconciliation processes your customer payments by matching amounts received in your bank account with the related unpaid sales invoices, and then posts the payments. Learn more in the [To reconcile payments individually](receivables-how-reconcile-customer-payments-list-unpaid-sales-documents.md#to-register-customer-payments-individually) section.  

In business environments where the customer pays after delivery. According to the payment terms, a posted sales invoice remains open (unpaid) until someone verifies the payment and applies it to the posted sales invoice. You can apply payments manually or automatically. Learn more at [Reconcile Customer Payments with the Cash Receipt Journal or from Customer Ledger Entries](receivables-how-apply-sales-transactions-manually.md) and [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).  

In business environments where customers pay immediately, such as via PayPal or cash, payment is recorded immediately when you post the sales invoice. Also, the posted sales invoice is closed as fully applied. You select the relevant method in the **Payment Method Code** field on the sales order. For electronic payments, such as PayPal, you must also fill in the **Payment Service** field. Learn more at [Enable Customer Payments Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

You can even create directly paid invoices for unregistered customers by setting up a "cash customer" card for them, which you point to on the sales invoice. Learn more at [Set Up Cash Customers](finance-how-to-set-up-cash-customers.md).  

> [!TIP]
> If you want to send your customers reminders of overdue payments, you need to first set up reminder levels and terms. Learn more at [Set Up Reminder Terms and Levels](finance-setup-reminders.md).

# Sell products with a customer sales order

This article provides guidance on when you should use a customer sales order in addition to an invoice. If your sales process requires you to only ship part of an order, perhaps because the full quantity isn't available right away, you must process that sale by making a sales order.

You must also use sales orders if you sell items that deliver directly from your vendor to your customer, in what is called a drop shipment. To learn more, go to [Make Drop Shipments](sales-how-drop-shipment.md). In all other respects, sales orders work the same way as sales invoices. To learn more, go to [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).

When you deliver the products, either fully or partially, you post the sales order as shipped or as shipped and invoiced to create the related item and customer ledger entries in your system. When you post the sales order, you can also email it as a PDF attachment. You can prefill the email body with a summary of the order and payment information, such as a link to PayPal. To learn more, go to [Ship Items](warehouse-how-ship-items.md) and [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md).

In business environments where the customer pays immediately, such as via PayPal or cash, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records the payment when you post the sales invoice. The posted sales invoice is closed as fully applied. You select the method in the **Payment Method Code** field on the sales order. For electronic payments, such as PayPal, you must also fill in the **Payment Service** field. To learn more, go to [Enable Customer Payments Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

You can even create directly paid orders for unregistered customers by first setting up a "cash customer" card, which you point to on the sales order. To learn more, go to [Set Up Cash Customers](finance-how-to-set-up-cash-customers.md).

## Create a sales order

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedure assumes that the customer is already set up. To learn more about setting up customers, go to [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, then choose the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a new entry.
3. In the **Customer Name** field, enter the name of an existing customer.

    Other fields on the **Sales Order** page are now filled in with information about the selected customer.  

4. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Order** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you allow the customer to pay immediately, for example, by credit card or PayPal, then fill in the **Payment Method Code** field. The payment is then recorded as soon as you post the sales order as invoiced. If you select *cash*, then the payment is recorded in a specified balancing account.

    You're now ready to fill in the sales order lines with inventory items or services you want the customer to purchase.

    If you set up recurring sales lines for the customer, such as a monthly replenishment order, you can insert these lines on the order by choosing the **Get Recurring Sales Lines** action.
5. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select what type of product, charge, transaction, or comment you post to the customer on the sales line.

6. In the **No.** field, enter the number of an inventory item or service.

    Leave the **No.** field empty if the line is for a:

    * Comment. Write the comment in the **Description** field.
    * Catalog item. Choose the **Select Catalog Items** action. To learn more about catalog items, go to To learn more, go to [Work With Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).
7. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to be sold.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > For items of the *Resource* or *Service* type, the quantity is a time unit, such as hours, as indicated in the **Unit of Measure Code** field on the line. To learn more, go to [Set Up Item Units of Measure](inventory-how-setup-units-of-measure.md).

    The **Line Amount** field is updated to show the value in the **Unit Price** field multiplied by the number in the **Quantity** field.

    The price and line amounts are shown with or without sales tax depending on what you selected in the **Prices Including Tax** field on the customer card.
8. In the **Line Discount %** field, enter a percentage if you want to grant the customer a discount on the product. The value in the **Line Amount** field is updated accordingly.

    If you set up special item prices on the **Sales Prices and Sales Line Discounts** FastTab on the **Customer Card** or **Item Card** pages, the price and amount values on the sales lines update automatically if the criteria are met. To learn more about prices and discounts, go to [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).
9. To add a comment about the order line, that the customer can read on the printed sales order, write a comment on an empty line in the **Description** field.  
10. Repeat steps 5 through 9 for every item you want to the customer to purchase.

    The totals fields under the lines are automatically updated as you create or modify lines to display the amounts to be posted to the ledgers.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In rare cases, the posted amounts might differ from what is displayed in the totals fields. The difference is typically due to rounding calculations in relation to value-added tax (VAT) or sales tax.
    >
    > To double-check the amounts, use the **Statistics** page, which takes into account the rounding calculations. Also, if you choose the **Release** action, the totals fields update to include rounding calculations.  

11. Optionally, in the **Inv. Discount Amount** field, enter the amount to be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field.

    If you set up invoice discounts for the customer, the **Invoice Discount %** field automatically updates if the discount criteria are met. The **Inv. Discount Amount Excl. Tax** field shows related amount. To learn more, go to [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).
12. To ship only part of the order quantity, enter that quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field. The value automatically copies to the **Qty. to Invoice** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the **Shipping Advice** field is set as **Complete** in the **Shipping and Billing** FastTab, you can't post partial shipments. Learn more at [Process Partial Shipments](sales-how-send-partial-shipments.md).
13. To invoice only part of the shipped quantity, enter that quantity in the **Qty. to Invoice** field. The quantity must be lower than the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field.  
14. When the sales order lines are completed, choose the **Post and Send** action.

[!INCLUDE [order-ship-invoice](includes/order-ship-invoice.md)]

The **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box displays the customer's preferred method of receiving documents. You can change the sending method by choosing the lookup button for the **Send Document to** field. To learn more, go to [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).

The related item and customer ledger entries are now created, and the sales order is output as a PDF document. When the sales order is fully posted, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] removes it from the list of sales orders.  

## Create a new sales order based on a copy of another order

> [!TIP]
> This section describes how to copy a sales order, but the steps are the same for other sales documents.

When you're creating a sales order that's similar to a previous one, you can save time by copying the order you already have. For example, you can copy the data in the order's header, its lines, or both, to your new order. Afterward, you can update the information on the new order, if needed.

The value of some fields on an order's lines depend on what you enter in the header. For example, the values in the amount fields depend on the discounts you set up for the customer. If you don't include the header when you copy the order, you must recalculate the lines so that their values are appropriate to the header's values. The **Recalculate Lines** toggle turns on automatically if you turn off the **Include Header** toggle.

> [!NOTE]
> If the **Calc. Inv. Discount** option is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, the invoice discount recalculates when you post the new document line. The new calculation might cause the amount on the new line to differ from the original.

> [!NOTE]
> If part of the quantity on the original lines was returned, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates the new line with only the quantity that wasn't returned. If the full quantity was returned, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't create a new line.

### How to copy a sales order

The following steps describe how to copy a sales order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose **New** to create a new document, and then choose the **Copy Document** action.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When you copy an order, you can choose to copy only the information in the order's lines, and not copy the order header. Skipping the header might be useful, for example, when you're selling the same items and quantities to a different customer. If you skip the header, fill in the **Customer Name** field on your new order before you use the **Copy Document** action.

1. In the **Document Type** field, choose **Order**.
1. In the **Document No.** field, choose the order to copy.

   [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fills in the **Doc. NO. Occurrence**, **Version No.**, **Sell-to Customer No.**, and **Sell-to Customer Name** fields based on the order you choose.
1. To copy information in the order's header, such as the customer name and the order's due date, turn on the **Include Header** toggle.

   If you choose this option, you also copy the lines. However, you must recalculate the amounts on the lines in the new order.
1. To copy and recalculate the lines from the original order to the new, turn on the **Recalculate Lines** toggle.

   The action keeps the item numbers and item quantities, but recalculates the amounts based on the item prices and discounts for the customer on the new order.

1. Choose **OK** to create the copy.

# Receive items with warehouse receipts

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

To learn more about how to handle inbound items, go to [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

The following article refers to methods C and D in the previous table.

## Receive items with a warehouse receipt

When items arrive at a warehouse that processes warehouse receipts, get the lines of the document that triggered the receipt. If you use bins, you can either accept the default bin or specify the bin to put the items in. The latter might be required when you receive an item for the first time. Then, enter the quantities of the items you received and post the receipt.  

You can create warehouse receipt in one of two ways:

* In a push fashion, when work is done on an order-by-order basis. Choose the **Create Warehouse Receipt** action in the source document, such as a purchase order, sales return order, or transfer order to create a warehouse receipt for a source document.
* In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action in the source document, such as a purchase order, sales return order, or transfer order to release the document to the warehouse. A warehouse employee can create a **Warehouse Receipt** for one or more released source documents.

The following procedure describes how to create a warehouse receipt in a pull fashion.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Receipts**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  

    Fill in the **Location Code** field on the **General** FastTab. When you retrieve source document lines, some of the information is copied to each line.

    For a location that requires bins, fill in the **Bin Code** field. Depending on your setup, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can add the bin code for you. Learn more at [Zone and bin codes](warehouse-how-receive-items.md#zone-and-bin-codes).  

3. You can get source document in two ways:

    1. Choose the **Get Source Documents** action. The **Source Documents - Inbound** page opens. Here you can select one or more source documents released to warehouse that requires receipt.
    2. Choose the **Use Filters to Get Src. Docs.** action. The **Filters to Get Source Docs. - Inbound** page opens. Here you can select Source Document Filter and run it. All released source document lines that meet the filter criteria are added on the **Warehouse Receipt** page. Learn more at [How to Use Filters to Get Source Documents](warehouse-how-receive-items.md#how-to-use-filters-to-get-source-documents).

4. Set the quantity to receive.

    The **Qty. to Receive** field contains the quantity outstanding for each line, but you can change the quantity as needed. 

    To set the value in the **Qty. to Receive** field on all lines to zero, choose the **Delete Qty. to Receive** action. For example, setting the quantities to zero is useful if you're using a barcode scanner to update the received quantities. To add the outstanding quantities from the source document again, choose the **Autofill Qty. to Receive** action.  

    On a warehouse receipt document where the received quantity is higher than ordered, enter the quantity received in the **Qty. to Receive** field. If the increase is within the tolerance specified by an assigned over-receipt code, the **Over-Receipt Quantity** field updates to show the quantity by which the value in the **Quantity** field is exceeded. If the increase is over the tolerance, the over-receipt isn't allowed.

5. Post the warehouse receipt. The quantity fields are updated on the source documents, and the items are added to inventory.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-shipment](includes/preview-posting-shipment.md)]

    > [!TIP]
    > If you use warehouse put-aways (method D in the table in the beginning of this article), the items are received. However, you can't pick them until they're put away. To learn more about putting away items, go to [Put Items Away with Warehouse Put-aways](warehouse-how-to-put-items-away-with-warehouse-put-aways.md).
    >
    > Otherwise, consider using the **Post and Print** action. The action posts the receipt and prints it as a put-away instruction that shows where to put the item.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If your warehouse uses cross-docking, you can check whether you can cross-dock items without putting them away. To learn more about cross-docking, go to [Cross-Dock Items](warehouse-how-to-cross-dock-items.md).

## How to use filters to get source documents

From a warehouse receipt, you can use the **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page to retrieve the released source document lines that specify the items to receive.

1. In the warehouse receipt, choose the **Use Filters to Get Src. Docs.** action.
2. To set up a new filter, enter a descriptive code in the **Code** field, then choose the **Modify** action.

    The **Source Document Filter Card - Inbound** page appears.

3. Use the filters to define the type of source document lines to retrieve. For example, you can select types of source documents, such as purchase or transfer orders.
4. Choose **Run**.  

All released source document lines that meet the filter criteria are added on the **Warehouse Receipt** page on which you activated the filters.

You can make an unlimited number of filter combinations. Filters are saved on the **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page, and they're available the next time you need them. You can change the criteria at any time by choosing the **Modify** action.

## Zone and bin codes

To receive items with warehouse class codes other than the class code of the bin in the **Bin Code** field on the document header, clear the **Bin Code** field on the header before you retrieve source document lines for the items.  
<!-- TBD, table with comparison of various options-->

If bins are mandatory for a location, zone and bin codes are added to warehouse receipt documents as follows:

* For advanced configurations that use directed put-away and pick, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the receipt bin code from the **Location Card** page for the location. If a receipt bin code isn't specified, no bin is specified. If the item and receipt bins don't match, the receipt bin code is blank.
* In other configurations, if a receipt bin code isn't specified, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the bin code from the source document.

# Replan or refresh production orders directly

The **Replan** action on production orders is typically used after you add or change components that constitute underlying production orders. The action calculates changes made to components and routings lines, and includes items on lower production BOM levels for which it might generate new production orders.  

Based on the changes to the components and routing lines, the **Replan** action calculates and plans for any new demand for the production order.  

The **Refresh** action on production orders is typically used after you:

- Create a production order header manually to calculate and create line data for the first time.
- Change the production order header to recalculate all the line data.

The **Refresh** action calculates changes to a production order header and doesn't involve production BOM levels. The action calculates and initiates the values of the component lines and routing lines based on the production BOM and routing. The calculation is according to the order quantity and due date on the production order’s header.

You can either insert the production order lines manually or use the action that calculates the production order lines from the header.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you use the **Refresh** action to recalculate production order lines, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] deletes the existing production order lines and calculates new lines.
> Even if the **Lines** option is disabled, non-top-level lines in a Make-to-order environment are deleted. Use the **Replan** action to restore them.

## To replan a production order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the production order you want to replan.  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Lines** action, and then choose the **Components** action.  
4. Add a component that is a produced item or subassembly.  
5. From the production order, choose the **Replan** action.  

    On the **Replan Production Order** page, define how and what to replan.  
6. In the **Scheduling Direction** field, select one of the options in the following table.  

    | Option | Description |
    |--|--|
    | **Back** | Calculates the operation sequence backwards from the earliest possible ending date, defined by due date and/or other scheduled orders, to the latest possible starting date. **Note:**  This default option is relevant in most situations. |
    | **Forward** | Calculates the operation sequence forward from the earliest latest possible starting date, defined by due date and/or other scheduled orders, to the earliest possible ending date. **Note:**  This option is only relevant for expedite orders. |

7. In the **Plan** field, select whether to calculate production requirements for produced items on the production BOM. The following table describes the options.  

    |Option|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No Levels**|Don't consider lower level production. This setting only updates the item’s schedule, like refresh.|  
    |**One Level**|Plan for first-level production demand. First-level production orders might be created.|  
    |**All Levels**|Plan for all-level production demand. All-level production orders might be created.|  

8. Select **One Level**, and choose the **OK** button to replan the production order and calculate and create a new underlying production order for the introduced subassembly if it isn't fully available.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Changes implemented with the **Replan** action probably change the capacity need of the production order. You might have to reschedule operations afterwards.  

## To refresh a production order

If you change production order lines, components, or routing lines, you must also refresh the information on the production order. In the following procedure, the components are calculated for a firm planned production order. The steps are similar for routing lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. To learn more, go to [Create Production orders](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md).  
3. Choose the **Refresh** action.
4. On the **Refresh Production Order** page, select one of the options in the following table.

    |Field|Option|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Scheduling Direction**|**Forward**|Scheduling starts from the starting date and proceeds forward to the finishing date. You must fill in the starting date to use this option.|  
    ||**Backward**|Scheduling starts from the ending date and proceeds backward to the starting date.|  
    |**Calculate**|**Lines**|Select this field to calculate the production order lines.|  
    ||**Routings**|This field doesn't affect the calculations on production lines.|  
    ||**Component Need**|This field doesn't affect the calculations on production lines.|  
    |**Warehouse**|**Create Inbound Request**|This field doesn't affect the calculations on production lines.|  

5. Choose the **OK** button to confirm your selection. The production order lines are calculated.

> [!NOTE]  
> Calculating production order components deletes previous changes in the components.

## Reschedule production orders within a safety lead time

If you discover that you need the supply before the due date that planning set, you can manually reschedule the production order. To do that, you must turn on the **Manual Scheduling** toggle on the **Manufacturing Setup** page. If needed, in the **Safety Lead Time for Manual Scheduling** field, you can also specify an amount of buffer time to add to the end date when you manually reschedule a production order. You can move the due date to the current date or a future date, or change the end date directly by changing the starting date.

# Work with inventory periods

Inventory periods define a period of time in which you can post changes to inventory. An inventory period is defined by the date on which it ends, or the ending date. When you close an inventory period, you can't post any changes to inventory, either expected or invoiced, before this ending date. You can't post any new values to inventory before the ending date. If you have open item entries in the closed period, meaning positive quantities that haven't yet been applied to outbound transactions, you can still apply outbound quantities to these entries, even if the period is closed.  

The following sections describe how to:

* Create inventory periods.  
* Close inventory periods.  
* Reopen inventory periods.  

## To create an inventory period

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new line.  
3. In the **Ending Date** field, enter the last date in the inventory period that you want to define. When the period is closed, you won't be able to post inventory changes before this date.  
4. Enter a descriptive name in the **Name** field. Choose the **OK** button.  

## To close inventory periods

The **Closed** field indicates whether or not the inventory period is closed to inventory value changes. You can't edit this field.  

You can close any inventory period, if the following is true:  

* There are no open outbound item ledger entries, meaning negative inventory, in that period.  
* The cost of all items has been adjusted using the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job.  

This means that all outbound transaction quantities, such as those from sales orders, outbound transfers, sales invoices, purchase returns, or purchase credit memos, must be applied to existing quantity in inventory.  

### To close an inventory period  

1. Before closing an inventory period, choose the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** action to ensure that all cost adjustments are posted.

    Run the **Close Inventory Period – Test** report to determine if there are any open outbound item entries within the inventory period or any items whose cost hasn't yet been adjusted.  
2. Choose the **Test Report** action.  

    Run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job to ensure that all costs are posted to the general ledger.  
3. Choose the **Post Inventory to G/L** action.  
4. On the **Inventory Periods** page, select the inventory period you want to close.  
5. Choose the **Close Period** action. After the inventory period has been closed, you can't post inventory changes before the ending date. The cost of all items must be adjusted with the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job before you close the inventory period.  
6. Choose the **Yes** button to confirm that you want to close the period, or choose **No** to cancel the closing.  
7. The inventory period is closed and a confirmation message is displayed when it's finished.  

## Reopening inventory periods  
After you have closed the inventory period, you can't delete the inventory period. You can, however, reopen it, if you would like to allow posting before the ending date of the inventory period. Reopening a period also reopens all inventory periods with ending dates later than the period you reopen.  

### To reopen an inventory period  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the inventory period you want to reopen.  
3. Choose the **Reopen Period** period action. Confirm that you want to reopen the period.  
4. All inventory periods with ending dates later than the period you selected are reopened.

# Integrate with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service

Service organizations require a front-to-back application in which finance, inventory, and procurement are tightly coupled with service delivery. Every work order represents cost or revenue, and every resource generates profit or loss in the general ledger. The integration between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] streamlines the end-to-end process of managing service operations and ensures a smooth flow of information between the two applications.  

You can easily create and manage work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], track the progress of service tasks, assign resources, and capture consumption details. When you complete a work order in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], the integration enables the smooth transfer of data to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for further processing.  

The integration also lets you invoice and fulfill work orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can generate accurate invoices based on the service activities and the consumption recorded in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].  

By integrating [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], you don't have to enter data manually or duplicate efforts. Integration also provides a comprehensive view of service operations and finances, enabling better decision-making and operational efficiency.

## Types of integrations

Depending on the business processes you need, you can integrate [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] with project management features only, or project management and service management features in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> The **Project and Service** integration requires that you're using the Premium experience. Service management features aren't available in the Essential experience.
>
> The option to integrate with project management and service management is a package deal. That is, you can't integrate with service management features only. The option always integrates both sets of features.

For example, integrating [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] with project management lets you sync work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] with project journals in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can then use the project journal to post, for example, resource usage from the work order to the general ledger.

In addition to that, integrating [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] with both project and service management also gives you:

- Better scheduling and dispatching of service technicians based on their skills and ability.
- Improved tracking of repair parts and supplies for services.
- Accurate service estimates and invoices.

## Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]
> Most of these prerequisites apply to both types of integrations. However, there are some extra settings to integrate with service management features. To learn more about the settings, go to [Set up the integration with service management features](#set-up-the-integration-with-service-management-features).

### Integrate with Dataverse and Dynamics 365 Sales

To integrate with [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], you must:

- [Set up a connection to Dataverse](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection#to-use-the-dataverse-connection-setup-assisted-setup-guide).
- [Enable integration to Dynamics 365 Sales](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration#connection-settings-in-the-setup-guide).

:::image type="content" source="media/fs-integration-architecture.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the hierarchy of apps in the integration." lightbox="media/fs-integration-architecture.png":::

### Install required apps

You must download the following apps from AppSource, and install them in your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment:

- [Field Service Integration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2277917)
- [Business Central Virtual Table](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2304910)

> [!NOTE]
> The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Virtual Table app is optional. You only need it if you want to view information about item availability from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Optional: Make item availability information in Business Central available in Field Service](#optional-make-item-availability-information-in-business-central-available-in-field-service).

### Assign permissions and security roles to user accounts

When you install the Integration Solution, permissions for the integration user account are configured. The following sections list the permissions and security roles that the solution deploys for each app.

> [!TIP]
> If those permissions change, you might need to reset them. To do that, reinstall the Integration Solution from the **Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page by choosing **Redeploy Integration Solution**.

#### Sales

- Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration Administrator
- Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration User
- Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Product Availability User

#### Business Central

Users who post project journals must have the following permission set:

- Dynamics 365 Sales Integration

> [!NOTE]
> To integrate with project and service management, you must be using the **Premium** experience, which requires a license. To learn more about the license, go to the [Dynamics 365 licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544). When you have the license, on the **Company Information** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], set the **User Experience** field to **Premium**.

#### Field Service

To use the integrated data, users must have the following security role:

- Business Central Field Service Integration

For example, users must have this role to connect work orders to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for processing.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that users are assigned to the standard security roles and profiles in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].  
>
> To learn more about column security profiles in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], go to [Field Service security roles](/dynamics365/field-service/users-licenses-permissions#field-service-security-roles).
>
> Administrators must add one of the appropriate column security profiles to users in Power Platform. To learn more, go to [Add teams or users to a column security profile to control access](/power-platform/admin/add-teams-users-field-security-profile).

> [!NOTE]
> To use the **Open in Business Central** action in Sales, you must have the following permissions for the following tables:
>
> - You must have **Read** permissions for the **Dynamics 365 Business Central Connection** (nav_connection) table.
> - You must have **Read**, **Write**, and **Delete** permissions for the **Default Dynamics 365 Business Central Connection** (nav_defaultconnection) table.

## Set up the integration in Business Central

After you have a connection to Dataverse and Sales, you can set up your integration to [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

### Install the integration app, and run an assisted setup guide

1. Download and install the **Field Service Integration** app from [AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2277917). Afterward, on the **Extension Management** page, find the **Field Service Integration** app, and choose the **Set up** action to run the assisted setup guide.
2. On the **Assisted Setup** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose **Set up integration to Dynamics 365 Field Service** to run the assisted setup guide.

The following list points out the key settings in the guide.

- To let people post consumption of items and services in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] work orders, specify the **Project Journal Template** and **Project Journal Batch** to use to post consumption of products and services.
- Because services are expressed in duration in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], specify the **Hours Unit of Measure** to use to convert durations to quantities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- You can also specify when work order products and service lines synchronize to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, they might synchronize when work order lines are used, or when someone completes a work order. Choose the appropriate option in the **Synchronize work order products/services** field.
- After work order products and services synchronize to project journals in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can choose whether to post the project journals manually. Choose the appropriate option in the **Automatically post project journals lines** field:

   - When a work order is complete
   - When work order products or services are used

- Specify the **Integration Type** to integrate with project features only, or both project management and service management. The latter requires that you're using the Premium experience. To learn more, go to [Types of integrations](#types-of-integrations).
- Optionally, if you want to enable technicians to view information about item availability from work orders, choose the **Install Business Central Virtual Table app** link.

### Run a full synchronization

After you finish the setup, run a full synchronization from the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page. This action synchronizes table mappings for things like:

- Project tasks for projects with the **Apply Usage Link** set. This synchronization makes [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] projects available for selection in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].
- Resources that aren't blocked, don't have **Use Time Sheet** selected, and do have **Hours** specified as the unit of measure on the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page.
- Service-related documents, items, and entries (requires that you're using the Premium experience in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]).

#### Integration table mappings for synchronization

The basis of synchronizing data is mapping the tables and fields in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with tables and columns in Dataverse so they can exchange the data. Mapping happens through integration tables. To learn more about table mappings, go to [Mapping the Tables and Fields to Synchronize](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization).

When you finish the assisted setup guide, integration mappings are created. The following integration table mappings install if you choose the **Project (default)** integration type.

|Integration table mapping  |Data the mapping synchronizes  |
|---------|---------|
|**PJLINE-WORDERPRODUCT** | Maps work order products in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to project journal lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  |
|**PJLINE-WORDERSERVICE** |  Maps work order services in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to project journal lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  |
|**PROJECTTASK** |  Maps projects and project tasks in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to products in external projects in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].  |
|**RESOURCE-BOOKABLERSC**  | Maps resources in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to bookable resources in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. This mapping can also include resources that are users, which requires a few settings. To learn more, go to [Synchronize resources that are people with bookable resources](#synchronize-resources-that-are-people-with-bookable-resources).   |
|**LOCATIONS**     |  Maps locations in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to warehouses in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. <br><br> **Note:** The **LOCATIONS** integration table mapping is available only if you turn on the **Location Mandatory** toggle on the **Inventory Setup** page.      |

The following integration table mappings install if you choose the **Project and Service** integration type.

|Integration table mapping  |Data the mapping synchronizes  |
|---------|---------|
|**SRVORDER**| Maps service orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], including the status of the orders. |
|**SRVORDERITEMLINE**| Maps service item lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to work order incidents in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].|
|**SRVORDERLINE-ITEM**| Maps items on service order lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with work order products in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. |
|**SRVORDERLINE-RESOURCE**| Maps resources on service order lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with bookable resource booking in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].|
|**SRVORDERLINE-SERVICE**|Maps service lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with work order services in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. |
|**SRVORDERTYPE**| Maps service order types in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to work order types in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].|
|**SVCITEM-CUSTASSET**|Maps service items in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with customer assets in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].|

> [!NOTE]
> The integration also maps fields that show item availability information in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on work orders and products in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. However, the mapping happens through a virtual table, and not an integration table. Some setup is required. To learn more about virtual tables and viewing item availability, go to [Optional: Make item availability information in Business Central available in Field Service](#optional-make-item-availability-information-in-business-central-available-in-field-service).

> [!TIP]
> To enable technicians who work with the data on mobile devices, you must synchronize resources of the type **Person** in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with a **User** resource type in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Synchronize resources that are people with bookable resources](#synchronize-resources-that-are-people-with-bookable-resources).

## Set up the integration in Field Service

On the **Field Service Setting** page, make the following changes:

- On the **Purchase** tab, clear the **Use of Products Out of Stock** field. Otherwise, you might get an "out of stock" warning when you choose a product that's out of stock in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], but is in stock in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- On the **Work Order / Booking** tab, turn off the **Calculate Price** and **Calculate Cost** toggles. In the **Work Order Invoice Creation** field, choose **Never**.

## Synchronize resources that are people with bookable resources

You can synchronize resources of the type **Person** in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with bookable resources in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] that are the **User** type. The synchronization is bi-directional.

> [!NOTE]
> On the **Integration Table Mapping** page, by default, for the **RESOURCE-BOOKABLESC** mapping the **Resource Type** field contains **Generic|Account|Equipment|User**. If you're upgrading your existing integration, you might have to add that value.

1. On the **User Setup** page, add an email address for the user that you want to link with the bookable resource. The address must match the address from the user on the tenant where your Dataverse environment is located.
1. On the **Resource Card** page, in the **Time Sheet Owner User ID** field, choose the user.
1. Synchronize the resource manually, or wait until the job queue synchronizes resources with bookable resources.
1. To verify the synchronization, in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], open the **Bookable Resource** page and find the resource.

## Integrate project and service management features

Integrating [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] lets you manage service tasks, consumption, and financial transactions to benefit service technicians, service managers, and finance teams. It's a powerful solution for managing work orders and consumption in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] and efficiently invoicing and fulfilling them in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The integration is bi-directional, meaning that when you enter or change data in either app, the data updates in the other.

> [!NOTE]
> When you enable the integration with service management features, you also enable the integration with projects. You can't enable only the service management integration.

### Set up the integration with service management features

You can enable the integration in the **Integration Type** field by selecting **Project and Service** in the following places:

- In the **Set up integration to Dynamics 365 Field Service** assisted setup guide.
- On the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page.

When the **Integration Type** field is set to **Project and Service**, the following things happen when you enable the integration:

- Creates a solution in Power Apps named **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Field Service Integration (service)**.
- Adds integration table mappings for service order types, service documents, service lines, and service item lines. To learn more about the table mappings, go to [Integration table mappings for synchronization](#integration-table-mappings-for-synchronization).
- Fields in the headers on service orders and work orders transfer information, such as the **Service Account**, **Billing Account**, and **Work Order Type**.
- **Service Item Lines** and **Work Order Incidents** in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] transfer information about the customer assets being repaired.
- **Service Line** fields and **Work Order Products** and **Work Order Services** fields, such as **Qty. to Ship**, **Qty. to Invoice**, and **Qty. to Consume**.

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], make the following settings on the **Service Management Setup** page:

- Turn on the **Service Order Type Mandatory** toggle. This setting is required because [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] requires a work order type.
- Make sure that the number series you use for service orders is set up to allow manual numbering. On the **No. Series** page, select the **Manual Nos.** checkbox for the number series. Manual numbering lets you create work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] and synchronize them with service orders. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the order number from [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].
- Turn off the **One Service Item Line/Order** toggle. This setting lets you have more than one work item line.
- Turn on the **Archive Orders** toggle.
- Make the **Service Order Type** field on service orders mandatory because the **Work Order Type** is mandatory on [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] work orders.

If you choose **Enable Inventory Availability by Location** when you set up the integration, you can view the allocated product quantity from work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] as part of the gross requirements in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s inventory availability calculation. Demand generated by orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] automatically becomes input for planning through synchronized service orders.

The status of service and work orders changes as they progress toward completion. The following table shows how the statues align in both apps.

|[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] status  |[!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] status  | Alignment |
|---------|-----------|---------|
|Pending  |Unscheduled| Bidirectional per mapping to account for item demand. |
|Pending  |Scheduled  | [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Synchronizes the quantity to ship and the quantity to invoice.|
|In process | In progress | [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Synchronizes the quantity to ship and the quantity to invoice. |
|Finished | Completed     | [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Ready for posting in Business Central. |
|Finished | Posted        | [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When fully invoiced or deleted after partial invoicing in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|
|N/A     | Canceled      | Not synchronized. Manual alignment is needed for canceled work orders. |

### Upgrade your integration to include service management features

If you set up the integration to only include projects, but decide to add service management features later, that's easy to do in just a few steps. Remember that you must be using the Premium experience.

1. On the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page, turn off the **Enabled** toggle.
1. In the **Integration Type** field, choose **Project and Service**.
1. Turn on the **Enabled** toggle.

## Optional: Make item availability information in Business Central available in Field Service

When technicians prepare work orders, it's helpful that they're sure that the items they need to do the work are available. This section describes how to set up things so people can view item availability information from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

### Synchronize location and warehouse data

You can integrate [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] warehouses with locations in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The integration gives technicians information about the availability of a product or item at a specific location.

The data synchronizes from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through a unidirectional integration table mapping between locations in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and warehouses in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. To use the integration table mapping, you must turn on the **Location Mandatory** toggle on the **Inventory Setup** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] synchronizes locations with the following settings on the **Location Card** page:

- The **Use as In-Transit** toggle is turned off.
- **Project Consump. Whse. Handling** is different from Warehouse Pick (mandatory).
- **Assm. Consump. Whse. Handling** is different from Warehouse Pick (mandatory).

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Locations** and **Location Card** page, you can use the **Warehouse** action to open a coupled location in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], synchronize it, set up and delete couplings, and view synchronization logs.

### Set up virtual tables

A virtual table is a custom table that has columns and rows that contain data from an external data source, such as [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The columns and rows in a virtual table look like a regular table, however, the data isn't stored in a physical table in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] database. Instead, the data is retrieved at runtime. To learn more about virtual tables, go to [Use virtual tables to get more data](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#use-virtual-tables-to-get-more-data).

To use virtual tables in your integration, the first thing to do is to install the [Business Central Virtual Table](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2277917) app from AppSource.

> [!NOTE]
> Your [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] must be in the same tenant. That's a requirement for using virtual tables.

Afterward, on the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** or **Set up integration to Dynamics 365 Field Service** pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], turn on the **Enable Inventory Availability by Location** toggle. When you enable inventory availability by location, a **dyn365bc_availabilitybylocation_v2_0** virtual table becomes available. You must create a synthetic relation between the following tables:

- The native **Product** and **Work Order Product** tables in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] and the **Item Availability** virtual table that shows item availability.

There's an assisted setup guide to help you create the synthetic relation. To create the synthetic relation, follow these steps:

1. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page, use the **Synthetic Relations** action.
1. On the **Synthetic Relations** page, choose the **New** action to start the **New Synthetic Relation** assisted setup guide.
1. In the **Native Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **CRM Product**.
1. In the **Virtual Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **Inventory Availability by Location**.
1. On the **Synthetic Relations** page, choose the **New** action to start the **New Synthetic Relation** assisted setup guide again.
1. In the **Native Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **FS Work Order Product**.
1. In the **Virtual Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **Inventory Availability by Location**.
1. Choose **Next**.
1. In the **Field in the FS Work Order Product table** field, choose **Product Id**.
1. In the **Field in the Item Availability by Location table** field, choose **itemNo**.
1. Choose **Finish** to complete the guide.
1. To make your setup available in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], in the **Power Apps admin center**, choose the view, and then choose the **Save and Publish** action.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take a few moments to create the synthetic relations.

### Set up the view in Field Service

The next thing to do is to create and customize the view that people use in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to check the inventory of products.

To create the view in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], follow these steps:

1. In **Power Apps admin center**, on the navigation pane, choose **Tables**.
1. Choose the **Item Availability by Location** table.
1. In the **Data experiences** part, choose **Views**.
1. Choose the **View column** action, and then choose the columns you want the view to include. The following columns are typical choices:

    - **Location Code** shows where the product is available.
    - **Item No.** confirms you're looking at the correct product.
    - **Item Description** provides information about the product.
    - **Unit of Measure Code** gives you an idea of the space you need.
    - **Remaining Quantity** shows how much of the product is available at each location.

# Troubleshoot and correct dimensions

Financial reporting and analysis views often rely on data from dimensions. Despite the safeguards that are available, sometimes a mistake happens that can lead to inaccuracies. This article describes some of the typical errors, and explains how to correct dimension assignments on posted transactions so that financial reports are accurate.

## Troubleshooting dimensions errors

When you post documents or journal lines that contain dimensions, various errors might occur. However, they're typically related to an incorrect dimension setup or assignment.

> [!NOTE]
> In the following list of potential error messages, the *%X* codes are placeholders for the data variables that the actual message will contain in the UI depending on the context. For example, *%1 %2 is blocked.* could appear in the UI as "Dimension Code AREA is blocked.".  

|Issue|Error Message|Possible Solution|
|-----|-------------|-----------------|
|Blocked dimension|%1 %2 is blocked.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension and unblock it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the blocked dimension.|
|Deleted dimension|%1 %2 can't be found.|-Restore the missing dimension.<br />-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the missing dimension and add it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the missing dimension.|
|Blocked dimension value|%1 %2 - %3 is blocked.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension value and unblock it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the blocked dimension value.|
|Deleted dimension value|    %1 for %2 is missing.|-Restore the missing dimension value.<br />-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the missing dimension value and add it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the missing dimension value.|
|Disallowed dimension value|Dimension Value Type for %1 %2 - %3 must not be %4.|-Change the **Dimension Value Type** field on the **Dimension Values** page to **Standard** or **Begin-Total**.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the blocked dimension value.|
|Blocked dimension combination|Dimensions %1 and %2 can't be used concurrently.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension combination and unblock it.<br />-Modify one of the conflicting permission set lines for the dimension combination.|
|Blocked dimension value Combination|Dimension combinations %1 - %2 and %3 - %4 can't be used concurrently.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension value combination and unblock it.<br />-Modify one of the conflicting permission set lines for the dimension value combination.|
|Blank dimension value code for default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **Code Mandatory**|-Select a %1 for the %2 %3.<br />-Select a %1 for the %2 %3 for %4 %5.|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Enter a nonblank dimension value for the conflicting dimension in the dimension set.|
|Wrong dimension value code for default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **Same Code**|-Select %1 %2 for the %3 %4.<br />-Select %1 %2 for the %3 %4 for %5 %6|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Enter the required dimension value for the conflicting dimension in the dimension set.|
|Nonblank dimension value code for blank default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **Same Code**|-%1 %2 must be blank.<br />-%1 %2 must be blank for %3 %4.|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Enter a blank dimension value code for the conflicting dimension in the dimension set.|
|Unexpected dimension value for default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **No Code**|-%1 %2 must not be mentioned.<br />-%1 %2 must not be mentioned for %3 %4|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Remove the conflicting line from the dimension set.|
|A dimension correction doesn't complete correctly.||-Choose **Reset** to revert the correction to a draft state. This resets the changes, and you can run the correction again.|

## Changing dimension assignments after posting

If you discover an incorrect dimension on posted general ledger entries, you can correct the dimension values and update your analysis views. The correction helps keep your financial reports and analyses accurate.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The features for correcting dimensions are intended only to help make financial reporting accurate. Dimension corrections apply only to the G/L entries. They do not change the dimensions assigned to the entries in other ledgers for the same transaction. There will be a mismatch between the dimensions assigned in the general ledger and the sub-ledgers.

### Set up dimension corrections

There are two things to consider when setting up dimension corrections:

* Are there dimensions that you don't want to allow people to change? On the **Dimension Correction Settings** page, specify the dimensions that you want to block for changes.
* Who can change dimensions? To allow people to make changes, assign the **D365 DIM CORRECTION** permission to the users. The permissions allow them to create dimension corrections, run them, and undo them if needed. They can also specify blocked dimensions. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md). 

### Correct a dimension

You can manually select one or more general ledger entries, or use filters to select sets of entries. If needed, you can also add or delete dimensions. 

1. To start a dimension correction, use one the following pages:

    * On the **G/L Registers** page, by selecting a register, and then choosing the **Correct Dimensions** action. This action starts a correction for the entries in the selected register.
    * On the **General Ledger Entries** page, by choosing the **Correct Dimensions** action. 

2. In the **Description** field, enter information about the change. Other people might use this information later to understand what was done.
3. On the **Selected Ledger Entries** FastTab, choose the relevant entries.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When you change a selection, the values on the **Dimension Correction Changes** FastTab are reset. Therefore, always select the entries before you specify dimension value changes.

   The following table describes the options.

   |Option  |Description  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Add Related Entries     |Add G/L entries that are in the same G/L register.|   
   |Add by Filter     |Use filter criteria when adding G/L entries.|
   |Manual Selection     |Select specific G/L entries.         |
   |Add by Dimensions     |Filter G/L entries by dimensions.         |
   |Remove Entries     |Deselect G/L entries.         |
   |Manage Selection Criteria     |Keep track of the selection process, and undo selections if needed.         |

4. On the **Dimension Correction Changes** FastTab, choose the dimension that you want to change in the **Dimension Code** field, and the new value in the **New Dimension Value Code** field.
5. To validate that the correction, choose **Validate Dimension Changes**. For more information, see [Validating Dimension Corrections](finance-troubleshooting-correcting-dimensions.md#validate-dimension-corrections).
6. Choose **Run**.

### Validate dimension corrections

Before you run a correction, it's a good idea to validate it first. Validation checks for restrictions on value posting for the G/L accounts, restrictions for dimensions, and whether the dimension values are blocked. During validation, the status of the correction is set to **Validation in Process**. After you validate a correction, the result is shown in the **Validation Status** field. If errors were found, you can use the **View Errors** action to investigate them. After you correct an error, you must use the **Reopen** action to run the correction or a new validation.

You can either run a correction immediately, or schedule it to run a later time. If you're running corrections on a large data set, we recommend that you schedule it to run outside business hours. For more information, see [Dimension Corrections on Large Data Sets](finance-troubleshooting-correcting-dimensions.md#dimension-corrections-on-large-data-sets).

### Undo a correction

After you correct a dimension, if you don't like what you see you can use the **Undo** action to reset the previous value. However, you can only undo the most recent correction. Before you undo a correction, you can validate the changes that result from the undo action. For example, validation is useful if dimension restrictions changed after the correction was made.

If the Undo action isn't available, for example because you have many corrections, you can use the **Copy to Draft** action to start a new correction for the same entries.

### Dimension corrections on large data sets

Use caution when correcting large sets of entries, for example, sets that include more than 10,000 entries. If you can, we recommend that you use the filters to run the corrections on smaller sets of data. It's also a good idea to run corrections outside the normal business hours. 

### Use analysis views with dimension corrections

If **Update on Posting** is enabled for an analysis view, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can update the view when documents and journals are posted. You can also update views with this setting enabled with results of dimension corrections. To do so, turn on the **Update Analysis Views** toggle. Updating analysis views can affect performance, especially for large data sets, so we recommend that you update analysis views only for small data sets.  

### View historical dimension corrections

If a general ledger entry was corrected, you can investigate the change by using the **History of Dimension Corrections** action.

### Handle incomplete corrections

If a correction doesn't complete, a warning displays on the correction card. If that happens, you can use the **Reset** action to revert the correction to a draft status and undo the changes. You can then run the correction again.

> [!NOTE]
> Resetting an incomplete correction will not affect updates to analysis views because those happen at the end of the correction process.

### Use cost accounting with corrected G/L entries

After you correct dimensions, your data for cost accounting is out of sync. Cost accounting uses dimensions to aggregate amounts for cost centers and cost objects, and to run cost allocations. Changing dimensions for G/L entries probably means that you should rerun your cost accounting models. Depending on the data that was updated and how your cost accounting capabilities are set up, you might need to:

* Delete just a few cost registers and rerun allocations.
* Delete everything and rerun all of your models.

You must manually identify where dimension corrections affect cost accounting, and where updates are needed. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't currently provide an automated way to do that.

# Quote an Assemble-to-Order Sale

You can use assembly management to customize an assembly item to a customer's request during the sales process. For more information, see [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

As when you sell any other type of item, you can also create a sales quote for a customized assembly item before converting it to a sales order. This process involves several extra steps when you compare it to creating a regular sales quote, and it uses a variation of a linked assembly order, which is an assembly quote.

> [!NOTE]  
>  Like all types of quotes, the quantities on assembly quotes are not used in availability, planning, or reservations.  

## To create a sales quote for an assemble-to-order item

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Quote**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Create a sales quote line with one line for an assembly item. For more information, see [Make Sales Quotes](sales-how-make-offers.md).  
3.  In the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field, enter the full quantity.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You should not quote a partial quantity. Therefore, you must enter the same quantity that you entered in the **Quantity** field on the sales quote line.  

4.  On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Line**, choose **Assemble to Order**, and then choose **Assemble-to-Order Lines**. Alternatively, choose the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the line.  
5.  On the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page, review or modify the assembly order lines according to the quote that the customer is requesting. If you want to view more information, choose the **Show Document** action to open the complete blanket quote order. You cannot change the contents of most fields, and you cannot post.  
6.  When you have adjusted the assembly order lines according to the quote, close the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page to return to the **Sales Quote** page.  
7.  If the customer accepts the quote, then create a sales order for the quoted assembly item. For more information, see [Make Sales Quotes](sales-how-make-offers.md). The linked assembly quote and any customizations are linked to that new sales order to prepare for assembly of the item or items to be sold.

# Status Field on Documents

When you create a quote, order, or credit memo, the **Status** field on the document header contains the status **Open** by default.

After you've filled in the document, you can release it, and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] changes the value in the **Status** field to **Released**. This status indicates that the order is ready for the next stage of processing before it's posted.

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Open   | You can make changes to the document. |
| Released | The document has been released to the next stage of processing, and you can't make changes to lines of type *Item* and *Fixed Asset*.<br /><br />You can reopen a released document if you want to make changes to its contents. To move the adjusted document to the next stage of processing, you must once again release the document. |
| Pending Approval   | The document is waiting to be approved. |
| Pending Prepayment | A prepayment invoice has been posted for the document. |

## Release process

You can use the release process in different ways to ease your normal workflow, for example, to follow company procedures about approvals or to start warehouse activities.

### Approval procedures

Your company can use the release procedure to indicate that another user has approved the document or that an external contact can meet the specifications of the document, as shown in these examples:

* You can only release a purchase order when your vendor has indicated that they're prepared to fulfill the order.
* You create an order and a second user must approve it, perhaps for security reasons, before you're allowed to release it.
* The manager responsible for approving all refunds must release a credit memo that you've created.

Learn more about approval workflows at [Use Workflows](across-use-workflows.md).

### Warehouse activities

If the order status is **Open**, the warehouse won't begin to prepare the shipment, and doesn't expect to receive the items on a purchase order. When you release the order, you indicate that the order is complete, and that the warehouse can include it in its activities.

## Reopen a released order

You can make changes to a released order by reopening it. However, you can only increase the quantity of the lines already processed by the warehouse.

When you make the changes and release the order again, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recalculates the value-added tax (VAT) and the invoice discount.

If you make changes to a released order, you must notify the warehouse about the changes.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to post a single open order or credit memo without releasing it first, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically release the document when you post it. If you post your orders or credit memos by using the **Post Batch** function, you can choose to post only the orders or credit memos that you've released.

# Design Details: Item Tracking Lines Page
Item tracking records and reservation records are created in the reservation system, and their availability is calculated dynamically. Data that is entered on the **Item Tracking Lines** page is managed in a temporary version of the **Tracking Specification** table. When the page is closed, the active data is committed to the **Reservation Entry** table and the historic data is committed to the **Tracking Specification** table. For more information, see [Design Details: Active versus Historic Item Tracking Entries](design-details-active-versus-historic-item-tracking-entries.md).  
  
Lookups from the **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields show availability based on both the **Item Ledger Entry** table and the **Reservation Entry** table, with no date filter. The matrix of quantity fields on the header of the **Item Tracking Lines** page dynamically displays the quantities and sums of item tracking numbers that are being entered on the lines of the page. The quantities must correspond to those of the document line, which is indicated by **0** in the **Undefined** fields in the header of the page.  
  
To coordinate the flow of serial and lot numbers through inventory, the following rules exist for entering data on the **Item Tracking Lines** page:  
  
* For both inbound and outbound item tracking lines, you cannot enter a serial number, with or without a lot number, more than once in the same instance of the **Item Tracking Lines** page. If you try to enter any combination of serial or lot numbers that is already present on the page, then an error message blocks the data entry.  
* For inbound item tracking lines, you cannot post the related document if an item of the same variant and with the same serial number is already in inventory. If you try to post a positive line for an inventory item with the same variant and serial number, then an error message blocks the posting. However, for both inbound and outbound item tracking lines on open documents, you can have the same combination of serial or lot numbers that relate to different source document lines, that is, existing in different instances of the **Item Tracking Lines** page until the related document is posted.  
* If the item is set up for serial number-specific tracking or lot number- specific tracking, then you cannot post an outbound document line unless an item with the defined serial or lot number exists in inventory. If you try to post an outbound document line for an item with a serial lot number that is not in inventory, then an error message blocks the posting.  
  
The rules for entering data on the **Item Tracking Lines** page also support the coupling principles that govern order tracking, planning, and reservation. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Tracking and Planning](design-details-item-tracking-and-planning.md).

# Export and Import Approval Workflows

To transfer workflows to other [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] databases, for example to save time when creating new workflows, you can export and import workflows.  

Another way to quickly create workflows is to use workflow templates. Learn more at [Create Workflows from Workflow Templates](across-how-to-create-workflows-from-workflow-templates.md).  

On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios supported by the application code. Learn more at [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).  

## Export a workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select a workflow, then choose the **Export to File** action.  

## Import a workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Import from File** action.  
3. On the **Import** page, select **Choose**, choose the XML file containing the workflow, then select **Open**.  

> [!CAUTION]  
> If the workflow code already exists in the database, the workflow steps will be overwritten with the steps in the imported workflow.

# Setting up fixed assets

Before you can work with fixed assets (FA), you need to define a few things:  

* How you depreciate fixed assets.  
* How you record acquisition costs, depreciations, and other values in the general ledger.  
* Optionally, how to record insurance and maintenance on fixed assets.

The sections in this article link to more information about how to set up fixed assets. After you finish the setup, you can start working with fixed assets. For more information, see [Using Fixed Assets](fa-manage.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can record fixed asset transactions in the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** or **Fixed Asset Journal** pages, depending on whether the transactions are for financial reporting or for internal management. The help articles for fixed assets only describes how to use the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page.  

When you enable a fixed asset activity in the **G/L Integration** section on the **Depreciation Book Card** page, use the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page to post transactions for the activity.

## Required setup tasks

The following table contains a sequence of tasks to set up fixed assets, and links to related articles.

| To... | Go to... |
|---|---|
| Set-up default G/L accounts, allocation keys, journal templates and batches for fixed asset posting, and set up fixed asset classes and subclasses, such as Tangible and Intangible. |[Set Up General Fixed Assets Information](fa-how-setup-general.md) |
| Create depreciation books, define various depreciation methods, integrate with the general ledger, and enable duplication of entries in several depreciation books. |[Set Up Fixed Asset Depreciation](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md) |

## Optional setup tasks (insurance, maintenance, and user-defined depreciation methods)

The following table contains a sequence of optional tasks to set up fixed assets, such as insurance, maintenance and depreciation methods, and links to related articles. 

| To... | Go to... |
|---|---|
| Enable insurance of fixed assets, set up general insurance information, an insurance card per policy, and prepare journals to post insurance costs. |[Set Up Fixed Asset Insurance](fa-how-setup-insurance.md) |
| Enable maintenance of fixed assets, set up general maintenance information, set up maintenance posting accounts, and define types of maintenance work. |[Set Up Fixed Asset Maintenance](fa-how-setup-maintenance.md) |

# Closing the books
After you ensure that all your accounts are up-to-date, and you allocate costs and income, then you can close the books for a fiscal year or period.

You aren't required to close a year, but doing so will make working in the system easier for you because you'll be able to take advantage of the convenient filtering options provided. You also don't have to worry about losing details of transactions when you close because all details are retained, even after you close the year.

## Closing book process
The process for closing the book includes these main tasks:

1. Closing the accounting period.

    A fiscal year is defined as one or more open periods as defined on the **Accounting Periods** page. A typical fiscal year contains 12 periods of one month each, but you can also choose another method of defining a year.

    For more information, see [Close Accounting Periods](year-close-account-periods.md).
2. Registering prior-year entries.

    When you close a fiscal year, you must enter a number of administrative transactions (such as prepaid and accrued items). These transactions are called adjusting entries. There are no special rules for posting these entries, and they (like other entries) contain a check mark in the **Prior-Year Entry** field if they're posted on a date in a closed fiscal year. Even though a fiscal year has been closed, you can still post general ledger entries to it.
3. Transferring balances from the income statement accounts to the balance sheet.

    After a fiscal year has been closed and all prior-year entries have been posted, the income statement accounts must be closed and the net income for the year must be transferred to an account under owners' equity on the balance sheet. Use the Close Income Statement batch job for this purpose. The batch job processes all general ledger accounts of the type Income Statement and creates entries that reverse their balances. These entries are placed in a journal from which they can be posted. The batch job doesn't post them automatically, except when an additional reporting currency is used. When an additional reporting currency is used, the batch job posts directly to the general ledger.

    For more information, see [Close Income Statement](year-close-income-statement.md).
4. Posting the year-end closing entry along with the offsetting equity account entries.

    When the Close Income Statement batch job is finished, you post the entries generated by the job. If you didn't specify a retained earnings account in the batch job, then enter one line with a balancing entry that posts the net income to the correct general ledger account under owners' equity on the balance sheet. Finally, post the journal.

    For more information, see [Post Year-End Closing Entry](year-how-post-year-end-close-entry.md).

## What happens when you close

When you close at the end of the year, the system moves your earnings from calculated earnings to the Retained Earnings account. The system also marks the fiscal year as "closed," and marks all subsequent entries for the closed year as "prior year entries."

The system then generates a closing entry, but it doesn't post the entry automatically. You're given the opportunity to make the offsetting equity account entry or entries, which allows you to decide how to allocate your closing entry. For example, if your company has several divisions, you can let the system generate a single closing entry for all the divisions, and you can then make an offsetting entry for each division's equity account.

You can post in a previous fiscal year, even after the income statement accounts have been closed, if you run the Close Income Statement batch job again afterward.

# Set Up Finance Charge Terms

When a customer does not pay by the due date, you can have finance charges calculated automatically and add them to the overdue amounts on the customer's account. You can inform customers of the added charges by sending finance charge memos. But first, you must set up a code that represents each finance charge calculation. Then you can enter this code in the Fin. Charge Terms Code field on customer cards.  

## Finance charge terms

You must set up finance charge terms for each finance charge calculation, and then assign the terms to the customer in the **Fin. Charge Terms Code** field on the **Customer** page.

Finance charges can be calculated using either the average daily balance or the balance due methods.

* Average daily balance  
  
  The number of days the payment is overdue is taken into account:  
  *Average Daily Balance method* - *Finance Charge* = *Overdue Amount* x *(Days Overdue / Interest Period)* x *(Interest Rate/100)*

* Balance due  
  
  The finance charge is a percentage of the overdue amount:  
  *Balance Due method* - *Finance Charge* = *Overdue Amount* x *(Interest Rate / 100)*

Additionally, each term in the Finance Charge Terms table is linked to a subtable, the Finance Charge Text table. For each set of finance charge terms, you can define a beginning and/or an ending text to include on the finance charge memo.

### To set up finance charge terms

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Finance Charge Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.
3. To use more than one combination of finance charge terms, set up a code for each one.

    For each finance charge term, you can specify individual conditions that can include additional fees in both LCY and in foreign currency. You can define additional fees in foreign currencies for each term on the **Finance Charge Terms** page.
4. Choose the **Currencies** action.
5. On the **Currencies for Fin. Chrg. Terms** page, define for each term a currency code and an additional fee.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you create finance charges in a foreign currency, the foreign currency conditions that you set up here will be used to create finance charge memos. If there are no foreign currency finance charge conditions set up, the LCY finance charge conditions specified on the **Finance Charge Terms** page will be used and then converted to the relevant currency.

    For each finance charge term, you can specify text that will be printed before (**Beginning Text**) or after (**Ending Text**) on the entries on the finance charge memo.  
6. Choose the **Beginning Text** or **Ending Text** actions respectively, and fill on the **Finance Charge Text** page.
7. To automatically insert related values in the resulting finance charge text, enter the following placeholders in the **Text** field.

|Placeholder|Value|  
|-----------------|-----------|  
|%1|Content of the **Document Date** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%2|Content of the **Due Date** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%3|Content of the **Interest Rate** field on the related finance charge terms|  
|%4|Content of the **Remaining Amount** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%5|Content of the **Interest Amount** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%6|Content of the **Additional Fee** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%7|The total amount of the reminder|  
|%8|Content of the **Currency Code** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%9|Content of the **Posting Date** field on the finance charge memo header|

# Design Details: Posting Engine Structure
Posting interface and some other functions in codeunit 12 use posting engine functions to prepare and insert general ledger entry and VAT entry records. The posting engine is also responsible for general ledger register creation.  
  
 The functions in the following table provide a standard framework for designing posting procedures (such as Code, CustPostApplyCustledgEntry, VendPostApplyVendLedgEntry, UnapplyCustLedgEntry, UnapplyVendLedgEntry, and Reverse) and exclusive access to table 17, G/L Entry.  
  
|Routine|Description|  
|-------------|---------------------------------------|  
|StartPosting|Initializes posting buffer TempGLEntryBuf, locks G/L Entry and VAT Entry tables, and initializes Accounting Period, G/L Register, and Exchange Rate. Should be called only once, then NextEntryNo is 0.|  
|ContinuePosting|Checks and posts unrealized VAT for previous transaction increment NextTransactionNo and prepares post of next line.|  
|FinishPosting|Completes posting by inserting G/L entries from temporary buffer into database table. Always used together with StartPosting. Checks for inconsistencies.|  
|InitGLEntry|Used to initialize new G/L entry for Gen. Jnl Line. Returns GLEntry as parameter.|  
|InitGLEntryVAT|Same as InitGLEntry, but also assigns Bal. Account No. and SummarizeVAT.|  
|InitGLEntryVATCopy|Similar to InitGLEntryVAT, but also copies posting groups data from VAT Entry before SummarizeVAT.|  
|InsertGLEntry|The only function that inserts G/L entry into global TempGLEntryBuf table. Always use this function for insert.|  
|CreateGLEntry|Performs an InitGLEntry, assigns Additional Currency Amount, and then performs InsertGLEntry. Replaces several lines of code with a single function call.|  
|CreateGLEntryBalAcc|Same as CreateGLEntry, but also assigns Bal. Account Type and Bal. Account No.|  
|CreateGLEntryVAT|Same as CreateGLEntry, but with additional processing for posting groups and saving to temporary VAT buffer:<br /><br /> `GLEntry.CopyPostingGroupsFromDtldCVBuf(DtldCVLedgEntryBuf,GenJnlLine."Gen. Posting Type");`<br /><br /> `InsertVATEntriesFromTemp(DtldCVLedgEntryBuf,GLEntry);`|  
|CreateGLEntryVATCollectAdj|Same as CreateGLEntry, but with additional collection of adjustments and saving to temporary VAT buffer:<br /><br /> `CollectAdjustment(AdjAmount,GLEntry.Amount,GLEntry."Additional-Currency Amount",OriginalDateSet);`<br /><br /> `InsertVATEntriesFromTemp(DtldCVLedgEntryBuf,GLEntry);`|  
|CreateGLEntryFromVATEntry|Same as CreateGLEntry, but also copies posting groups from VAT entry.|

# Allocate recurring costs and income

You can allocate an entry in a recurring general journal to several accounts when you post the journal. To learn more about recurring general journals, go to [Work with recurring journals](ui-work-general-journals.md#work-with-recurring-journals).

The following allocation methods are available:

* Quantity
* Percentage (%)
* Amount

The allocation features work with recurring general journals and in fixed asset journals.
<!--You can also distribute the cost or revenue of a line to an intercompany partner when you post a sales or purchase document. When you post the document, a line will be posted in your general journal, and a corresponding line will be created in the intercompany outbox.-->

The following procedures describe how to prepare to allocate costs in a recurring general journal by defining allocation keys. When allocation keys are defined, you complete and post the journal like any other recurring general journal. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Allocation Accounts** aren't supported in recurring journals. While the **Allocation Account** option is available in the **Account Type** field on the lines of the journal, this option isn't supported. Instead, use the allocations feature as described in this article.
>
> If you defined allocation accounts in a previous version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], update the setup to use allocations.

## To set up allocation keys

You can allocate an entry in a recurring general journal to several different accounts when you post the journal. The allocation can be a quantity, percentage, or amount.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Batch Name** field to open the **General Journal Batches** page.
3. You can either modify allocations on an existing batch in the list or create a new batch with allocations.
   * To create a new batch, choose the **New** action, and go to the next step.
   * To change the allocations of an existing journal, select the journal and go to step 7.    
4. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the batch, such as CLEANING. In the **Description** field, enter a description, such as Cleaning Expenses Journal.
5. When you're done, close the page. A new, empty recurring journal opens.
6. Fill in the fields on the line.
7. Choose the **Allocations** action.
8. Add a line for each allocation. You must fill in either the **Allocation %**, **Allocation Quantity**, or **Amount** field. You must also fill in the **Account No.** field and, if you're allocating the transaction among global dimensions, the global dimension fields.
9. If you enter a percentage on a line, the amount in the **Amount** field is calculated automatically. These amounts have the opposite sign from the total amount in the **Amount** field in the recurring journal.
10. After entering the allocations lines, choose **OK** to return to the **Recurring General Journal** page. The **Allocated Amt. (USD)** field is filled in and matches the **Amount** field.
11. Post the journal.

## To change an allocation key that is already set up

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Recurring General Journals** page, select the journal with the allocation.
3. Choose the line with the allocation, and then choose the **Allocations** action.
4. Change the relevant fields, and then choose **OK**.

# Put Items Away with Inventory Put-aways

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

This article refers to method B in the table.

When your location is set up to require put-away processing but not receive processing, use an **Inventory Put-away** document to record and post put-away and receipt information for your source documents. Inbound source documents can be purchase orders, sales return orders, and inbound transfer orders.

> [!NOTE]
> Production and assembly output also represent inbound source documents. Learn more about handling production and assembly output for internal processes at [Design Details: Internal Warehouse Flows](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).

You can create an inventory put-away in three ways:  

* Create the inventory put-away directly from the source document itself.  
* Create inventory put-aways for several source documents at the same time by using a batch job.  
* Create the put-away in two steps by first by releasing the source document to make the items available to be put away. You can create the inventory put-away based on the source document by using the **Inventory Put-away** page.  

## To create an inventory put-away from the source document

1. In the source document, which can be a purchase order, sales return order, or inbound transfer order, choose the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action.  
2. Select the **Create Invt. Put-away** checkbox.
3. Choose the **OK** button. A new inventory put-away is created.

## To create multiple inventory put-aways with a batch job

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick/Movement**, and then choose the related link. 
2. On the **Warehouse Request** FastTab, use the **Source Document** and **Source No.** fields to filter on certain types of documents or ranges of document numbers. For example, you can create put-aways for purchase orders only.
3. On the **Options** FastTab, select the **Create Invt. Put-away** checkbox.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The specified inventory put-aways are created.

## To create the put-away in two steps

### To request an inventory put-away by releasing the source document

When you release purchase orders, sales return orders, and inbound transfer orders, the items on the orders become available to be put away. The following steps describe how to make the items on a purchase order ready to be put away.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the purchase order that you want to release, and then choose the **Release** action.  

### To create an inventory put-away based on the source document

A warehouse employee can create a new inventory put-away based on the released source document.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Put-away**, and then select the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Source Document** field, select the type of source document you are putting away for.  
4. In the **Source No.** field, select the source document.  
5. Alternatively, choose the **Get Source Document** action to select the document from a list of inbound source documents that are ready for put-away at the location.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill the put-away lines according to the selected source document.  

## To record the inventory put-away

1. On the **Inventory Put-aways** page, open a previously created put-away document.  
2. In the **Bin Code** field on the put-away lines, the bins where the items must be put away are suggested based on the items' default bin. You can change the bin if needed.  
3. Perform the put-away, and then enter the actual quantity that was put away in the **Qty. to Handle** field.

    If you must place the items for one line in more than one bin, for example because the designated bin is full, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.  
4. After you put the items away, choose the **Post** action.  

    * Post the receipt of the source document lines that have been put away
    * If the location uses bins, posting will also create warehouse entries to post the bin quantity changes.

# The Image Analyzer Extension

The Image Analyzer extension uses powerful image analytics provided by the Computer Vision API for Azure Cognitive Services to detect attributes in the images that you import for items and contact persons, so you can easily review and assign them. For items, attributes could be whether the item is a table or a car, and whether it is red or blue. For contact persons, attributes can be gender or age.

Image Analyzer suggests attributes based on tags that the Computer Vision API finds, and a confidence level. By default, it suggests attributes only if it is at least 80% sure that the attribute is correct. You can set another confidence level, if needed. To learn more about how the tags and confidence level are determined, see [Computer Vision API](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=851476).  

Image Analyzer is free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], but there is a limit to the number of items that you can analyze during a certain period of time. By default, you can analyze 100 images per month.

After you enable the extension, Image Analyzer runs each time you import an image to an item or contact person. You will see the attributes, confidence level, and details right away, and can decide what to do with each attribute. If you imported images before you enabled the Image Analyzer extension, you must go to the item or contact cards and choose the **Analyze Picture** action.  

## Privacy notice

## What is Sales Order Agent?

Sales Order Agent is an integrated AI agent that automates the task of handling requests for sales quotes and sales orders from customers. The agent can manage the entire sales order capturing process, from receiving a customer's order by email, locating the customer among the registered customers in Business Central, checking item availability, preparing a quote with the requested items, following up with the customer on any changes needed to finalize the quote, receiving quote approval, and converting it to a sales order.

Learn more in [Process sales quotes and orders with Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-process.md).

## What are the capabilities of Sales Order Agent?

The agent supports handling requests for sales quotes and sales orders from customers with the following capabilities:

- Agent configuration

  The agent is available directly within Business Central. You can configure and activate the agent to help your team or organization improve the sales process. For example, you can specify the users who can participate in the process of reviewing and approving the sales documents created by the agent. You can also specify the mailbox for receiving the customer requests and settings for searching your items and involving the users to review the agent's work.

  Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md).

- Task execution and interaction

  The agent operates based on its instructions and user configuration. The instructions describe its purpose, tasks, and high-level considerations for how to perform the flow. These instructions are defined in the agent code and aren't visible to users. The agent uses AI to identify and carry out the steps needed to complete its task within the Business Central environment. Learn more in [Sales Order Agent overview](sales-order-agent.md).

  The agent is invoked by a built-in email dispatcher that runs as a scheduled task and monitors the company mailbox specified in the agent's configuration. The dispatcher hands over emails received from the customers to Sales Order Agent and sends results of the agent's work, such as prepared sales quote with requested items, in response.
  
- Access and permissions

  The agent runs as its own user in Business Central and is granted access only to the necessary parts of the product. It comes with a predefined permission set and UI role (profile) that limits the parts of the product and UI elements (such as pages, fields, and actions) it can access.

- Transparency and change control

  The agent seeks user intervention in specific situations, such as preparing outbound communications or providing business review and approval for key operations.

  Business Central maintains full transparency and provides control over changes made by the agent. The agent brings humans in the loop when their attention is required by issuing in-product notifications that are displayed on the role center. For example, a notification occurs before any outbound email communications to a customer, when the agent needs more details to get unblocked, or when approval is needed for important changes.  

  For each task performed by the agent, users get a detailed timeline that shows the key steps taken by the agent and human users, including the email conversation. Users can review this information and update the values and actions the agent suggested if needed. Business Central can also display the reasoning used by the agent and citations that led to a suggested value.

## What is the intended use of Sales Order Agent?

Sales Order Agent is intended to handle the end-to-end sales order capturing process. This process includes:

- Taking the customer’s order by email.
- Iterating on the details with the customer via email.
- Checking the availability of the items.
- Preparing the sales quote with the requested items.
- Sending the quote to the customer for approval.
- Converting the quote to a sales order upon receiving customer confirmation.

## How was Sales Order Agent evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

We defined a set of categories and scenarios and created test cases for each as described in the following table. In total, we have a suite of 50 test cases.

|Category|Scenario|
|-|-|
|Quotes<br><br>Precise request for a quote with variations (delivery dates or not, terse/verbose request, complete or incomplete email signature) |<ul><li>Single/multi-turn with approval by customer. Up to three items.</li><li>Quote request for four or more items.</li><li>Request for quote by item reference. Up to three lines.</li><li>Quote sent but not approved by customer.</li><li>Quote request from unknown customer.</li><li>Quote request for unknown item.</li></ul>|
|Information<br><br>Requests for information about items followed by a quote request|<ul><li>Single and multi-turn with quote based on information.</li><li>Request for information about unknown items.</li></ul>|

## What are the limitations of Sales Order Agent? How can users minimize the impact of the Sales Order Agent limitations when using the system?

- Languages

  - [!INCLUDE[soa-language-support](includes/soa-language-support.md)]
  - Mixed language input might result in lower-quality output because the system relies on pure string similarity, and the semantic part of the matching might not work properly.

- Emailing

  - The agent reads inbound emails via a shared inbox on Microsoft Exchange. Learn more in [Set up email](admin-how-setup-email.md). Other ways to receive email aren't supported.
  - The agent only uses the email body to get the details of the request; it doesn't process files attached to emails.  
  - Large emails might exceed the number of tokens that can be processed in one request. This condition leads the agent to trigger a request for a human to investigate (similar to how a human is requested to approve whether the agent approves an email). 
  - Email messages generated by the agent might contain incorrect information. The agent is designed to ask a human to review and edit every outbound message if necessary.  

- Entities and data the agent can work with

  - The agent is designed to work with sales quotes and sales orders. It can't create or work with other sales documents (such as blank orders, invoices, or credit memos) or documents in other areas of the product (such as purchase or service orders).
  - The agent doesn't create new items, contacts, or customers. It only works with the entities that are already registered in Business Central. The agent is designed to ask a human user to provide additional information or perform the task manually, when it can't find this data in Business Central.
  - The agent doesn't post documents.
  - Based on more customer requests, the agent can make changes to the sales quotes, but not to the sales orders.
  - The agent is designed to work with sales lines of type "Item"; other sales line types, such as Resource, Charge (Item), Allocation Account, and Fixed Asset, aren't supported.
  - At this stage, the agent supports the creation of up to 15 item lines per sales document. Increasing the number of lines might result in lower-quality output.
  - How you name your products can affect agent output. For example, using cryptic abbreviations versus friendly names can reduce output quality.

- When adding items to a sales document, the use of the item's **Variant Code** isn't currently supported. It leaves the **Variant Code** field empty.

- Pricing and discount requests

   Business Central has an advanced price/discount calculation logic, often extended by ISV solutions. Therefore, the most reliable way to get the item price is to create a sales document—for example, a quote. For this reason, the agent is designed *not* to provide or update any pricing and discount information by email. Prices and default discounts are calculated by Business Central's own business logic and included with a sales quote document. Requests for changing discounts and pricing aren't accepted by the agent. Instead, they're surfaced to the users for applying them manually. 

- Other considerations

  - Delegated administrators can't activate the agent.  
  - It's only possible to configure and use one Sales Order Agent per Business Central company.
  - The agent uses the regional settings specified by its user account.
  - While the agent can recognize and interact with the custom fields and actions introduced by customizations and ISV solutions, which are added to the agent's profile and permissions, the results might vary in quality and should be thoroughly tested. Improving reliability of working with the custom elements might require adjustments to the agent's instructions, which is currently not supported. 
  
## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

- Access control and permissions

  Sales Order Agent can be granted access exclusively to specific parts of the product required to perform its designated tasks. The agent comes with predefined permissions and a user interface (UI) role, also known as a profile, that an administrator or configuring user can assign to the agent. This assignment restricts the agent's access to certain areas of the product. It defines the type of access (for example, whether the agent is only allowed to read specific data or also update or delete it) and determines which UI elements—such as pages, fields, actions, and FactBoxes—it can interact with.  

  We strongly encourage using the permission sets and the profile included with the Sales Order Agent, which can be assigned on the Agent card. This practice ensures that the agent only has access to the functionalities necessary for its role, enhancing both security and efficiency within the system.

  Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md).

- Transparency and notifications

  Business Central users can maintain full transparency and control over the changes made by Sales Order Agent by using other experiences that enable them to:

  - Receive notifications on the role center that come from the agent when it requires help or when the process demands human review. For example, review is required for all inbound and outbound messages, approvals, adding missing data, and similar reasons.
  - Get a better understanding of the specific task context and history (“timeline” view), including key steps involved in it.
  - Get a detailed review of each entity created by the agent (for example, a sales quote or sales order that surfaces all changes and suggestions made by the agent within a specific task. This behavior allows humans to review and adjust changes, and then sign out on proceeding with the task.
  - Get an overview of the agent's key performance indicators (KPIs) that summarize the impact of the agent's work. For example, you can get an overview of the number of sales quotes or orders created by the agent and the total number of these orders.

    Make sure you attend to the notifications raised by the agent to review and approve its work.  
- All actions done by the agent, including creating and modifying records and calling actions, carry the agent's user ID. This user ID appears in the same places and in the same way as it does with other users, such as in list views, history, posted documents, notifications, and more.  
- Approval workflows can be used to add an extra layer of control to the tasks done by the agent, as they do with other users. You can set up approval workflows to make the agent create a request for approval for a specific change—for example, to mark the quote as released. The change isn't allowed until another user approves the request. Learn more in [Use Approval Workflows](across-how-use-approval-workflows.md).

## Is this capability extensible?

Currently, this capability isn't extensible by partners.

# Summarize records with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Use Copilot to get a quick summary of a record, such as a customer, item, or sales order, directly in the page's FactBox pane. Copilot uses AI to generate two or three concise bullet points that provide details and insights about the data tailored to your role in Business Central. The summary helps you understand the data and identify areas that need attention. Interact with the summary to link to data sources and open related pages, so you can act on your data.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## How Copilot summarizes your data

Copilot uses fields from the record, information from FactBoxes, and fields from related statistics pages to create a summary. It works on your behalf and can only access data that you can access in Business Central. For example, if you personalize the page to hide a field, Copilot doesn't include that field in the summary. If security controls remove access to specific fields, Copilot doesn't include those fields in summaries.

## Prerequisites

The **Summarize** capability is active, and you have the required permissions to use it. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Availability

This feature is available on most card and document pages, like a **Customer card** or a **Sales Order**. If it's not available on a page as expected, it might be hidden. [Learn how to show or hide the summary](#show-or-hide-the-summary).

## Summarize a record

1. Open the record.
1. In the **Summary** part at the top of the FactBox pane on the right side, select the ![Shows the down arrow head icon to expand the FactBox pane.](media/down-arrow-head.png) **Expand summary** icon to generate the summary.

   ![Shows the Summary part in the FactBox pane.](media/summary-with-copilot-collapsed.svg "Shows the Summary part in the FactBox pane.")

   > [!TIP]
   > If the **Summary** part is expanded when the page opens, Copilot generates the summary immediately without your interaction. If the **Summary** is expanded when you close the page, Copilot automatically generates the summary the next time you open the page for a record.

1. The summary appears in a moment for you to review and interact with.

   ![Shows the Summary part opened in the FactBox pane.](media/summary-with-copilot-opened.svg "Shows the Summary part opened in the FactBox pane.")

   Review the summary before making any decisions. The content is AI-generated and might be incorrect or inaccurate.

   - Explore the data

     Summaries are based on data from the record, FactBoxes that display related information, and related pages that show aggregated information like statistics pages. Some summary text is linked, so you can go to the data source. Select the links to view details or take action based on the summarized data.

   - Get more insights

     Select the **Show more** button to get more information about the record. The Copilot pane opens on the right side and generates more points of interest.

   - Regenerate the summary

     Select the **Regenerate summary** icon to generate a new summary, updated with changes to the record and related data. The same summary appears for a few minutes before a new one is automatically generated, but you can request a summary from the latest data at any time.

## Share the summary  

You can easily share any summary with your coworkers by using the **Copy summary** button, then pasting into your favorite app such as Microsoft Teams chats, Outlook emails, or in your project OneNote. Pasting a summary includes the summary bullet points and a link to the source page in Business Central that you can navigate to the full information.

- To copy the summary from the FactBox, select <kbd>...</kbd> **Show more options for FactBox pane** > **Summary** at the bottom of the FactBox, and then select **Copy summary**. The summary is now copied to your clipboard. You can also select or set focus to the FactBox using your keyboard and use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> shortcut, then switch apps and use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> shortcut to paste.

- To copy the summary from the Copilot pane, hover over the summary message and select **Copy**. The summary is now copied to your clipboard. You can also select or set focus to the summary message and use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> shortcut, then switch apps and use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> shortcut to paste.

> [!NOTE]
> Summaries are intended for use within your organization and might contain sensitive information. Review the summary carefully before sharing outside of your organization.

## Show or hide the summary

Business Central remembers if you collapsed, expanded, or hid the **Summary** the last time you had the page open.

- To show the **Summary** part, select <kbd>...</kbd> **Show more options for FactBox pane** > **Summary** at the top of the FactBox pane.
- To hide the **Summary** part, select <kbd>...</kbd> **Show more options for FactBox pane** > **Summary** at the top of the **Summary** part.
- Because the **Summary** part is in the FactBox pane, it's hidden if the FactBox pane is collapsed. To show the FactBox pane, select the ![Shows the icon to expand the FactBox pane.](media/expand-factbox-icon.png) **Expand FactBox pane** icon.

# Teams FAQ

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

This article answers some of the questions you might have about working with Microsoft Teams and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## [General](#tab/general)

### How do I sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams?

After installing the app, you'll be asked to sign in the first time you use it, when you paste a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] link into Teams chat, or choose the **Details** action on a card in Teams. Depending on your Teams client, you might have to enter the credentials you use to access [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### How do I sign out of the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams?

To sign out of the identity in Teams you used to connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], go to any chat compose box, right-click the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] icon underneath, then choose **Settings**. When the window appears, check your currently signed in identity and then choose **Sign out**.

### Does the app for Teams connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises? 

No. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams only works with [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] online. There are no plans to support [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] deployment types&mdash;such as on-premises, hybrid cloud, or private cloud&mdash;that Microsoft doesn't host or manage directly.

### Does the app work with multiple companies and environments? 

Yes. To search for contacts in a different company, go to [Settings](across-teams-settings.md). When the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app expands a link into a card, the link must contain the environment and company names for the app to match the record to the right company. You can paste links to any companies and environments you have access to within your organization and from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] account you used to sign in. Participants in the chat will see the card. But they can't view the card details unless they have permissions to the company or environment where that record is stored.

### In which countries or regions is the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app available? 

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams isn't restricted by country or region. The app is available in all markets currently supported by the Teams marketplace.

### Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app work with any localization of [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]? 

Yes. The app works with any localization of [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], whether offered by Microsoft or a partner.  Learn more at [Country/regional availability and supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json).

### <a name="language"></a>Which languages does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app support?

Two things determine the language used for cards and card details in Teams:

1. Your language in Teams, which you can see from your account settings in Teams. 
2. Your language in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], which you can see in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] Web client (learn more in [Change Basic Setting - Language](ui-change-basic-settings.md#language)).

The following table explains how the experience differs for message authors and recipients, depending on language settings and availability of languages.

|Who|Card|Card details |
|-|----|--------------| 
|Message author |Displays in the language that's specified for you in Teams. If [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't offer that same language, the card is displayed in English. |Displayed in the language that's specified for you in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], which might include languages from language apps provided by partners. |
|Message recipient |Displays in the language of the message author. |Displays in the language that's specified for you in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. |

Get a list of supported languages for [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] in [Supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json#supported-languages).

### Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app work with industry solutions?

Yes. But only some features of the app work with Embed apps:

- The app works with links based on the **\*.bc.dynamics.com** pattern that's typically used with Embed apps.
- Contact search isn't available for Embed apps that replace the base application from Microsoft.

Learn more about emdeb apps in [Embed apps](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/embed-app-overview).

### Does [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] work with the Teams mobile app?

Yes. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app can be installed from the Teams desktop app or browser, or by an administrator for all users. Once installed, the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app is automatically available in Teams for iOS and Android. On mobile devices, you can only view cards sent by others, access details, or pop out the card to the full experience in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app. You can't paste links that expand into cards when composing messages or searching for contacts. Learn more about minimum requirements for mobile in [Minimum Requirements for Using Business Central](product-requirements.md).

### Is the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams the same as the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for iOS and Android?

No. The app for Teams is an add-in to Microsoft Teams and exclusively designed for collaboration within Teams. Alternatively, the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app delivers a rich experience for you to work with [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] data on your mobile devices.

Mobile users are encouraged to install both the mobile app and the app for Teams to get the most out of [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. With both installed, you can choose the **Pop out** action on a card in Teams to open the card details in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app. Learn more about installing the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] and Teams mobile apps in:

- [Get Business Central on Your Mobile Device](install-mobile-app.md)
- [Get the Teams Mobile App](https://support.microsoft.com/office/download-the-mobile-app-for-teams-5940ebdc-0082-4fb1-83c4-751edc23dcb5) in Microsoft Support

### Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app work in all Teams clients?

No. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams isn't supported when installed as a package for macOS or Linux. On those platforms, use a supported browser to access Teams.

Learn more about minimum requirements in [Minimum Requirements for Using Business Central](product-requirements.md#teams).

Learn more about the choice of Teams clients and how to install them at [Get clients for Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/get-clients) in the Teams documentation.

### Which Teams client is best for [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]?

There are only minor differences and limitations between Teams clients that might affect your experience with the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams. When choosing a Teams client, consider:

- The camera and location can't be accessed from the details window in the Teams desktop app.
- Phone numbers can't be activated from the details window in Teams for iOS, Android, or in the browser.
- Using Microsoft Edge with Teams in the browser lets you easily work across multiple identities and accounts by signing in to Teams from different profiles. Learn more about using profiles in Microsoft Edge at [Sign in and create multiple profiles in Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/office/sign-in-and-create-multiple-profiles-in-microsoft-edge-df94e622-2061-49ae-ad1d-6f0e43ce6435) in Microsoft Support.

### What is the best way for me to demonstrate [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] and Microsoft Teams to prospective customers?

If you're a reselling partner, you might want to have an environment that you can show prospects as part of pre-sales demonstrations. To avoid affecting Microsoft Teams in your organization, you can get a Microsoft 365 demo account at [https://aka.ms/CDX](https://aka.ms/CDX). This account gives you full control of an independent Azure organization that includes Microsoft Teams and [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Preparing Demonstration Environments of Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/demo-environment).

### Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams cater to my customization and personalization?

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams can display cards for links to customer pages and tables in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], such as those pages and tables from your own custom extensions or AppSource.

The fields shown on a card in Teams can also be affected by [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] customizations installed for your organization. Cards don't consider any role-specific customizations or user personalization. However, the card details window shows record details as you would see them in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], including extensions, role customizations, and user personalization.

When you search for contacts, the fields matched in the **Contacts** table and fields shown in the search results aren't affected by any customization or personalization.

### How do the permissions required by the app affect my privacy?

Before installing the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, you can review the minimum permissions required for the app to function. By installing the app, you give the app permission to receive the messages and data you provide to it and you give Teams permission to store and process those messages.

Also, some [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] features require opening external links or access to your camera or geographic location. So suppose you wanted to capture a photo of a purchase invoice for processing. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app doesn't use these capabilities without your consent and they're only used by specific features in the **Details** window. When you use one of these features for the first time, Teams displays a dialog box asking you to grant access to the required device capabilities.

- In Teams desktop, you review and adjust app permissions from the **Settings** window. Select your profile picture at the top of the app, select **Settings** > **Permissions**, then select the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app.

- For Teams in the browser and Teams for iOS or Android, you can review or adjust permissions from your browser or device settings.

> [!NOTE]
> Exactly which [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] features prompt you for permissions depends on the add-on apps and customizations applied to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] environment you connect to.

### Where can I learn about my privacy? 

You can learn about how Microsoft handles your data in the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2030602). 

Contact your administrator to learn how your organization handles the privacy of your data.

### How do I uninstall the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams?

To remove the app that you installed for yourself, go to any chat compose box, find the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] icon underneath, right-click the icon, and select **Uninstall**.  

### Will Microsoft continue to improve the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams?

At Microsoft, we're constantly listening to feedback from our diverse user community and acting upon the top suggestions. To learn about what's next for the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, see the [Dynamics 365 release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/).

If you want to participate in improving the app for Teams, or have an idea that would help simplify your work or collaborative experiences in Teams, add an idea or vote for existing ideas at [https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas](https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas).

### Where can I find Teams integration inside the Business Central web client? 

To learn about the functionality in the web client that links to Teams, see [Share Records and Page Links in Microsoft Teams](across-working-with-teams.md#share-link).

2. Either a Business Central license or has been granted access to Business Central using their Microsoft 365 license.
3. Permissions to view the data on the page.

### <a name=#recommended-content></a>Where does the recommended content come from?

The recommended content that you can choose from in the **Tab content** option on a tab is based on your Role Center. The recommend content only includes list pages, like Customers, Sales Orders, and Vendors - not individuals card page alike a specific customer or vendor.

Specifically, the recommended content includes:

- Actions in the top navigation menu of the role center
- Any list pages you've bookmarked.
- If a list page offers different views, including any views you created, you also get to choose from those views

You can add list pages to the recommended content by adding bookmarks. You can also remove recommended content by deleting bookmarks. Learn more in [Bookmark a Page or Report on Your Role Center](ui-bookmarks.md).

If you switch the environment or company on the tab option, the recommended content will changed based on the Role Center and bookmarks for the environment and company you switch to.

### When I create a tab, does it grant permissions to the people in the channel or chat?

No. Creating tabs doesn't affect permissions, and users must already have permission to that data when they access the tab.

### Can I chat alongside a tab?

Yes. Use the chat icon to start the conversation. This chat thread is then associated with the tab. 

### If I remove a tab from a chat or channel, is any Business Central data deleted?

No.

### Can I safely rename a tab?

Yes. The contents of the tab are unrelated to the actual name of the tab. Rename at will! 

### I need to work across tasks in different windows. Can I do this?

Yes. You can pop out the tab to its own browser window to show the Business Central web client. 

### Can I add or pin tab in Team meetings?

No. The Business Central app for Teams doesn't support tabs in meetings.

### Can't add a tab if using ISV Urls like *.bc.dynamics.com (but can pin)

Not supported.

### When I do things in the tab, like navigate, resort, apply a filter, or search, do others see my changes?

No. Only field changes or running actions affect how others see the contents of the tab.

### Does the tab content refresh automatically? If not, how do I refresh it?

The content doesn't refresh automatically, and these currently no refresh button. The best way to refresh the content to make sure it's up to data, leave the tab and then come back. 

### Does this show lists and records from my customizations and add-ons?

Yes. 

### When I add a tab, will people see it in my language?

No. Each user views the tab contents in the language, region, and timezone settings from Business Central. 

### Can I have multiple tabs pointing to different content?

Yes.

### Can I also add tabs to chat with a single person?

Yes, as long as the chat isn't a draft (that is, a message hasn't been sent to initiate that chat) and the other person has the Business Central app installed too.

### Can I switch companies within a tab?

No.

### Is this different than using Teams' generic ability to create a tab that hosts a website?

Yes. We don't recommend that you use approach. In many cases, it doesn't work for Business Central.

## [Search for Contacts](#tab/contacts)

### Which tables does the app search in?

When searching for contacts from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, your search terms are matched against records in the **Contacts** table in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. 

### Which fields in the contacts table can I search?

As you type your search terms in the search box, the terms are matched against most fields in the **Contacts** table. The fields include, for example, the **No.**, **Name**, **Address**, **Phone No.** or **Mobile Phone No.**, and **Email** fields. 

Search terms aren't matched against any custom fields added to the **Contacts** table by apps and extensions.

### Do search results include companies and persons?

Yes. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], contacts can be of type **Company** or type **Person**, where one or more persons can be associated with a company. In the search results, companies and persons have different icons.

### Do contacts of any business relationship appear in the results?

Yes. Some contacts can represent customers or vendors, or both. Other contacts with no defined business relation typically represent prospective customers. Contacts with other business relations, including any custom relations you've configured in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], will also be displayed in the search results.

### Can I look up contact details during meetings?

Yes. You can look up contact information, history of interaction, and related documents for your customer or vendor during a Teams meeting or call while the meeting is happening, without leaving Teams.

In fact, you can look up contact details from anywhere in Teams by using the **Search** box. You can, for example, look up contact details from the Teams calendar to help you set up meetings.

### How do I view my last interactions with a contact?

The details window for a contact displays interaction log entries. The interaction log entries provide the history of interactions that your organization has had with the specific contact. The interactions can include emails you've exchanged, calls you've received, or documents you've sent.

For interactions to be displayed, [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] must be configured to track interactions. To learn more about logging interactions, see [Record Interactions With Contacts](marketing-interactions.md).

### How do I register a Teams call or meeting as an interaction?

From the details window for a contact, find the **Create Interaction** action, and choose from the incoming or outgoing calls as interaction templates. You can also create your own custom interaction templates specifically for use with Teams conversations.

### Can I call a contact from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams?

[!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] has limited integration to Teams calling capabilities. It isn't possible to instantly start a VOIP call from the contact card or contact details window. However, when you view the contact details in the Teams desktop app, you can select the phone number field to dial that number if Teams is set up as your default dialing app on your device. To dial landlines or mobile phone numbers using PSTN, the traditional phone system, Teams requires that you have the Microsoft 365 Business Voice app. To learn more, see [What is Microsoft 365 Business Voice?](/MicrosoftTeams/business-voice/whats-business-voice).

### How do I view recent documents for a customer or vendor?

[!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] typically relates a contact with a customer or vendor record that in turn is related to business transaction records, such as sales quotes or purchase invoices. To view related documents for a contact, go to the details window for the contact, select the **Business Relation** field value or use the actions to navigate to the associated customer or vendor. On the customer or vendor page, expand the FactBox pane to reveal statistics for various documents that you can drill down into. Your experience can differ based on your customizations and personalization.

### How do I search for contacts using special characters?

You can enter search criteria using almost any unicode characters. However, [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] reserves the following symbols for other uses: **=**, **.**, **\***, and **@**. Using these symbols in your search terms might not return the expected results. If you don't see the expected results, enclose the symbols in your search terms in single quotes, for example, **Contoso'='2**.

### How can I search contacts stored in a different company?

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams can search for customers, vendors, and other contacts in one company at a time.  
To search for contacts stored in a different [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] company, open [Settings](across-teams-settings.md), then change the environment and company from there.

### Are [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts different than the ones in the Teams contacts screen?

Yes. Contacts stored in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] represent business contacts available to your organization. They're contacts with which you have an established and well-defined business relationship, or contacts that represent prospective customers. These contacts are typically external contacts. In comparison, the contacts shown in the Teams Calling contacts list are your own contacts. These contacts aren't necessarily shared with others in your organization, and they typically represent contacts internal to your organization.

### Does [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] synchronize contacts with Teams?

No. Contacts stored in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] remain separate from your contacts stored in Teams. There are currently no plans to synchronize the two lists together. When you use the Teams feature **Share someone's contact info** from the chat compose box, it has no relation to Business Central contacts.

### Can I search from my mobile device?

Contact search isn't available from Teams for iOS and Teams for Android at this time.

### Which permissions do I need for contact search?

To search for contacts, you need object-level permission to the **Contacts** table within the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] company being searched. To view the details window for a contact, you need at least read permission to the **Contact** page within the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] company, and any other related objects.

### Can I use contact search if I'm a delegated admin?

Yes. You can also look up contacts and contact details if you have a delegated admin role in an organization.

### Is contact search affected by API limits?

Yes. Searching for contacts from Teams is based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] v2.0 APIs and subject to any API limits that manage usage. Learn more about the limits in [Current API Limits](/dynamics-nav/api-reference/v2.0/dynamics-current-limits).

### Why does it sometimes ask me to set up the app?

After you sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams for the first time, the app will attempt to determine your preferred company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. If the app can't determine the company, you might have to go to the **Settings** and choose the company you wish to search in. This situation happens, for example, if you have access to multiple companies across environments in your organization. In this case, you'll have to choose a company before you can start searching.  

The app can also ask you to visit the **Settings** if you don't have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] subscription, there are no [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] environments, or your account doesn't have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] license.

### I'd like to search for items or records from other tables. Can I do this from Teams?

Searching in other tables isn't possible at this time. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams searches only in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts list, which can include vendors, customers, and other contacts.

If you'd like to see the search capabilities evolve to include other tables, we encourage our community to add an idea or vote for existing ideas at https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas.

## [Work with cards](#tab/cards)

### Which types of links does the app support?

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams reacts to most [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] Web client links. When the link refers to a single record on a page, the card will display fields for that record. The supported page types include: 

- Card pages, such as the Item card
- Document pages, such as the Sales Order document
- ListPlus pages that represent a single record composed of other records, such as a Bank Account Reconciliation statement
- Simple list pages where a record doesn't offer the ability to drill down into a separate details page, such as the Zip codes list

When pasting a link to the root Web client Url, such as https://businesscentral.dynamics.com, the card instead displays information to help new users get started with accessing [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### How do I delete a card I sent to a chat?

You can't delete a card that you've already sent to chat. But you can delete the entire message that the card is a part of.

As the message author, you can delete any messages you sent to chats with a person, group, or channel&mdash;unless your administrator has set up policies that prevent deleting messages. If you moderate a channel as a channel owner, your administrator might have also granted you permission to delete any messages in the channel, including those messages sent by other users.

Deleting a message that contains a card doesn't delete or affect any data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Do cards always show up-to-date information?

No. The field values on a card in Teams, including any images, are based on the data available when that card was sent to the chat. [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] cards don't automatically refresh in Teams. 

### Why don't cards show more information instead of just the page name and details button?

An administrator might have configured the Teams integration so that cards don't show data about records. For more information, see [Show or hide record data on cards](admin-teams-integration.md#show-or-hide-record-data-on-cards).

### Will others see my card if they don't have the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams? 

When you compose and send a message to chat that includes a card, all users will see the card&mdash;even if they haven't installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams.

### How do I find out which company a card in Teams belongs to?

If you work across [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] companies, talk to your administrator about enabling a company badge for each company. When enabled, this eye-catching hint appears in any details window inside Teams, and displays the company and environment that record belongs to. To learn how to set up company badge, see [Display a company badge](admin-company-information.md#badge).

## [Work with card details](#tab/carddetails)

### Where is the save button in the details window in Teams?

[!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically saves changes you make to any field as soon as you leave the field. To leave a field, click/tap anywhere outside the field or use the Tab key to move to the next field. When data appears in a dialog within the details window, you might need to choose the **OK** button to have [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] save your changes.

### If I choose to view details for a card, will other users see my details window?

No. While everyone in the chat or meeting can view the card itself, the details window only appears for you on your device when you choose **Details**. Other users must choose **Details** if they would like to view the details window on their device.

### Can I start a Teams call from the details window in Teams?

Yes. If you're using the Teams desktop app, start a call by choosing the linked number in a phone number field, like the **Mobile Phone No.** field on the **Contact** card. Teams must be your designated dialing app.

To call local or international landlines and mobile phones, Teams requires that you have a Business Voice license for enterprise calling. Also, you must set up Teams as your call solution. To learn more, see [Plan your Teams voice solution](/microsoftteams/cloud-voice-landing-page) in the Teams documentation.

### Can I print documents from the details window in Teams?

Yes. You print reports and other documents using standard [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] printing functionality and any cloud-enabled printer configured in the **Printer Management** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can't print from Teams to local printers known to your client device, such as printers that you'd typically print to from your browser. For this reason, you can't print from the report preview window, but only from the main report request page, directly to your cloud printers.

For more information about setting up cloud printers, see [Set Up Printers](ui-specify-printer-selection-reports.md).

### Can I access the camera from the details window in Teams?

Yes. Any [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] features in the details window that use the camera are available on all Teams clients.

### <a name="location"></a>Can I access my location from the details window in Teams?

If you're using functionality in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] that accesses your current location coordinates, such as with maps, you must use Teams in the browser or the Teams mobile app. Location isn't available when using the Teams desktop app.

### How do I open the details in a new window?

Popping out the details window as a separate window is useful for multi-tasking or for being able to work with business data while still being able to use Teams chat and other Teams functions. To open details in its own window, choose **Open in browser** from the ellipse menu (**...**) in the upper right corner of the window.

## [Collaborate with guests](#tab/collaborating)

### Can I share cards with users outside my organization?

Yes. When you compose and send a message that includes a card, all recipients in the chat will see the card&mdash;even if they're guests or external to your organization. Guests can also open the details window if they've been granted permissions to access that data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Is the experience any different for users that are guests?

Yes. Inviting guest users from outside your organization to participate in chat or a channel gives them a similar, but not identical experience compared to users within your organization. When a guest receives a message that includes a card, they can view it. Guests can also open the details page if they have permission to access that data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] and assigned a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] license within your organization.

Choosing the details link on any Business Central card will sign you in to the environment from which the card was shared, assuming you have permission to the environment.

Guest users aren't allowed to use contact search because it's bound to the original tenant and we don't currently support such a delegated scenario.

When a guest composes a message, links to their [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] or yours won't expand into cards.

To learn about other similarities and differences between guests and team members, go to [Guest experience in Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/guest-experience) in the Teams documentation.

### How does a guest user install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app? 

Guests don't have access to the app marketplace to install apps themselves. However, the app can be automatically installed for them based on your organization's policies. Another way for a guest user to install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app is when they receive a chat message that includes a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] card. In this case, the user chooses the **Details** button or the menu on the card, then installs the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for use with your organization. After installing the app, a user doesn't automatically receive any permissions to access data from your [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

## [Share to Teams](#tab/share)

### Does Share to Teams send a compact card? 

Yes. The link will automatically expand into a card if you have the Business Central app for Teams installed. 

### Will recipients receive the message from me or from a Business Central service account? 

When you use Share to Teams, the message is sent to a person, group, or channel, similar to if you had sent the message yourself from within Microsoft Teams. Recipients see the message from you on their preferred Teams client, and can react and respond as they normally would to a message from you. 

### Is Share to Teams available in Business Central on premises? 

No. Similar to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, this feature is only available for the web client in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] online. There are no plans to support [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] deployment types&mdash;like on-premises, hybrid cloud, or private cloud&mdash;that Microsoft doesn't host or manage directly.

### Does Share to Teams grant permissions to recipients? 

No. When you share with a person, group, or channel, permissions are unaffected. Users who already have permission to view the page and data targeted by the link can do so. Users who don't have permission to view that page and data, or don't have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] license, are shown an error message. 
 
### Must I have the Teams desktop app installed to use Share to Teams? 

No. All you need is a valid account that has access to Microsoft Teams. 

### Is Share to Teams available in all Business Central clients? 

At this time, Share to Teams is available in the desktop web client, in the details window in Teams, and when opening a page in a new window from the Outlook add-in.

### Where do I find Share to Teams in Business Central? 

The **Share to Teams action** can be found in the **Share** menu on all pages, such as card and document pages, list or worksheet pages, including custom pages. The action isn't available on dialog boxes or pages shown as dialog boxes, such as lookup pages or wizards.

   The measure defines variables for the **Production Order Number**, **Production Order Line Number**, **Item Number**, and **Production Order Status** from the **Production Order Lines** table.

2. **Inventory Adjustment Lines**:
   It then creates a table of relevant inventory adjustment lines that correspond to the current production order line, with the condition that the **iSFinished** status is set to **TRUE** if the production order status is **Finished**.

3. **Inventory Adjustment Details**:
   The measure selects the order number, item number, and order line number from the inventory adjustment lines.

4. **Capacity Ledger Entries**:
   It then filters the **Capacity Ledger Entries** table to match the **Order No.**, **Order Line No.**, and **Item No.** from the inventory adjustments and ensures **Subcontracting** is excluded.

5. **Return the Actual Capacity Cost**:
   Finally, the measure calculates the sum of **directCost** from the **Capacity Ledger Entries** table, dividing it by the **ShareOfCapCost** measure to account for the specific share of capacity costs.

   The measure multiplies the sum of the following by the **IndirectCost** percentage (converted from percent to decimal), and then adds the product of **OutputQty** and **OverheadRate**.

   - [Actual Material Cost](#actual-material-cost)
   - [Actual Capacity Cost](#actual-capacity-cost)

   - ProdOrderNo
   - ProdOrderLineNo
   - ProdOrderItem
   - ProdOrderStatus

2. **Inventory Adjustment Matching**:
   It retrieves matching rows from **Inventory Adjustment Entry Order Line**, where:

   - THe order number, line number, and item match the production order line variables.
   - The **iSFinished** flag corresponds to whether the production order is marked as **Finished**.

3. **Subcontracted Capacity Ledger Entries**:
   It then filters the **Capacity Ledger Entries** table to:

   - Match the order number, order line number, and item number from the inventory adjustment.
   - Include only entries where **Subcontracting** is **TRUE**.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   It calculates the total **directCost** from these filtered subcontracted capacity ledger entries and divides it by the **ShareOfCapCost** measure.

5. **Aggregation**:
   `SUMX` iterates this logic over all production order lines, returning the total actual subcontracted cost.

   Retrieves the appropriate time factor from the **Time Factors** table based on the capacity unit defined in the **Manufacturing Setup**.

2. **Quantity Calculation** (`Qty` variable):
   Iterates over filtered *Capacity Ledger Entries* (excluding subcontracting), and for each row:

   - Determines the **Qty Per Capacity Unit of Measure** (defaulting to 1 if zero).
   - Looks up the appropriate **Time Factor**:

     - If the **Qty Per Capacity Unit of Measure** is zero, it uses the time factor based on the work center’s unit of measure. Otherwise, it uses the time factor based on the entry's own capacity unit.
     - Computes the adjusted quantity as `quantity / QtyPerCapUnitOfMeasure * TimeFactor`.

3. **Final Conversion**:

# Multiple Contracts
Depending on your service level agreements with a customer, you may have to handle a service item under more than one service contract.  
  
By handling a service item under multiple contracts, you can do the following:  
  
* Issue different contracts for the same service item.  
* Service parts separately.  
* Consider different skills that are required to service different aspects of a service item, such as mechanical components and software.  
* Specify different response times and frequencies in servicing different parts of a service item.  
* Address different kinds of activities to be performed on a service item when the service item requires different types of service in different time periods.  
* Select and assign an appropriate contract number to a service item line when you are creating a service order.  
* Handle relevant financial information about service items and service level agreements.  
  
You can consider the following examples of using the multiple contracts functionality.  
  
## Creating Multiple Contracts per Service Item  
You can manually create a service contract or contract quote for service items already registered in non-canceled contracts owned by the same customer. To do this, follow the standard procedure of creating service contracts and service contract quotes. For more information, see [Work with Service Contracts and Service Contract Quotes](service-how-to-create-service-contracts-and-service-contract-quotes.md).  
  
When you add a service item on a contract line that is registered in other service contracts or contract quotes, a warning message is displayed stating that the service item already belongs to one or more service contracts or contract quotes. If you confirm this message, all relevant service item information is copied to a newly created contract line.  
  
## Copying Documents  
You can automatically create a service contract or contract quote for service items that are already registered in other service contracts or contract quotes by using the **Copy from Document** action.  
  
## Creating Service Orders for Multiple Contracts  
You can manually create a service order for a service item that is registered in multiple active contracts. A service contract is active when it is signed and not expired.

# Set up item tracking with serial, lot, and package numbers

Keep track of inventory items, even in complex warehouse configurations, by assigning numbers that are specific to each item. You can use numbers for individual objects, lots, or packages. With item tracking, you can trace items across internal warehouse movements, and outbound and inbound documents.

Items with serial and lot numbers can be traced both backwards and forward in the supply chain. Tracing is useful for general quality assurance and for product recalls. For more information, see [Trace Item-Tracked Items](inventory-how-to-trace-item-tracked-items.md).  

## Numbers and item tracking

As part of your warehouse processes, you can bundle your stock in packages, boxes, containers, and so on. But in order to keep track of the items, you assign unique numbers as identification. For example, you manufacture and sell a chair that has the item number *1900-S*. Each chair has a serial number, *1001*, but you also bundle four chairs into a lot, *LOT0001*. You also ship the chairs in a container with the package number *CONTAINER010* that also includes *LOT0100* with side tables, and *LOT200* with lamps.  

Depending on your configuration, you use these different numbers to keep track of inventory in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] at the various stages of purchasing, sales, warehouse operations, and so on.

## To set up item tracking codes

An item tracking code reflects the different considerations a company has regarding the use of serial and lot numbers for items moving through the inventory.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracking Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. On the **Serial No.**, **Lot No.**, and the **Package Tracking** FastTabs, define policies of item tracking by serial, lot, and package numbers respectively.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want to track specific items or specific lots throughout their lifetime, you must choose the **SN Specific Tracking**, **Lot Specific Tracking**, and **Package Specific Tracking** fields, respectively. As a result, when you handle an outbound unit of an item with this item tracking code, you must always specify which serial number or lot number to handle. This means that when you sell a unit of the item, it must be applied against a specific pool of serial numbers or lot numbers. In other words, the serial, lot, or package number assigned to the item when it enters inventory must follow the item when it leaves inventory.

Because these setup fields cover all possible transactions with the item, the individual inbound/outbound fields are selected. However, the individual inbound/outbound fields have nothing to do with application across inventory. They merely define your company's work flow concerning when to assign item tracking numbers.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To assign item tracking numbers in warehouse activities, the **SN Warehouse Tracking** and **Lot Warehouse Tracking** fields must be selected on the item's item tracking code card.  

## To set up expiration rules for serial or lot numbers

For some items, you might want to set up specific expiration dates and rules in the item tracking code. This functionality allows you to keep track of when specific serial numbers and lot numbers expire.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracking Codes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select an existing item tracking code, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. On the **Misc.** FastTab, select the following fields:  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Strict Expiration Posting**|Specifies that the expiration date for the item tracking number when it entered inventory is respected when it exits inventory.|  
    |**Require Expiration Date Entry**|Specifies that you must enter an expiration date on the item tracking line.|  
    |**Use Expiration Dates**|Specifies that you want to calculate expiration dates. |  

## To set up warranties for serial or lot numbers

For some items, you might want to set up specific warranties in the item tracking code. This functionality allows you to keep track of when the warranties on specific serial or lot numbers in your inventory expire.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracking Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select an existing item tracking code, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. On the **Misc.** FastTab, fill in the **Warranty Date Formula** field, and then select the fields as follows:  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Warranty Date Formula**|Specifies the last day of warranty for the item.|  
    |**Require Warranty Date Entry**|Specifies that you must manually enter a warranty date on the item tracking line.|  

## To set up items for tracking with the correct item tracking codes

To enable item tracking, you first have to assign the item tracking codes to an item. There are two ways to add item tracking codes, by selecting the code from a predefined list or by assigning a new unique code. Hover over the fields to read a short description.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select an existing item from the list, and open the **Item Card** page.  
3. On the **Item Tracking** FastTab, assign the appropriate item tracking codes and choose the **Item Tracking Code**, the **Serial Nos.**, and the **Lot Nos.**.
    1. Alternatively you can also create a new item tracking code by selecting the **New** action.

## To specify opening balances for the items, you track

You can create opening balances for the items you track. Because you can choose different warehouse configurations, there are two options:

* Enable specific batches on the **Item Journal** page to let people enter serial, lot, and package data directly on journal lines.
* For locations where the **Directed Put-away and Pick** toggle is turned on, use the **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal** page to make all item tracking fields available. The fields that are available include the **Warranty Date** and **Expiration Date** fields.

### Item journals

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. To open a list of item journal batches, choose the **Name** field.
3. Choose **New** to create a new batch, and then turn on the **Item Tracking on Lines** toggle.
4. Choose **OK** to select the batch you created.
5. Fill in the fields on the item journal line as necessary. The **Lot No.**, **Serial No.**, **Expiration Date**, **Warranty Date**, and **Package No.** fields are available if you enabled item tracking.
    1. Alternatively choose the **Edit in Excel** action. Using Excel lets you quickly fill in columns, including **Serial No.**, **Lot No.**, **Package No.**, **Expiration Date**, and **Warranty Date**. When you're done, choose **Publish** to send changes to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
6. Choose the **Post** action to adjust inventory.

> [!NOTE] 
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does a few minor validations when you enter or import data. A more comprehensive check happens when you post or transfer data from journal lines to the **Item Tracking** page. The latter happens automatically when you open the **Item Tracking** page from the item journal line or if you choose the **Update Item Tracking Lines** action.

### Warehouse physical inventory journal for locations where directed pick and put-away is turned on  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields on the item journal line as necessary. The **Lot No.**, **Serial No.**, **Expiration Date**, **Warranty Date**, and **Package No.** fields are available if you enabled item tracking.
3. Choose the **Register** action to make the inventory adjustments. Remember to synchronize the adjusted warehouse entries with the related item ledger entries. To learn more, go to [synchronize the adjusted warehouse entries](/dynamics365/business-central/inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify#to-synchronize-the-adjusted-warehouse-entries-with-the-related-item-ledger-entries).

For bulk imports, use configuration packages to import data to the journals.

# The Payments and Reconciliations (DK) Extension

Make fast, error-free payments by exporting files that are formatted specifically for exchanges with your vendor or bank. These files speed up the payment and reconciliation processes, and eliminate errors that can happen when you manually enter the information on a bank website.  

This extension supports file formats for several Danish banks. When you export payment information to a file, the extension packages the data into the format that your bank requires. For example, the formats include Bankdata-V3, BEC, SDC, and FIK, which many different banks use, and some that are more specialized for certain banks, for example, Danske Bank and Nordea. The extension also includes some formats for importing and reconciling bank statements.  

> [!Note]
> To use the extension, you must know the format that your bank or vendor requires. Some banks or vendors provide this information on their websites; however, you might need to contact their customer service to get the information.  

## Supported Bank Formats
This extension can apply the following file formats for payment files:  

* BANKDATA-V3  
* BEC-INDLAND  
* BEC-CSV  
* DANSKEBANK-CMKV  
* DANSKEBANK-CMKXKSX  
* DANSKEBANK  
* FIK71  
* NORDEA-ERHVERV-CSV  
* NORDEA  
* NORDEA-UNITEL-V3  
* SDC  
* SDC-CSV  

## To set up the extension

There are a few steps to get started.  

* Allow payment data exports. To help protect your data, this is not readily available.  
* Set up purchase and payables so that you do not require external document numbers on invoices. If needed, you can use the reference number to refer to a specific invoice.  
* Specify the payment method for each vendor. Payment methods define how you pay invoices from the vendor. For example, Bank, Cash, Check, or Account.  
* Specify the type of format to use for each of your bank accounts. For example, NORDEA, DANSKEBANK, SDC, and so on.  

Additionally, you must assign vendors to a domestic **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** and a **Vendor Posting Group**. The Country/Region setting for the vendor must be Denmark (DK). For more information, see [Setting Up Posting Groups](finance-posting-groups.md).  

### To allow [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to export payment data

# FAQ for marketing text suggestions with Copilot

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the [!INCLUDE[feature-marketing-text-suggestions](includes/feature-marketing-text-suggestions.md)] feature in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What is item marketing text suggestions?

Copilot provides writing assistance for users responsible for authoring marketing text (also known as copy) on items in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This feature is known as [!INCLUDE[feature-marketing-text-suggestions](includes/feature-marketing-text-suggestions.md)]. The [!INCLUDE[feature-marketing-text-suggestions](includes/feature-marketing-text-suggestions.md)] feature provides writing assistance for users responsible for authoring marketing text (also known as *copy*) on items in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The feature is available on any item card in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To use it, just open an item and then select **Marketing Text** > **Draft with Copilot**. This action automatically generates a text suggestion that's engaging, creative, and specific to the item that's shown. Suggestions are based on various inputs, including:

- The item's attributes, category, and name.
- Personal writing style preferences, like tone of voice, emphasized quality, format and length.

You can change the value of these input options to influence the outcome of the AI-generated text. Before you save a suggestion, you can easily review and edit it for accuracy or try another suggestion.

Some key benefits of this feature include:

- Decreases the time used on copy writing, which can accelerate time-to-market for items being sold in online shops.
- Unlocks creativity to provide more engaging product descriptions.
- Improves consistency of marketing material for product lines.

## What are the system's capabilities?

The [!INCLUDE[feature-marketing-text-suggestions](includes/feature-marketing-text-suggestions.md)] feature uses Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service to access powerful language models that analyze and generate natural language. These models have been trained on a wide body of text datasets. As a result, Copilot can generate suggested, personalized responses in English based on a minimal amount of input data, like an item's attributes, category, or description. Learn more about Azure OpenAI Service at [Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview).

## What is the system's intended use?

This feature is intended to assist users in creating marketing text for items in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Writers use the feature to quickly get compelling and engaging text suggestions, which are then reviewed and edited for accuracy. 

## How was item marketing text evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

- The feature underwent extensive testing where numerous texts in different languages were evaluated by language experts against various criteria. Testing was based on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s demonstration data and other fictitious product catalogs.
- This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft at [Empowering responsible AI practices](https://aka.ms/RAI).

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content?

Microsoft has various systems in place to ensure Copilot capabilities remain operational and generate content of the highest quality.

- Users have the opportunity to provide feedback to report inappropriate content and improve the functionality.

  - If you encounter inappropriate generated content, report it to Microsoft by using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249810). 

    Microsoft might disable the Copilot-driven features for selected customers if abuse of the functionality is detected. 

  - We track user feedback on [!INCLUDE[feature-marketing-text-suggestions](includes/feature-marketing-text-suggestions.md)] to help us improve suggestions. 

    You provide feedback by using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icon on the **Copilot** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. We gather the telemetry of these gestures for each AI output that you submit feedback for.

title: Set Up FA User-Defined Depreciation Method

# Set Up Fixed Assets with User-Defined Depreciation Methods

You can use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to set up the user-defined depreciation methods as described here.

For each user-defined method, you use the **Depreciation Tables** page, where you must enter a depreciation percentage for each period (month, quarter, year, or accounting period). Then, when you assign a depreciation book with a user-defined method to a fixed asset, you must set the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** and **Depreciation Starting Date** fields on the **FA Depreciation Books** page for the specific fixed asset.  

The formula for calculating the depreciation amounts is:  

*Depreciation Amount = (Depreciation % x Number of Depreciation Days x Depr. Basis) / (100 x 360)*


> [!NOTE]  
> While the date in the field **First User-Defined Depr. Date** is used to determine the time intervals, it is the **Depreciation Starting Date** that is used to determine the number of depreciation days. If the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** is earlier than the **Depreciation Starting Date**, the percentage for the first period in the depreciation table will be only partially used when the program calculates the first depreciation. This means that the asset will not be completely depreciated by the end of the last period.

## To assign a depreciation book to a fixed asset with a user-defined depreciation method

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the fixed asset that you want to set up a fixed asset depreciation book for.
3. Choose the **Related** action, and then choose **Fixed Asset**, and then **Depreciation Books**. This opens the **FA Depreciation Books** page.

   By default, some of the fields that need to be filled in per the instructions below are hidden, so you must display them. To do this you need to personalize the page. For more information, see [To start personalizing a page through the Personalizing banner](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).
4. In the field **Depreciation Method**, select **User-Defined**.
5. In the field **Depreciation Table Code**, select the **Depreciation Table** you want to use.
6. In the field **Depreciation Starting Date**, select the starting date for the depreciation calculation.
7. When you use a user-defined method, the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** field must be set to a date that is the same or earlier than the field **Depreciation Starting Date**. If you have selected a value in the **Period Length** field in the depreciation table, the date in the field **First User-Defined Depr. Date** must be the starting date of an accounting period.
8. Either fill in the field **No. of Depreciation Years** or the field **Depreciation Ending Date**. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] 

## To set up user-defined depreciation methods

On the **Depreciation Table** page, you can set up user-defined depreciation methods. For example, you can set up depreciation based on number of units.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Tables**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Depreciation Table List** page, choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **Depreciation Table Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

> [!TIP]
> Use the **Create Sum of Digits Table** function to define a depreciation table based on the *Sum of Digits* method.

With the *Sum of Digits* method, if a fixed asset is depreciated over 4 years, then the depreciation for each year is calculated in the following way:

Sum of Digits = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
Depreciation:

* Year 1 = 4/10  
* Year 2 = 3/10  
* Year 3 = 2/10  
* Year 4 = 1/10  

### Depreciation Based on Number of Units

This user-defined method can also be used to depreciate based on number of units, for example, in the case of production machines with an established lifetime capacity. On the **Depreciation Tables** page, you can enter the number of units that can be produced in each period (month, quarter, year,or accounting period).  

### Example - User-defined Depreciation

You use a depreciation method that allows you to depreciate assets in an accelerated manner for income tax purposes.  

You would use the following depreciation rates for a fixed asset with a three-year lifetime for tax purposes:  

* Year 1: 25%  
* Year 2: 38%  
* Year 3: 37%  

The acquisition cost is LCY 100,000, and the depreciable lifetime is five years. Depreciation is calculated annually.  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |360 |-25,000.00 |75,000.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |360 |-38,000.00 |37,000.00 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |360 |-37,000.00 |0 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |None |None |0 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |None |None |0 |

In the previous example, both the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** and **Depreciation Starting Date** fields would be set to 01/01/20 in the **FA Depreciation Books** page for the specific fixed asset. If, however, the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** field contained 01/01/20 and the **Depreciation Starting Date** field contained 04/01/20, the result would be:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |270 |-18,750.00 |81,250.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |360 |-38,000.00 |42,250.00 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |360 |-37,000.00 |6,250.00 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |90 |-6,250.00 |0 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |None |None |0 |

# Set Up Units of Measure

As part of setting up your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you set up general units of measure on the **Units of Measure** page. Then, when you register new items, you specify the base unit of measure on the **Item Card** page. You can also add units of measure later.  

You can set up multiple units of measure for an item:

- Assign a base unit of measure to the item on the Item Card page. The base unit of measure defines how you store it in inventory and is the basis for conversion to alternate units of measure.
- Assign alternate units of measure to purchase, production, or sales documents to specify how many units of the base unit of measure you handle at a time in those processes. For example, you might buy the item on pallets and only use single pieces in your production.

If an item is stocked in one unit of measure but produced in another, a production order is created that uses a manufacturing batch unit of measure to calculate the correct quantity of the components during the **Refresh Production Order** batch job. An example of a manufacturing batch unit of measure calculation is when a manufactured item is stocked in pieces but produced in tons. To learn more, go to [Work with Manufacturing Batch Units of Measure](production-how-to-use-the-manufacturing-batch-unit-of-measure.md).  

Another tool that makes it easier to work with multiple units of measure for items is the ability to specify a rounding precision for base units of measure. Specifying a rounding precision provides guidance on what someone should enter for a given business process, and helps reduce rounding issues. When you use alternate units of measure, the value in the **Qty. per Unit of Measure** field helps calculate the quantity in the base unit of measure, which can lead to rounding issues. For example, imagine you're receiving one box that contains six items. When the box arrives at your warehouse, you discover that one of the six items is missing. You decide not to post the receipt of one box, but instead change the quantity received to five of six pieces. That decision would lead to a receipt of 4.99998 pieces, rather than five. On the **Item Units of Measure** page, the **Quantity Rounding Precision** field lets you specify a value that converts the quantity to a number that's easier to understand. Continuing with the example, we would enter **1** in the field to round up to an even five pieces.

## To set up units of measure

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Units of Measure**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. A new empty line is inserted.  
3. Fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. If you know that your organization sells items with this unit of measure to customers in other countries/regions, you can add translations.  
    1. Select the code for which you want to set up translations, and then choose the **Translations** action.
    2. In the **Language Code** field, select the drop-down arrow to see a list of available language codes. Select the language code for which you want to enter a translation, and then choose the OK button to copy the code to the field.
    3. In the **Description** field, enter the appropriate text.
5. Repeat the previous steps for any other units of measure that you want to add.  

When you register a new item, you can choose the base unit of measure from the list of units of measure that you set up. You can also set up multiple units of measure for an item.  

## To set up multiple item units of measure

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of the item for which you want to set up alternate units of measure.
3. Choose the **Units of Measure** action. The **Item Units of Measure** page opens.
4. If the **Base Unit of Measure** field on the item card is filled, then that unit of measure is already set up.
5. Choose the **New** action. A new empty line is inserted.
6. In the **Code** field, enter the name of the unit of measure. Alternatively, choose the field to select from the unit of measure codes that are in the database.
7. In the **Qty. per Unit of Measure** field, enter how many units of the base unit of measure the new unit of measure contains.
8. Optionally, in the **Height**, **Width**, **Length**, and **Weight** fields, specify precise information about the size of one unit of measure so that the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can calculate how many of each item unit can be placed in any given bin. The **Cubage** field is calculated automatically based on **Height**, **Width**, and **Length**.

    If any of these fields contain a value other than 0, then that measure is used during all processes that involve placing items in a bin: put-away, movements, receipts, shipments, picks, and adjustments. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks the sum of each physical measure of the items being put away. It also checks the items already in the bin against the maximum size or other measure that can fit into a bin. This information comes from the bin capacity policy on the location card where you store this item. In other words, you must use the same unit measure for each dimension across all item units of measure - use kilograms or pounds for weight, for example, but be consistent.
9. Repeat steps 5 through 7 to set up all the alternate units of measure that you want to use in different processes for this item.

    In the **Base Unit of Measure** field at the bottom of the window, you can view or change the item's base unit of measure. You can also change the base unit of measure in the **Base Unit of Measure** field on the item card. In the **Item Units of Measure** page, the base unit of measure must have the value **1** in the **Qty. per Unit of Measure** field.

You can now use the alternate units of measure on purchase, production, and sales documents. To learn more, go to [To enter a default unit of measure code for sales and purchasing transactions](#to-enter-a-default-unit-of-measure-code-for-sales-and-purchasing-transactions).  

## To set up unit of measure translations

When you sell items to foreign customers, you might want to specify the unit of measure in the customer's language. You can do that by specifying translations for units of measure.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Units of Measure**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the code for which you want to set up translations, and then choose the **Translations** action.
3. In the **Language Code** field, select the drop-down arrow to see a list of available language codes. Select the language code for which you want to enter a translation, and then choose the OK button to copy the code to the field.
4. In the **Description** field, enter the appropriate text.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for the unit of measure codes and the languages for which you want to enter translations.

## To enter a default unit of measure code for sales and purchasing transactions

If you usually buy or sell in units different from the base unit of measure, you can specify separate units of measure for purchases and sales. To use separate units of measure, set up the units of measure on the **Item Units of Measure** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant item card for which you want to specify a default sales or purchase unit of measure code.
3. For sales, on the **Invoicing** FastTab, in the **Sales Unit of Measure** field, open the **Item Units of Measure** page.
4. For purchasing, on the **Replenishment** FastTab, in the **Purch. Unit of Measure** field, open the **Item Units of Measure** page.
5. Select the code you want to set up as the default unit of measure for sales or purchasing respectively, and then choose the **OK** button.

# Track items with serial, lot, and package numbers

You can assign serial numbers, lot numbers, and package numbers to outbound and inbound documents. The posted item tracking entries display on the related item ledger entries. You track items on the **Item Tracking Lines** page, which you can open from inbound or outbound documents.

The quantity fields at the top of the **Item Tracking Lines** page display the quantities and sums of item tracking numbers that are defined on the lines. The quantities must correspond to the quantities on the document lines, which is indicated by *0* in the **Undefined** fields.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the availability information on the **Item Tracking Lines** page when you open the page. It doesn't update the information while you have the page open, even if changes occur in inventory or on other documents during that time.

> [!NOTE]  
> In order for the features described in this article to work, you must set up item tracking. To learn more, go to [Set Up Item Tracking with Serial, Lot, and Package Numbers](inventory-how-setup-item-tracking.md).

## Item tracking availability

When you work with serial, lot, and package numbers, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates availability information and shows it on various item tracking pages. It shows how much of a lot, package, or serial number is used on other documents. This information helps reduce errors and uncertainty caused by double allocations.

On the **Item Tracking Lines** page, a warning icon might display in the **Availability, Lot No.** or **Availability, Serial No.** field for the following reasons:

* Some or all of the quantity you selected is already used in other documents.
* The lot or serial number isn't available.

The **Lot No./Serial No.-List**, **Lot No./Serial No.-Availability**, and the **Item Tracking - Select Entries** pages show the quantity of an item that's in use. The following table lists the relevant fields.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|  
|**Total Quantity**|The total number of an item currently in inventory.|
|**Total Requested Quantity**|The total number of items that are requested in this and other documents.|
|**Current Pending Quantity**|The number of items that are requested on the current document but that isn't posted.|
|**Current Requested Quantity**|The number of requested items that the current document will use.|
|**Total Available Quantity**|The total number of items in inventory, minus the quantity of the requested item on this and other documents (total requested quantity), minus the requested quantity that isn't yet posted on this document (current pending quantity).|

If you work on the **Item Tracking Lines** page for a long time, or if its a popular item involved in many activities, you can choose the **Refresh Availability** action. Also, the availability of the item is automatically rechecked when you close the page to confirm that there aren't availability problems.

## To assign serial or lot numbers during an inbound transaction

You might want to track items from the moment they arrive. In that case, the purchase order is often the central document. However, you can do item tracking from any inbound document and its posted entries display in the related item ledger entries.

The tracking numbers automatically transfer to all outbound warehouse activities.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Either open an existing purchase order or create a new purchase order.
3. Select the document line, and on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Item Tracking Lines** action to open the **Edit - Item Tracking Lines** page.  

   You can assign serial or lot numbers in the following ways:  
   * Automatically, by selecting **Process** then choosing **Assign Serial No.** or **Assign Lot No.** to assign serial/lot numbers from predefined number series.  
   * Automatically, by selecting **Process** then choosing **Create Customized SN** to assign serial/lot numbers based on number series you define specifically for the arrived items.  
   * Manually, by entering serial or lot numbers directly, for example, the vendor's numbers.  
   * Manually, by assigning a specific number to each item unit.  

4. To assign automatically, choose the **Create Customized SN** action.  
5. In the **Customized SN** field, enter the starting number of a descriptive serial number series. For example, **S/N-Vend0001**.  
6. In the **Increment** field, enter 1 to define that each sequential number increases by one.  

    The **Quantity to Create** field contains the line quantity by default, but you can modify it.  

7. Select the **Create New Lot No.** checkbox to organize the new serial numbers in a distinct lot.  
8. Choose the **OK** button.  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a lot number with individual serial numbers according to the item quantity on the document line. The number is prefixed with the value you entered in the **Customized SN** field. For example, starting from **S/N-Vend0001**.  

The quantity fields in the header dynamically display the quantities and sums of the item tracking numbers you define on the page. The quantities must correspond to the quantities on the document lines, which is indicated by **0** in the **Undefined** field.  

When you post the document, the item tracking entries transfer to the item ledger entries.

### To handle serial and lot numbers when getting receipt lines from a purchase invoice

When you get posted receipt or shipment lines from related invoices or credit memos, item tracking lines on the warehouse documents transfer automatically. However, they're processed in a special way.

The functionality supports the following inbound processes:  

* **Get Receipt Lines** - from a purchase invoice.  
* **Get Return Shipment Lines** - from a purchase credit memo.  

The functionality supports the following outbound processes:  

* **Get Shipment Lines** - from a sales invoice or combined shipments.  
* **Get Return Receipt Lines** - from a sales credit memo.  

In these cases, the item tracking lines transfer to the invoice or credit memo, but the **Item Tracking Lines** page doesn't let you change the serial or lot numbers. You can only change the quantities.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then select the related link.  
2. Open a purchase invoice for items that are purchase with serial or lot numbers.  
3. From a purchase invoice line, on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Get Receipt Lines** action.  
4. On the **Get Receipt Lines** page, select a receipt line that has item tracking lines, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    The source document is copied to the purchase invoice as a new line, and its item tracking lines are copied to the underlying **Item Tracking Lines** page.  

5. On the purchase invoice, select the transferred receipt line.  
6. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Item Tracking Lines** action to find the transferred item tracking lines.  

You can't change the **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields. However, you can delete complete lines or change the quantities to match changes on the source line.  

## To assign a serial or lot number during an outbound transaction

Outbound handling of serial or lot numbers is a frequent task in different warehouse processes. There are two ways to add serial and lot numbers to outbound transactions:  

* Select from existing serial or lot numbers. This selection applies when item tracking numbers are already assigned in an inbound transaction.
* Assign new serial or lot numbers for outbound transactions. This assignment applies when item tracking numbers aren't assigned to items until they're sold and ready to ship.

### To select from existing serial or lot numbers  

When you work with items that require item tracking, and you're creating outbound transactions, you'll typically from select existing lot or serial numbers.

1. From any outbound document, select the line that you want to select serial or lot numbers for.  
2. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, then **Related Information**, and then select **Item Tracking Lines**.  
3. On the **Item Tracking Lines** page, you have three options for specifying lot or serial number:  

   * Select the **Serial No.** field, and then select a number on the **Serial No. List** page.
   * Select the **Lot No.** field, and then select a number on the **Lot No. List** page. Then, select the **Serial No.** field, and select a number on the **Serial No. List** page.
   * Select the **Process** action, and then choose **Select Entries**. The **Select Entries** page shows all lot and serial numbers along with availability information.

4. In the **Selected Quantity** field, enter the quantity of each lot or serial number to use.
5. Choose the **OK** button. The item tracking information transfers to the **Item Tracking Lines** page.  

The quantity fields in the header dynamically display the quantities and sums of the item tracking numbers you define on the page. The quantities must correspond to the quantities on the document line, which is indicated by **0** in the **Undefined** field.  

When you post the document line, the item tracking information transfers to the associated item ledger entries.

### To assign new serial or lot numbers  

This process applies when items don't have serial or lot numbers while they're in inventory. Instead, you assign item tracking numbers when the items are sold and ready to be shipped. In this case, you typically assign numbers from a predefined number series.

1. Select the relevant document, for example a sales invoice or sales order, and on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, then **Related Information**, and then choose the **Item Tracking Lines** action.  

    You can assign item tracking numbers in the following ways:  
    * Automatically, from a predefined number series: Choose the **Assign Serial No.** or **Assign Lot No.** action.  
    * Automatically, based on parameters you define specifically for the outbound item: Choose the **Create Customized SN** action.  
    * Manually, by entering serial or lot numbers without using a number series.  

2. For this procedure, assign a serial number automatically by choosing **Assign Serial No.**  

    The **Quantity to Create** field contains the line quantity by default, but you can change it.  
3. Select the **Create New Lot No.** field to organize the new serial numbers in a distinct lot.  
4. Choose the **OK** button to create a lot number and new individual serial numbers according to the quantity to handle on the related document line.  

The quantity fields at the top dynamically display the quantities and sums of the item tracking numbers that you define on the page. The quantities must correspond to the quantities on the document line, which is indicated by **0** in the **Undefined** field.  

When the document is posted, the item tracking entries transfer to the item ledger entries.

### Assign tracking numbers on source documents

Some companies define specific serial or lot numbers on source document, such as sales orders. For example, if a customer requests a specific lot. When you create the inventory pick or warehouse pick document from an outbound source document where serial or lot numbers are already defined, you can't change any fields on the **Item Tracking Lines** page under the inventory pick. The one exception is the **Qty. to Handle** field. In that case, the inventory pick lines specify the item tracking numbers on individual take and place lines. The quantity is already split into unique serial or lot number combinations because the sales order specifies the item tracking numbers to ship.

## To handle serial and lot numbers on transfer orders

Procedures for handling serial and lot numbers that you transfer between different locations are similar to when you sell or purchase items.  

However, transfer orders are unique in that shipment and receipt are both done from the same transfer line and use the same instance of the **Item Tracking Lines** page. Item tracking numbers that shipped from one location must be received unchanged at the other location.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the transfer order you want to process. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, choose the **Item Tracking Lines** action, and then choose the **Shipment** action.  
3. On the **Item Tracking Lines** page, assign or select serial or lot numbers as for any other outbound item transaction.  

    When you handle serial and lot numbers for transfer items, numbers are often already assigned numbers. Therefore, you typically choose from existing serial or lot numbers.  

4. Post the transfer order, first ship and then receive, to record that the items are transferred and carry their item tracking entries.  

During the transfer, you can't change values on the **Item Tracking Lines** page.  

## To record extra serial or lot number information

If you need to link special information to an item tracking number, for example, for quality assurance, you can do so on a serial or lot number information card.

1. Open a document that has serial or lot numbers assigned.
2. Open the **Item Tracking Lines** page for the item you want to enter information for.
3. Choose the **Line** action and then, for example, the **Serial No. Information Card** action.  
4. Choose the plus sign **(+)** sign at the top of the list to create a new entry. The **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields are prefilled from the item tracking line.
5. Enter a short piece of information in the **Description** field, for example about the condition of the item.  
6. Choose the **Related** action, choose the **Serial No.** action, and then choose the **Comment** action to create a separate comment record.  
7. Select the **Blocked** field to exclude the serial or lot number from any transactions.  

<!--If you create serial numbers in bulk by using the **Create Customized SN** or **Assign Serial No.** actions, you can enable **Create SN Information** and an information card will be created for each tracking line.

Alternatively, you can create an information card when you post journals or documents. On the **Item Tracking Code** page, turn on the **Create SN Info. on posting** or **Create SN Info. on posting** toggles. -->

You can modify created serial or lot information cards later.

## To modify existing serial or lot number information

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select an item that has an item tracking code and has serial or lot number information.
3. From the **Item Card** page, choose the **Related** action, choose the **Related** action, choose the **Entries** action, and then choose **Ledger Entries**.
4. Choose the **Lot No.** or **Serial No.** field. If information exists for the item tracking number, then the **Lot No. Information List** or **Serial No. Information List** page opens.  
5. Select a card, and then choose the **Lot No./Serial No. Information Card** action.  
6. Modify the short description text, the comment record, or the **Blocked** field.  

You can't change the serial or lot numbers or quantities. To do that, you must reclassify the item ledger entry. To learn more about reclassification, go to [To reclassify lot or serial numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md#to-reclassify-serial-or-lot-numbers).

## To reclassify serial or lot numbers

Reclassifying item tracking for an item means to change a lot or serial number to a new lot or serial number, or changing the expiration date to a new expiration date. If you use lots, you can also merge multiple lots into one. Use an item reclassification journal to do these tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies that each line has a unique combination of serial, lot, and/or package numbers. If you want to split a lot, package, or a lot and package into several lots or packages, you must use multiple journal lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Reclassification Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the line with the relevant information. For more information, see [Count Inventory Using Documents](inventory-how-count-inventory-with-documents.md) or [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory Using Journals](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md).
3. Choose the **Item Tracking Lines** action.  
4. In the **Serial Nos.** or **Lot Nos.** field, select the current serial or lot number.  
5. If you want to enter a new item tracking number, enter it in the **New Serial No.** or **New Lot No.** field. If you want, you can merge one or more lots to one new or existing lot.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you reclassify expiration dates, items with the earliest expiration dates for outbound transactions are suggested first. To learn more, go to [Picking by FEFO](warehouse-picking-by-fefo.md).  

6. To specify a new expiration date for the serial or lot number, enter it in the **New Expiration Date** field.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > * If you're reclassifying a lot to the same lot number but with a different expiration date, you must reclassify the entire lot using one item reclassification journal line.
    > * If you're reclassifying more than one lot to one new lot number, meaning you're merging several lots into one new lot, you must give all lots the the same new expiration date.
    > * If you're reclassifying one existing lot to a second existing lot that has a different expiration date, you must use the expiration date from the second lot.
    > * If you leave the **New Expiration Date** field blank, the lot or serial number is reclassified with a blank expiration date.  

7. If you have existing information on the old serial or lot number, you can copy it to the new serial or lot number.  

    1. On the **Item Tracking Lines** page, choose the **New Serial No. Information** action or the **New Lot No. Information** action.  
    2. To copy information from the old lot or serial number, choose the **Copy Info** action.  
    3. In the information list page, select the lot or serial number that you would like to copy from, and choose the **OK** button.  

8. If you want to modify the existing information for the lot or serial number, you can record lot or serial information.  
9. Post the journal to link the renewed item tracking numbers or expiration dates to the associated item ledger entry

## Scan barcodes with the Business Central mobile app

[!INCLUDE [barcode-mobile-app](includes/barcode-mobile-app.md)]

On the **Item Tracking Lines** page, if you want to scan several serial, lot, or package barcodes, you can use the **Scan multiple** action. After you scan a barcode, its value is entered in the field on the page and the next quick-entry field becomes available. You can also use the barcode scanner icon to populate specific field.

The following tables list the pages that support barcode scanning for item tracking from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app.

# Sustainability value chain in assembly orders

The requirement for enabling the use of the sustainability value chain in the assembly orders processes is that you enable the **Enable Value Chain tracking**, **Item Emissions**, and **Resource Emissions** fields on the **Sustainability Setup** page.  

To do so, follow next steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Check whether the basic setup already exists. If it doesn't, follow [these instructions](finance-sustainability-setup.md) to set it up.  
3. On the **Procurement** FastTab, fill in the following fields:
   1. **Enable Value Chain tracking** to enable sustainability value entries postings through value chain operations and the visibility of these fields in operational documents and journals.
   2. **Item Emissions** to enable a default sustainability account and emissions on the **Item Card** page.
   3. **Resource Emissions** to enable default a sustainability account and emissions on the **Resource Card** page.
5. Close the page.

## Working with assembly orders  

To learn more about how to work with assembly orders, go to [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md). However, the connection of assembly orders with the sustainability value chain is demonstrated two steps:

- Tracking emissions for items and resources consumed during the assembly process.
- Transfer the total emission values to the assembly items.  

To use an assembly order in the sustainability value chain process, add CO2e (carbon equivalent) emissions in all lines. For each line, fill in the **Total CO2e** field with the total emission for the quantity related to the item or resource on the assembly order line.

To do so, follow next steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assembly orders**, and then select the related link.
2. Create a new assembly order, or open the existing order you want to use. To learn more about assembly orders, go to [To assemble an item to stock](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md#to-assemble-an-item-to-stock).
3. If your items and resources in the assembly order lines already have default sustainability accounts and emissions, the values are added in the **Sustainability Account No.** and **Total CO2e** fields. You can change these values if you want.
4. If you didn't have these default values for your items or resources, choose a **Sustainability Account No.**, and then fill in the **Total CO2e** field with the total emission amount for this line. The amount is for the whole quantity, regardless how many items are assembled at this moment. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recalculates the value for the specific consumption.

> [!NOTE]
> Although the total CO2e emission amount displays for each line, there's a field called **CO2e per Unit**. Its value comes from the item or resource, and is used for calculations. However, if you change the **Total CO2e** field on the line, the **CO2e per Unit** recalculates based on the total emission and quantity for that line.  

5. On the **Posting** FastTab, **CO2e per Unit** and **Total CO2e** fields show the total calculated emission per unit of the assembled item after posting.
6. If the values are correct, choose the **Post** action to post the order.
7. After you post the order, if your **Quantity to Assemble** was less than the **Quantity**, the **Posted Total CO2e** fields on the header and lines update with the belonging total CO2e emission.  

After you post the order, you can open the **Posted Assembly Order** page to find the **Total CO2e** field on the **Posting** FastTab. The value in the **CO2e per Unit** field is also updated for the newly assembled item. You can also check the result by opening the **Item Card** page for the item used as the assembled item to verify that the **CO2e per Unit** field updated based on the values from the posted assembly order.

# Save and personalize list views

When you set a filter on a list and you want to keep the filter for later, you can save it as a view. To learn more about filtering lists, go to [Set filters on lists](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#set-filters-on-lists).

If views exist, the **Views** group appears at the top of the filter pane. Views are variations of the list that is preconfigured with filters. You can define and save as many views as you want per list. The views will be available the next time you open the list, from any device or browser.

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## To save a view

1. Open any list page.
2. Select ![Filter pane icon.](media/open-filter-pane-icon.png "Filter pane icon") at the top of the list or select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd>.
3. Set one or more new filters. To learn more, go to [Set filters on lists](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#set-filters-on-lists).
4. When you set  the filters, choose the ![Save View.](media/save_view_icon.png "Save View") icon.

    If you set a filter for a list view that was already saved as a view, the existing view updates when you save.
5. If you're saving a new view, enter a name for the view in the **All (Copy)** box, such as "Items I own".
6. To accept the name, select the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key or move the cursor from the text box.

If you don't give it a name, the default name is **All (Copy)**.

> [!TIP]
> Not seeing the ![Save View](media/save_view_icon.png "Save View") icon? To learn more, go to [Why don't I have a Save icon](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-views-faq#save).

## To rename or remove a view

1. For the view that currently displays the list, choose the ![Show more options.](media/show-more-options-icon.png "Show more options") icon to see which options are available.
2. Choose either the **Rename** or the **Remove** action.

## Managing Many Views

As the number of views on a page grows, you might need more control over how views are presented in the filter pane. With the **Personalizing** banner, you can hide unwanted views or reorder your views to get the perfect sequence. To learn more, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

# Moving Annual Total (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Moving Annual Total (MAT)** report calculates a total of sales over the last 12 months. This is a rolling calculation where the date is continually moving.

The report showcases the sales amount moving annual total (MAT), and compares it to the MAT for the previous period.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-moving-annual-total.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Moving Annual Total Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-moving-annual-total.png":::

## Use the report

Business leaders and managers use the report to identify how the MAT is performing across the period.

Business leaders can use the report to monitor the overall sales performance of your organization over the last 12 months. By analyzing the [Moving Annual Total (MAT)](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-mat-fiscal) and [Previous Year Moving Annual Total (PYMAT)](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-pymat-fiscal) figures, you can identify trends in sales growth and compare your organization's performance to the previous year. You can also use the [Moving Annual Total Growth Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg-fiscal) and [Growth %](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg--fiscal) figures to identify periods that performed well or didn't meet the growth expectation.

For example, if you notice that your organization's sales growth is stagnant or declining, you can use this information to develop a plan that focuses on improving sales and increasing marketing efforts during these periods.

Sales managers can use the report to analyze sales data over the last 12 months and gain insights into sales trends. By drilling down into the sales figures for specific categories, you can identify areas of strength and weakness in your sales performance. For example, you might notice that sales of some items have declined over the last few months while the sales of other items are increasing.

The monthly analysis helps you identify when sales started to decline and take necessary actions to introduce products that align with the new trend to increase sales and meet customer demand. With this information, you can make data-driven decisions to optimize your sales strategy and drive revenue growth for your company.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Moving Annual Total (MAT)**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-mat-fiscal)
- [**Previous Year Moving Annual Total (PYMAT)**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-pymat-fiscal)
- [**Moving Annual Total Growth Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg-fiscal)
- [**Moving Annual Total Growth %**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg--fiscal)
- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

# Manage Budgets for Fixed Assets

You can set up budgeted fixed assets. For example, this lets you include anticipated acquisitions and sales in reports.  

To prepare your budgeted income statement, budgeted balance sheet, and cash budget, you need information about future investments, disposals and depreciation of fixed assets. You can get this information from the **Fixed Asset - Projected Value** report. Before you print this report, you must prepare the budget.  

## To budget the acquisition cost of a fixed asset

To prepare a budget, you have to set up fixed asset cards for fixed assets that you intend to buy in the future. The budget fixed assets are set up as ordinary fixed assets, but it must be set up to not post to the general ledger.

When you post the acquisition cost, you enter the number of the budgeted fixed asset in the **Budgeted FA No.** field. This will post an acquisition cost with an opposite sign for the budgeted asset. This means that the total acquisition cost on the budgeted asset is the difference between the budgeted and the actual acquisition cost.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new fixed asset card for the budgeted fixed asset.
3. Select the **Budgeted Asset** check box to prevent posting to the general ledger.
4. Fill in the remaining fields, assign a depreciation book, and then post the first acquisition cost with the budgeted fixed asset entered in the **Budgeted FA No.** field on the journal line. For more information, see [Acquire Fixed Assets](fa-how-acquire.md).

## To budget the disposal of a fixed asset

If you plan to sell assets within the budget period, you can enter information about sales price and sales date.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the fixed asset to be disposed of, and then choose the **Depreciation Books** action.
3. On the **FA Depreciation Books** page, fill in the **Projected Disposal Date** and **Projected Proceeds on Disposal** fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To view projected disposal values

To see the projected disposal values and have the gain and loss calculated, you can use the **FA Projected Value** report.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Projected Value**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **Print** or **Preview** button.

## To budget depreciation

You can use the **Fixed Asset - Projected Value** report to calculate future depreciation. The report shows the book value and accumulated depreciation at the start of the selected period, changes during the period, and the book value and accumulated depreciation at the end of the selected period.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Projected Value**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.
3. To see total values for all assets, clear the **Print per Fixed Asset** check box.
4. Leave the **Fixed Asset** FastTab blank to have all assets included. In the **Budgeted Asset** field, enter **No** to exclude budgeted assets or **Yes** to see budgeted assets only.
5. Choose the **Print** or **Preview** button.

# Walkthrough: Receiving and Putting Away in Basic Warehouse Configurations

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

The following walkthrough demonstrates method B in the previous table.  

## About this walkthrough  

In basic warehouse configurations where your location is set up to require put-away processing but not receive processing, use the **Inventory Put-away** page to record and post put-away and receipt information for your inbound source documents. The following documents are inbound source documents:

* Purchase order
* Sales return order
* Inbound transfer order
* Production order with output that's ready to be put away

> [!NOTE]
> Even though the settings are called **Require Pick** and **Require Put-away**, you can still post receipts and shipments directly from the source business documents at locations where you select these checkboxes.  

This walkthrough demonstrates the following tasks:  

* Set up SILVER location for inventory put aways.  
* Set up SILVER location for bin handling.  
* Define a default bin for item LS-81. (LS-75 is already set up in CRONUS.)  
* Create a purchase order for vendor 10000 for 40 loudspeakers.  
* Verify that the put-away bins are preset by setup.  
* Release the purchase order for warehouse handling.  
* Create an inventory put-away based on a released source document.  
* Verify that the put-away bins are inherited from the purchase order.  
* Register the warehouse movement into the warehouse and post the purchase receipt for the source purchase order.  

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [locations-cronus](includes/locations-cronus.md)]

## Roles  

The following user roles perform the tasks that this walkthrough demonstrates:  

* Warehouse Manager  
* Purchasing Agent  
* Warehouse Worker  

## Prerequisites  

To complete this walkthrough, you'll need:  

* CRONUS International Ltd. data  
* To be a warehouse employee at SILVER location. To set yourself up, follow these steps:  

    1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
    2. Choose the **User ID** field, and select your user account on the **Users** page.  
    3. In the **Location Code** field, choose **SILVER**.  
    4. Select the **Default** checkbox.  

## Story  

Ellen, the warehouse manager at CRONUS International Ltd., creates a purchase order for 10 units of item LS-75 and 30 units of item LS-81 from vendor 10000 to be delivered to SILVER Warehouse. When the delivery arrives at the warehouse, John, the warehouse worker, puts the items away in the default bins defined for the items. When John posts the put-away, the items are posted as received into inventory and available for sale or other demand.  

## Setting up the location  

Settings on the **Location Card** page define the company's warehouse flows.  

### To set up the location  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the SILVER location card.  
3. Turn on the **Require Put-away** toggle.  

    Set up a default bin for the two item numbers to control where they're put away.  

4. Choose the **Bins** action.  
5. Select the first row, for bin **S-01-0001**, and then choose the **Contents** action.  

    Notice on the **Bin Content** page that item **LS-75** is already set up as content in bin S-01-0001.  

6. Choose the **New** action.  
7. Select the **Fixed** and the **Default** fields.  
8. In the **Item No.** field, enter **LS-81**.  

## Create the purchase order  

Purchase orders are the most common type of inbound source document.  

### To create the purchase order  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Create a purchase order for vendor 10000 on the work date (January 23) with the following purchase order lines.  

    |Item|Location code|Bin code|Quantity|  
    |----------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|  
    |LS_75|SILVER|S-01-0001|10|  
    |LS-81|SILVER|S-01-0001|30|  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The bin code is entered automatically according to the setup you created in the [Setting up the location](#setting-up-the-location) section.  

    Next, notify the warehouse that the purchase order is ready for warehouse handling when the delivery arrives.  

4. Choose the **Release** action.  

    The delivery of loudspeakers from vendor 10000 has arrived at SILVER warehouse, and John proceeds to put them away.  

## Receive and put the items away  

Use the **Inventory Put-away** page to manage all inbound warehouse activities for a specific source document, such as a purchase order.  

### To receive and put the items away  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Put-aways**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Select the **Source Document** field, and then select **Purchase Order**.  
4. Select the **Source No.** field, select the line for the purchase from vendor 10000, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    Alternatively, choose the **Get Source Document** action, and then select the purchase order.  

5. Choose the **Autofill Qty. to Handle** action.  

    Alternatively, in the **Qty. to Handle** field, enter 10 and 30 respectively on the two inventory put-away lines.  

6. Choose the **Post** action, select the **Receive** action, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    The 40 loudspeakers are now registered as put away in bin S-01-0001, and a positive item ledger entry is created reflecting the posted purchase receipt.

# Set Up Bin Types

You can direct the flow of items through bins that you have defined for particular warehouse activities. You give each bin its basic flow activities, and thereby define the way a bin is used, by assigning it a bin type.  

There are six types. You can operate your warehouse with all of the six possible bin types, or you can choose to operate with just the RECEIVE, PUTPICK, SHIP and QC bin types. These four bin types enable suggestions to be made that support the flow of items and allow you to record inventory discrepancies.  

## To set up the bin types you want to use

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bin Types**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Bin Types** page, create a 10-character code for a bin type.  
3.  Select the activities that can be performed with each bin type.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Bin types are only applicable if you are using directed put-away and pick for your location.  

The bin type determines only how a bin is used when processing the flow of items through the warehouse. You can always override the suggestions for any warehouse document, and you can move items in or out of any bin by performing a warehouse movement.  

The bin types that you can create are listed below.  

|Bin Type|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|RECEIVE|Items registered as posted receipts but not yet put away.|  
|SHIP|Items picked for warehouse shipment lines but not yet posted as shipped.|  
|PUT AWAY|Typically, items to be stored in large units of measure but that you do not want to access for picking purposes. Because these bins are not used for picking, either for production orders or shipments, your use of a Put Away type bin might be limited, but this bin type could be useful if you have purchased a large quantity of items. Bins of this type should always have a low bin-ranking, so that when received items are put away, other higher-ranking PUTPICK bins fixed to the item are put away first. If you are using this type of bin, you must regularly perform bin replenishment so that the items stored in these bins are also available in PUTPICK or PICK type bins.|  
|PICK|Items to be used only for picking, for example, for items with an approaching expiration date that you have moved into this type of bin. You would place a high bin ranking on these bins so they are suggested for picking first.|  
|PUTPICK|Items in bins that are suggested for both the put-away and pick functions. Bins of this type probably have different bin rankings. You can set up your bulk storage bins as this type of bin with low bin rankings compared to your ordinary pick bins or forward picking area bins.|  
|QC|This bin is used for inventory adjustments if you specify this bin on the location card in the **Adjustment Bin Code** field. You can also set up bins of this type for defective items and items being inspected. You can move items to this type of bin if you want to make them inaccessible to the usual item flow.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** Unlike all other bin types, the **QC** bin type has none of the item handling check boxes selected by default. This indicates that any content you place in a QC bin is excluded from item flows.|

# Release and reopen sales and purchase documents

In this article, you learn how to release or reopen sales and purchase documents like an order, invoice, and quote. You release sales and purchase documents to move them to the next stage of processing before they're posted. When an order is released, it's included in all availability calculations from the expected receipt date of the items.

## Release a sales or purchase document

1. Open the document that you want to release as follows:

   1. In the upper right, select the ![Shows the question mark icon that opens the search box.](media/ui-search/search_small.png) icon to open the search box.
   1. Enter the document type you're looking for, such as **Sales orders** or **Purchase orders**, then choose the related link.
   1. In the list, select the document to open it.
1. In the action bar at the top, select **Release**.

   The **Status** field changes to **Released**.

## Reopen a sales or purchase document

You can make changes to a released sales and purchase document by reopening it.

1. Open the document that you want to reopen as follows:

   1. In the upper right, select the ![Shows the question mark icon that opens the search box.](media/ui-search/search_small.png) icon to open the search box.
   1. Enter the document type you're looking for, such as **Sales orders** or **Purchase orders**, then choose the related link.
   1. In the list, select the document to open it.
1. In the action bar at the top, select **Reopen**.

   The **Status** field changes to **Open**.

You can now make changes to the document before you release it again.

> [!NOTE]
> On document lines that have already been handled in the warehouse, the only change you can make is to change the quantity.

# Power BI Inventory Valuation app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Power BI Inventory Valuation app pulls data from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to provide business leaders key information about inventory across their organization. The app has various reports that offer insights into costing areas. The report can help you make informed decisions and ensure you account for costs.

## Inventory valuation analytics for leadership teams

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Executive Officer
- Chief Operations Officer
- Chief Finance Officer

### Example scenario: maintaining stock costs

Chief executives want to identify locations that hold the most stock value. The [Inventory Valuation by Location](inventory-valuation-powerbi-inventory-valuation-by-location.md) report can help you find that location. You can also break down this data by using the [Inventory Valuation by Item](inventory-valuation-powerbi-inventory-valuation-by-item.md) report to explore the value of each item you have on hand.

## How to use the reports in the Power BI Inventory Valuation app

The following table describes on how you can use each report in the app.

# Assign permissions to users and groups

In combination with the user's license, the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] security system controls user access to objects in each database or environment. For each user, you can specify whether they're able to read, modify, or enter data in database objects. To learn more, go to [Data Security](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/data-security?tabs=object-level) in the developer and administration content for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

Before you assign permissions to users and groups, you must define who can sign in by creating users according to their license. To learn more, go to [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], there are two levels of permissions to database objects:

- Overall permissions according to the license, also referred to as the entitlement.

  The licenses include default permission sets. Admins can customize these default permissions for the relevant license types. To learn more, go to [Configure permissions based on licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md#licensespermissions).  

- Detailed permissions that you assign in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

This article describes how to define, use, and apply permissions in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to change the default configuration.  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online includes default user groups that are assigned to users automatically based on their license. You can change the default configuration by modifying or adding security groups, permission sets, and permissions. The following table outlines key scenarios for modifying the default permissions.  

|To...  |Go to...  |
|---------|---------|
|Make it easier to manage permissions for multiple users, you can organize them in security groups and then assign or change one permission set for many users in one action.| [Control access to Business Central using security groups](ui-security-groups.md) or [Manage permissions through user groups (legacy)](ui-legacy-user-groups.md) |

> [!NOTE]
> A broader way to define which features users have access to is by setting the **Experience** field on the **Company Information** page. To learn more, go to [Change Which Features are Displayed](ui-experiences.md).
>
> You can also define the features that are available to users in the user interface and how they interact with them through pages. You define features through profiles that you assign to different types of users according to their job role or department. To learn more, go to [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md) and [Customizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](ui-customizing-overview.md).

## Create a permission set

> [!NOTE]
> Rather than adding permissions individually, you can add entire permission sets. If needed, you can then exclude individual permissions in them. To learn more, go to [To add other permission sets](#to-add-other-permission-sets). To make that possible, we replaced the Permission Set page with a new one. The key differences are the new **Permission Sets** and **Results** panes, and the **Included permissions** FactBox. To continue using the replaced Permissions page, on the **Permission Sets** page, choose the **Permissions (legacy)** action.

When you add a system permission, your user-defined permission set is automatically updated with any changes that Microsoft makes to those permissions.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Permission Sets**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the **New** action.
1. On the new line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
1. Choose the **Permissions** action.
1. On the **Permission Set** page, in the **Type** field, include or exclude permissions to the object as follows:

   To include the permission, choose **Include**, and then choose level of access to give in the **Read Permission**, **Insert Permission**, **Modify Permission**, **Delete Permission**, and **Execute Permission** fields. The following table describes the options.

   |Option|Description|Ranking|
   |------|-----------|-------|
   |**Blank**|The user can't perform the action on the object.|Lowest|  
   |**Yes**|The user can perform the action on the object.|Highest|
   |**Indirect**|The user can perform the action on the object, but only through another related object that the user has full access to. For more information, see [Example - Indirect Permission](#example---indirect-permission) in this article, and [Permissions Property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-permissions-property#example---indirect-permission) in Developer and IT-Pro Help.|Second highest|
  
   To exclude the permission, or one or more access levels, choose **Exclude**, and then choose the level of access to give. The following table describes the options.

   |Option|Description|
   |------|-----------|
   |**Blank**|Use the access level based on the hierarchy of permissions in the set.  |
   |**Exclude**|Remove the specific access level for the object.|
   |**Reduce to indirect**|Change the access level to Indirect if any permission sets give Direct access to the object. For example, choose this option if the permission set gives Direct access to G/L entries but you don't want users to have full access to the entries.|
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > If a permission is in both an included and excluded permission set, the permission is excluded.

1. Use the **Object Type** and **Object ID** fields to specify the object you're giving access to.

   > [!TIP]
   > New lines show default values. For example, the **Object Type** field contains **Table Data**, and the **Object ID** field contains **0**. The default values are just placeholders, and aren't used. You must choose a type of object and an object in the **Object ID** field before you can create another new line.

1. Optional: If you're defining permissions for a Table Data object type, in the **Security Filter** field you can filter the data that a user can access in fields on the selected table. For example, you might want to let a user access only records that contain information about a particular customer. To learn more, go to [Security filters limit a user's access to specific records in a table](#security-filters-limit-a-users-access-to-specific-records-in-a-table) and [Using Security Filters](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/security-filters).
1. Optional: On the **Permission Sets** pane, add one or more other permission sets. To learn more, go to [To add other permission sets](#to-add-other-permission-sets).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use caution when assigning **Insert Permission** or **Modify Permission** to the **9001 User Group Member** or **9003 User Group Permission Set** table. Any users assigned to the permission set could potentially assign themselves to other user groups, which in turn might give them unintended permissions.

### Example - Indirect Permission

You can assign Indirect permission to allow a user to use an object, but only through another object. For example, a user has permission to run codeunit 80, Sales-Post. The Sales-Post codeunit performs many tasks, including modifying table 37, Sales Line. When the user posts a sales document using the Sales-Post codeunit, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks whether the user has permission to modify the Sales Line table. If not, the codeunit can't complete its tasks, and the user receives an error message. If so, the codeunit runs successfully.

However, the user doesn't need to have full access to the Sales Line table to run the codeunit. If the user has Indirect permission for the Sales Line table, the Sales-Post codeunit runs successfully. When a user has Indirect permission, they can only modify the Sales Line table by running the Sales-Post codeunit or another object that has permission to modify the Sales Line table. The user can only modify the Sales Line table when doing so from supported application areas. The user can't run the feature inadvertently or maliciously by other methods.

### To add other permission sets

Expand a permission set by adding other permission sets to it. Afterward, you can include or exclude specific permissions, or entire permission sets, in each set you add. This setting includes permissions in the Extension and System type permission sets, which otherwise isn't allowed. Exclusions apply only to the permission set you're expanding. The original set isn't affected.

On the **Permission Set** page, add a permission set on the **Permission Sets** pane. The **Result** pane lists all added permission sets. To explore the permissions that are included in a set you added, choose the set on the Result pane so the **Included permissions** FactBox shows the permissions.

On the **Result** pane, use the **Inclusion Status** field to identify the permission sets in which you excluded permissions or permission sets. If something's excluded, the status is **Partial**.

For an overall view of permissions in the permission set, choose the **View all permissions** action. The **Expanded Permissions** page shows all permissions that were already assigned to the permission set and the permissions in the added permission sets.

To fully exclude all permissions from a permission set, on the **Result** pane, select the line, choose **Show more options**, and then choose **Exclude**. When you exclude a permission set, a line is created on the **Permission Sets** pane of the type Excluded. If you excluded a permission set, but want to include it again, delete the line on the **Permission Sets** pane.

To fully or partially exclude a specific permission in a set you added, under **Permissions**, create a line for the object. The access level fields, such as **Insert Permission**, **Modify Permission**, and so on, all contain **Exclude**. To allow a certain access level, choose the appropriate option.

Excluding a permission set excludes all of the permissions in the set. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates permissions as follows:

1. Calculate the full list of included permissions
1. Calculate the full list of excluded permissions
1. Remove excluded permissions from the list of included permissions (removing an indirect permission is the same as Reduce to Indirect)

## Copy a permission set

Create a new permission set by copying another. The new set includes all of the permissions and permission sets from the set you copied. How the permissions and permission sets are arranged in the new permission set differs, depending on your choice in the **Copy operation** field. The following table describes the options.

|Option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Copy by reference**     | The original permission set and all of the permission sets that were added to it are listed on the **Results** pane.       |
|**Flat permission copy**  | All permissions from all permission sets are included in a flat list on the **Permissions pane**. Permissions aren't organized by permission set.        |
|**Clone**     | Create an exact copy of the original permission set.        |

1. On the **Permission Sets** page, select the line for a permission set that you want to copy, and then choose the **Copy Permission Set** action.
1. On the **Copy Permission Set** page, specify the name of the new permission set.
1. In the **Copy operation** field, specify how to arrange permission in the new permission set.
1. Optional: If you're adding a System permission set, you might want to be notified if the name or content of the original permission set changes in a future version. This lets you consider whether to update your user-defined permission set. To receive a notification, turn on the **Notify on Changed Permission Set** toggle.

> [!NOTE]
> The notification requires that the **Original System permission set changed** notification is enabled on the **My Notifications** page.

## Create or modify permissions by recording your actions

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Permission Sets**, and then choose the related link.

   Alternatively, on the **Users** page, choose the **Permission Sets** action.
1. On the **Permission Sets** page, choose the **New** Action.
1. On a new line, fill in the fields as necessary.
1. Choose the **Permissions** action.
1. On the **Permissions** page, choose the **Record Permissions** action, and then choose the **Start** action.

   Recording must be done either by using the **Open this page in a new windows** (pop-out) feature to have the **Permissions** recording window side-by-side, or by working within the same tab.  
    A recording process now starts and captures all of your actions in the user interface.
1. Go to the various pages and activities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that you want users with this permission set to access. You must carry out the tasks that you want to record permissions for.
1. When you want to finish the recording, return to the **Permissions** page, and then choose the **Stop** action.
1. Choose the **Yes** button to add the recorded permissions to the new permission set.
1. For each object in the recorded list, specify whether users are able to insert, modify, or delete records in the recorded tables.

### To export and import a permission set

To quickly set up permissions, you can import permission sets that you exported from another [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant.

In multitenant environments, a permission set is imported into a specific tenant. In other words, the scope of the import is *Tenant*.

1. In tenant 1, on the **Permission Sets** page, select the line or lines for the permission sets to export, and then choose the **Export Permission Sets** action.

   An XML file is created in the download folder on your machine. By default, the name is *Export Permission Sets.xml*.

1. In tenant 2, on the **Permission Sets** page, select the **Import Permission Sets** action.
1. On the **Import Permission Sets** dialog page, consider if you want to merge existing permission sets with any new permission sets in the XML file.

   If you select the **Update existing permissions** checkbox, existing permission sets that match names in the XML file merge with the imported permission sets.

   If you don't select the **Update existing permissions** checkbox, permission sets that match names in the XML file are skipped during import. In that case, you're notified about the permission sets that are skipped.

1. From the **Import** dialog page, find and select the XML file to be imported, and then choose the **Open** action.

The permission sets are imported.

## Remove obsolete permissions from all permission sets

On the **Permission Sets** page, choose the **Remove Obsolete Permissions** action.

## Set up time constraints for users

Administrators can define periods of time during which specified users are able to post. Administrators can also specify if the system logs how much time users are signed in. Similarly, administrators can assign responsibility centers to users. To learn more, go to [Work with Responsibility Centers](inventory-responsibility-centers.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. On the **User Setup** page opens, choose the **New** action.
1. In the **User ID** field, enter the ID of a user, or choose the field to see all current Windows users in the system.
1. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## Control access to specific companies

When you have multiple companies in Business Central, managing permissions across companies requires extra consideration. You might not want users to have identical access rights to all companies. Instead, you might need to grant users' permissions based on their company affiliations. When you assign permission sets to individual users or security groups, you can select a specific company to which the permission set applies. The company isn't explicitly specified within the permission set, but rather when the permission set is assigned to the user or security group.

If you don't specify the company when assigning a permission set, the permission set then applies to all companies. If you want a permission set to apply to more than one company, but not all companies, add the permission set specifically for each company separately.

To learn how, go to [Assign permission sets to users](#assign-permission-sets-to-users) or [Assign permissions to a security group](ui-security-groups.md#assign-permissions-to-a-security-group).

## Review the permissions in a security group

On the **Security Groups** page, the FactBox pane shows the **Permission Sets** that are assigned to the group. Each user listed in the **Members** card has those permissions. The **Permission Set by Security Group** action provides a more detailed view. There you can also explore the individual permissions in each security group.

Permissions are also available on the **Users** page. The FactBox pane shows the **Permission Sets from Security Group** and **Security Group Memberships** cards for the selected user.

## Assign permission sets to users

A permission set is a collection of permissions for specific database objects. All users must be assigned one or more permission sets before they can access [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

A [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] solution contains predefined permission sets that Microsoft or your solution provider add. You can also add new permission sets tailored to meet the needs of your organization. To learn more, go to [Create a permission set](#create-a-permission-set).

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't want to restrict a user's access more than already defined by the license, you can assign a special permission set called **SUPER** to the user. This permission set ensures that the user can access all objects specified in the license.
>
> A user with the Essential license and the SUPER permission set has access to more functionality than users with the Team Member license and the SUPER permission set.

You can assign permissions sets to users in two ways:

- From the **User Card** page, by selecting permission sets to assign to the user.
- From the **Permission Set by User** page, by selecting users that a permission set is assigned to.

### To assign a permission set on a user card

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
1. Select the user that you want to assign permission to.

   Any permission sets that are already assigned to the user are displayed in the **Permission Sets** FactBox.
1. Choose the **Edit** action to open the **User Card** page.
1. On the **User Permission Sets** FastTab, on a new line, fill in the fields as necessary. To learn more, go to [Create or edit a permission set](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#create-a-permission-set).

   If you want the permission set to apply to a specific company, select the company in the **Company** field. If you want the permission set to apply to all companies, leave the **Company** field blank. [Learn more](#control-access-to-specific-companies).

## To assign a permission set on the Permission Set by User page

This method makes it easier for you to assign different permission sets to multiple users. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
1. On the **Users** page, choose the **Permission Set by User** action.
1. If you want the permission sets to apply only to a specific company, set the **Company name** field to that company. If you want the permission set to apply to all companies, leave the **Company name** field blank. [Learn more](#control-access-to-specific-companies).
1. On the **Permission Set by User** page, select the **[user name]** checkbox on a line for the relevant permission set to assign the set to the user.

    Select the **All Users** checkbox to assign the permission set to all users.

## Get an overview of a user's permissions

You can view other users' effective permissions only if you're assigned to the SECURITY or SUPER permissions. 

The **Effective Permissions** page offers additional information about the source of each permission. For example, whether the source is a security group, or a permission is inherited. The page also contains a column where administrators can review the security filters that are applied. To learn more about security filters, go to [Security filters limit a user's access to specific records in a table](#security-filters-limit-a-users-access-to-specific-records-in-a-table).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
1. Open the card of the relevant user.
1. Choose the **Effective Permissions** action.

   The **Permissions** part lists all the database objects that the user has access to. You can't edit this section.

   The **By Permission Set** part shows the assigned permission sets through which the permissions are granted to the user, the source and type of the permission set, and to which extent the different access types are permitted.

   For each row that you select in the **Permissions** section, the **By Permission Set** section shows which permission set or sets that the permission is granted through. In this section, you can edit the value in each of the five access type fields, **Read Permission**, **Insert Permission**, **Modify Permission**, **Delete Permission**, **Execute Permission**.

   > [!NOTE]  
   > Only permission sets of type **User-Defined** can be edited.
   >
   > Rows of source Entitlement originate from the subscription license. The permission values of the entitlement overrule values in other permission sets if they have a higher ranking. A value in a nonentitlement permission set that has a higher ranking than the related value in the entitlement is surrounded by brackets. The brackets indicate that it isn't effective because the entitlement overrules it.
   >
   > To learn more about ranking, go to [Create a permission set](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#create-a-permission-set).  

1. To edit a permission set, in the **By Permission Set** part, on the line for a relevant permission set of type **User-Defined**, choose one of the five access type fields and select a different value.
1. To edit individual permissions within the permission set, choose the value in the **Permission Set** field to open the **Permissions** page.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you edit a permission set, the changes also apply to other users that have the permission set.

### Security filters limit a user's access to specific records in a table

For record-level security in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], use security filters to limit a user's access to data in a table. You create security filters on table data. A security filter describes a set of records in a table that a user has permission to access. You can specify, for example, that a user can only read the records that contain information about a particular customer. In this way, the user can't access the records that contain information about other customers. To learn more, go to [Using Security Filters](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/security-filters) in the administration content.

## View permission changes telemetry

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to send changes that are done to permission to an Application Insights resource in Microsoft Azure. Then, using Azure Monitor, you create reports and set up alerts on the gathered data. To learn more, go to the following articles in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Developer and admin help:

- [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry - Enabling Application Insights](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview#enable)

# Create users according to licenses

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

This article describes how administrators create users and define who can sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This article also describes how to assign permissions to different users according to your product licenses.

## Basics

- When you create users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you grant permissions to them through permission sets. 
- You can also organize users in security groups. Security groups make it easier to manage permissions and other settings for multiple users at the same time.
  [!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-short](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-short.md)]
- There are several license types. Learn about the different types of licenses and how licensing works in the [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).

- The process of managing users and licenses varies depending on whether [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is deployed online or on-premises. For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you must add users from Microsoft 365. In on-premises deployments, you can create, edit, and delete users directly.  

## Manage users and licenses in online tenants

User accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online must be first created in the Microsoft 365 admin center. These user accounts aren't exclusive to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you subscribe to other plans, they can be used to sign in to other applications, such as Power BI. For information about creating users in the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to [Add users in Microsoft admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users).

Your subscription to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online defines how many [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user licenses you're allowed. Users are added to your tenant in the Microsoft Partner Center, typically by your Microsoft partner. For more information, see [Administration of Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration).

You assign licenses to users according to the work each user does in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can assign licenses in several ways:

- Your company's Microsoft 365 administrator can do it in the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com). For more information, see [Add users individually or in bulk to Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users).  
- A Microsoft partner can assign licenses in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center or in the Microsoft Partner Center. For more information, see [User management tasks for customer accounts](/partner-center/assign-licenses-to-users) in the Microsoft Partner Center Help.

For more information, see [Administration of Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration) in the administration Help.

After user accounts are created in the Microsoft 365 admin center, there are two ways to import them to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- A user account is imported automatically when the user signs in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] the first time.

   > [!NOTE]
   > After a user signs in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can't delete the user.

- The administrator can import users by choosing the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action on the **Users* page.

Both approaches have their own advantages, and you can use them simultaneously. Each approach allows administrators to proactively configure [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to assign the starting permissions, user groups, and user profiles. Using the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action gives administrators more control to adjust permissions, user groups, and profiles. It's an ideal approach when you're setting up [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] the first time, before any users sign in, or when adding a new team of users.

> [!NOTE]
> After you add users in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, we recommend that you update the user information in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as soon as possible. Keeping user information current is easy to do, and helps ensure that people can always sign in. For more information, see [To add users or update user information and license assignments in Business Central](#adduser).<br>
>
> Updating user information is especially important if you've customized permission sets for the license. If a new user tries to sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] before you've added them, they might not be able to. For more information, see [Configure permissions based on licenses](#licensespermissions).
>
> However, users who experience this problem aren't actually blocked. They can either use the **Go back home** action, or simply sign in again to resolve the issue.

### Delegated admin users

[!INCLUDE [admin-gdap-users](includes/admin-gdap-users.md)]

### <a name="licensespermissions"></a>Configure permissions based on licenses

[!INCLUDE [2022_releasewave1](includes/2022_releasewave1.md)]

Admins can configure permissions sets and user groups for each license.<!--Note to translators: The names in *italics* or capitalized in this section must not be translated.-->  

For example, the commonly used license, *Dynamics 365 Business Central Team Member*, has the following permissions sets by default:

- D365 READ
- D365 TEAM MEMBER
- EDIT IN EXCEL - VIEW
- EXPORT REPORT EXCEL
- LOCAL

Other permission sets are added automatically based on the user groups assigned to the license. When you create a new user based on this license, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the permission sets originating from the user groups and the permission sets from the license. The same starting permissions are assigned to the user if their user account was created automatically in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or if the administrator used the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action in the **Users** page.

If this default configuration isn't the right setup for a particular environment, the admin can change that configuration. However, customized permissions affect only new users who are assigned that license. Permissions for existing users who are assigned the license aren't affected.  

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using an administrator account.  
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **License Configuration**, and then choose the related link.  

    <!--Alternatively, if you're already in the **Users** page, you can run the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** guide, and then, on the first page of the guide, choose the **Configure permissions per license** link.-->  
3. In the **License Configuration** page, choose the license that you want to customize, and then choose the **Configure** action.  
4. Choose the **Customize permissions** field to switch on customization, and then make the changes.  

    In our example, the admin wants to remove the permission to edit in Excel, so they remove the *Excel Export Action* user group from the Team Member license. Afterward, new users who are assigned the Team Member license can't export data to Excel. If the organization changes their minds on the subject, they can just go back to the **License Configuration** page and switch off the customization for that license type.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This customization of permissions only takes effect for new users that you assign the relevant license. Existing users are not updated. We recommend that you customize permissions before you start assigning users licenses in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

### <a name="adduser"></a>To add users or update user information and license assignments in Business Central

After you add users or change user information in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, you can quickly import the user information to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The import includes license assignments.  

> [!TIP]
> If you need to update user information and you have a lot of users, you can use the filter pane to narrow down the list. You can filter on basic information such as the user name, or set more technical filters, such as the user's security ID.

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using an administrator account.
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.  
3. Choose **Update Users from Microsoft 365**.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Running the synchronization of users from Microsoft 365 using the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** guide, requires the SUPER permission set.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Update Users from Microsoft 365** guide doesn't update users that are not assigned a license, such as someone who is a [Dynamics 365 administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#dynamics-365-administrator). Those users will update the next time they sign in to the environment.

The next step for newly created users is to assign user groups and permissions. Go to [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md) for information. If you update a user with a license change, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns users to the appropriate user group and updates their permission sets. For more information, see [To manage permissions through user groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> With 2024 release wave 1, a Premium license user can sign in to a company where the **User Experience** field is set to **Essentials** on the **Company Information** page. However, the Premium user can't use any of the features that the Premium license provides. This doesn't work in the opposite direction. Users who have an Essentials license can't sign in to a company where the **User Experience** is set to **Premium** on the **Company Information** page. For more information about licensing, go to [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central/overview/) website.

If you use an external accountant to manage your books and financial reporting, you can invite them to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so they can work with you on your fiscal data. For more information, see [Inviting Your External Accountant to Your Business Central](finance-accounting.md#inviteaccountant).

For more information about synchronizing user information with Microsoft 365, go to the [Synchronization with Microsoft 365](#m365) section.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use an external accountant to manage your books and financial reporting, you can invite them to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so they can work with you on your fiscal data. For more information, see [Inviting Your External Accountant to Your Business Central](finance-accounting.md#inviteaccountant).

### To remove a user's access to the system

You can remove a user's access to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. All references to the user are kept. However, the user can't sign in and active sessions for the user are stopped.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the **User Card** page for the relevant user, and then, in the **Status** field, select **Disabled**.
3. To give the user access again, set the **Status** field to **Enabled**.

You can also remove the license from a user in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. The user is then unable to sign in. For more information, see [Remove licenses from users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/remove-licenses-from-users).

### <a name="m365"></a>Synchronization with Microsoft 365

When you assign a license for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to a user in Microsoft 365, there are two ways to create the user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

- The administrator can add the user by choosing the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action on the **Users** page as described in the [To add a user or update user information in Business Central](#adduser) section.
- The license information updates automatically when the user signs in for the first time.

In both cases, several settings are applied automatically. These settings are listed in the second and third columns in the following table.

If you change user information in Microsoft 365, you can update [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to reflect the change. Depending on what you want to update, use one of the actions on the **Users** page. The actions are described in the last two columns in the following table.

|What happens when:|First user, first sign-in|Update Users from Microsoft 365|Restore User Default User Groups|
|-|-|-|-|
|Scope:|Current user|Multiple selected users|Single selected user (except current)|
|Create the new user and assign SUPER permission set.<br /><br /><!--Platform-->|**X**|**X** | | 
|Update the user based on information in Microsoft 365: Status, Full Name, Contact Email, Authentication Email.<!--<br /><br />Codeunit "Azure AD   Graph User".UpdateUserFromAzureGraph-->|**X**|**X**|**X**|
|Synchronize user plans (licenses) with licenses and roles assigned in Microsoft 365.<!--<br /><br />Codeunit "Azure AD   Graph User".UpdateUserPlans-->|**X**|**X**|**X**|
|Add the user to user groups according to the current user plans. Remove the SUPER permission set for all users other than the first user to sign in and [administrators](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration). At least one SUPER is required.<!--<br /><br />Codeunit "Permission Manager". AddUserToDefaultUserGroups-->|**X**|**X**|**X**<br /><br />Removes manually assigned user groups and permissions.|

Users can access [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records in Teams using only their Microsoft 365 license. When access is enabled for an environment, synchronizing using the **Update users from Microsoft 365** action skips users that only have a Microsoft 365 license. To include these users in synchronization, you must first update environment settings by assigning a security group that contains users with a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license and users with only a Microsoft 365 license.

Learn about securing access to environments using security groups at [Manage access using Microsoft Entra groups](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access#manage-access-using-azure-active-directory-groups).

Get an overview of accessing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Teams with Microsoft 365 licenses at [admin-access-with-m365-license](admin-access-with-m365-license.md).

## Manage users and licenses in on-premises deployments

For on-premises deployments, the number of user licenses is specified in the license file (.bclicense or .flf). When an administrator or Microsoft partner uploads the license file, they can specify which users can sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

For on-premises deployments, the administrator creates, edits, and deletes users directly from the **Users** page.

> [!NOTE]
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, delegated admin access isn't available like it is in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. Microsoft partners need standard user licenses to use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more about licenses in the [Business Central on-premises licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2009643).

### To edit or delete a user in an on-premises deployment

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the user that you want to edit, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **User Card** page, change the information as necessary.  
4. To delete a user, select the user that you want to delete, and then choose the **Delete** action.

> [!NOTE]
> For on-premises deployments an administrator can specify how to authenticate user credentials in the [!INCLUDE[server](includes/server.md)] instance. When you create a user, you provide the credential type that you are using.
>

## Analyze user status by license type

You can use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze data on the [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) page. You don't have to run a report or open another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Users by status" or "Users by license type," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

### User analysis scenarios

The following sections provide examples of scenarios where analyzing the user list can help you monitor the status of your users.

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [Users by status](#example-users-by-status) | See a list of users based on their status (enabled/disabled). | [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) | **Status**, **User Name**, **Full Name**, **Authorization email**, and **License Type**. |
| [Users by license type](#example-users-by-license-type) | See a list of users based on their license type. | [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) | **License Type**, **Status**,  **User Name**, **Full Name**, and **Authorization email**. |

### Example: Users by status

To analyze users by status, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) list, and choose the :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: icon to turn on analysis mode.
1. On the **Columns** menu, remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Status** (user enabled/disabled) and **License Type** fields to the **Row Groups** area.
1. Choose the fields **User Name**, **Full Name**, and **Authorization email**.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Users by status**, or something that describes this analysis.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

# Set up the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)]

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

This article explains how to set up the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)] in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

For the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)] to show correct KPIs and reports, do two things in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

1. Set up G/L account categories for your chart of accounts.
1. Map G/L account categories to corresponding categories used in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Finance semantic model.

## Prerequisites

Before you configure the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)] for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must:

1. Have a connector (AL) app that contains APIs, setup pages, and embed pages. Connectors are preinstalled with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
1. Install the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template app that contains a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] semantic model and [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports for finance.
1. Run the **Connect to Power BI** assisted setup guide.

To learn more, go to [Install Power BI apps for Business Central](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md).

## Configure date filtering for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)] semantic model

This section describes how to configure date filtering for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)]. You can configure the app to load data based on the **Start Date** and **End Date**. This filter helps improve performance in your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment and reduce [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] load times by only loading the data you intend to analyze.

> [!NOTE]
> Configuring date filtering for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)] is optional, and is designed to help manage large datasets.

The **Start Date** and **End Date** filter can apply to the following tables:

- G/L Entries (related to the Income Statement)
- G/L Budget Entries
- Customer Ledger Entries
- Vendor Ledger Entries

### Set up date filtering

1. Search and open the **[Power BI Connector Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=36951)** page.
1. Expand the **Finance Report** section.
1. Fill in the **Start Date** and **End Date** fields under **Income Statement & G/L Budget Entry Filters**.

Repeat steps 2-3 for the date setup under **Customer Ledger Entry Filters** and **Vendor Ledger Entry Filters**.

The following fields are available on the **Finance Report** FastTab:

|No.| Data Area | Field Name | Description |
|---| ---       | ---        | ---         |
|1  | Income Statement and G/L Budgets   | Start Date      | Specifies the starting date to apply to a range of income statement G/L entries and G/L budget entries.   |
|2  | Income Statement and G/L Budgets   | End Date        | Specifies the end date to apply to a range of income statement G/L entries and G/L budget entries.        |
|3  | Customer Ledger Entries            | Start Date      | Specifies the starting date to apply to a range of customer ledger entries.                               |  
|4  | Customer Ledger Entries            | End Date        | Specifies the end date to apply to a range of customer ledger entries.                                    |
|5  | Vendor Ledger Entries            | Start Date      | Specifies the starting date to apply to a range of vendor ledger entries.                                 |
|6  | Vendor Ledger Entries            | End Date        | Specifies the end date to apply to a range of vendor ledger entries.                                      |

## Set up G/L account categories for your chart of accounts

G/L account categories are groups of general ledger accounts. The categories are required for using the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Finance app.

For each posting account in your chart of accounts, you must specify an **Account Category** and **Account Subcategory**. You don't need to set up the totaling accounts.

To learn more about how to work with G/L account categories, go to [G/L account categories](./finance-general-ledger.md#account-categories).

## Map G/L account categories to corresponding categories used in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Finance semantic model

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Finance app has default mappings for G/L account categories in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to corresponding values in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Finance semantic model. This mapping enables the finance KPIs and reports to show correct values.

The following sections show the default mappings. You can change the default values of the **Business Central Category** columns to your choice of G/L account categories by choosing the **Power BI Account Categories** action on the **Power BI Connector Setup** setup page or directly on the **Power BI Account Categories** page.

### Level 1 Categories

Level 1 categories are the top-level categories without indentation.

| Power BI Account Category                 | Business Central Category |
| ---                                       | ---                       |
| Assets (Level 1 Category)                 | Assets                    |
| Liabilities (Level 1 Category)            | Liabilities               |
| Equity (Level 1 Category)                 | Equity                    |
| Revenue (Level 1 Category)                | Income                    |

| Expense (Level 1 Category)                | Expense                   |

### Level 2 Categories

Level 2 categories are the second-level categories with indentation.

| Power BI Account Category	| Business Central Category     |
|---                    |---                              |
| Current Assets (Level 2 Category) | Current Assets   |
| Current Liabilities (Level 2 Category)  | Current Liabilities   |
| Shareholder's Equity (Level 2 Category) | Common Stock          |
| Interest Expense (Level 2 Category)     | Interest Expense      |
| Tax Expense (Level 2 Category)          | Tax Expense            |
| Extraordinary Expense (Level 2 Category) | Extraordinary Expense |
| FX Losses Expense (Level 2 Category)     | FX Losses Expense  |
| Depreciation and Amortization (Level 2 Category) 	| Depreciation and Amortization     |
| Interest Revenue (Level 2 Category)  | Interest Income        |
| FX Gains Revenue (Level 2 Category)  | FX Gains Income         |
| Extraordinary Revenue (Level 2 Category) | Extraordinary Income   |
| Fixed Assets (Level 2 Category)          | Fixed Assets           |
| Payroll Liabilities (Level 2 Category)   | Payroll Liabilities     |
| Long-term Liabilities (Level 2 Category)  | Long Term Liabilities   |

### Level 3 Categories

Level 3 categories are the subcategories of Level 2 with indentation.

| Power BI Account Category                 | Business Central Category |
| ---                                       | ---                       |
| Inventory (Level 3 Category)              | Inventory                 |
| Accounts Payable (Level 3 Category)       | Accounts Payable          |
| Accounts Receivable (Level 3 Category)    | Accounts Receivable       |
| Purchases (Level 3 Category)              | Purchases                 |
| Purchase Prepayments (Level 3 Category)   | Prepaid Expenses          |
| Liquid Assets (Level 3 Category)          | Cash                      |

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues with the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)], the information in the following sections might help you get unblocked.

### Getting the "[Unable to combine data] Section1/G\/L Entries/Combine Queries references other queries or steps, so it may not directly access a data source. Please rebuild this data combination." error?

When you install the Power BI app for Finance, make sure that you set the **Privacy level setting for this data source** field to **Organizational** when you authenticate.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/power-bi-install-app-authenticate.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Power BI app installer." lightbox="media/powerbi/power-bi-install-app-authenticate.png":::

### Getting the "Column Entry No. in Table G/L Entries contains a duplicate value" error?

When you refresh data from your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment into the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)], a refresh error might happen with the following error message:

```
Something went wrong
There was an error when processing the data in the dataset.
Please try again later or contact support. If you contact support, please provide these details.

Data source error: Column '<oii>Entry No.</oii>' in Table '<oii>G/L Entries</oii>' contains a duplicate value
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you get this error, you're affected by a bug in the semantic model for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)].

This error indicates that there are duplicate G/L entries in the Finance fact table in the semantic model. The error displays when we attempt to combine the three sub-queries (Balance Sheet G/L Entries, Income Statement G/L Entries, and Close Income Statement G/L Entries) into the single G/L Entries Fact table.

The current Balance Sheet G/L Entries query has a hard-coded filter transformation. This filter assumes that the source code for closing entries is CLSINCOME. This leads the model to allow closing entries to exist in both the Balance Sheet query and the Closing Entries query, resulting in duplicate entries.

### Getting the "Column ‘G/L Account No.’ in Table ‘G/L Account’ contains a duplicate value" error?

When you refresh data from your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment into the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)], a refresh error might happen due to how your **Begin-Total** and **End-Total** accounts are configured in your **Chart of Accounts**.

If you receive this error, review the totaling accounts.

```
Something went wrong
There was an error when processing the data in the dataset.
Please try again later or contact support. If you contact support, please provide these details.

Data source error: Column 'G/L Account No.' in Table 'G/L Account' contains a duplicate value 'X' and this is not allowed for columns on the one side of a many-to-one relationship or for columns that are used as the primary key of a table.
```

**Why did this happen?**

This error can happen because the Finance Connector app relies on the totaling accounts for hierarchy and indentation purposes.

Your totaling for an **End-Total** account must exactly reference both the **Begin-Total** and **End-Total** accounts. You can only use one **Begin-Total** account in one **End-Total** account.

**Fix the totaling on your G/L Accounts**

The following example shows how to set up the totaling accounts.

1. A **Begin-Total** account of **1300 (Vehicles)** and the **End-Total** account of **1390 (Vehicles, Total)**.
2. The totaling defined for the **End-Total** is **1300..1390**. Any other combination for your totaling account (such as 1300..1340, 1310..1390, or 1310..1340, etc.) can cause the error.
3. One **Begin-Total** account can only be used in one **End-Total** account. If you use a **Begin-Total** account in two or more **End-Total** accounts, the [!INCLUDE [power-bi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)] can't match it to an **End-Total** account.

# Set up unrealized VAT for cash-based accounting

If you're using cash-based accounting methods, you can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to handle unrealized VAT.

## To use general ledger accounts for unrealized VAT

You can choose to have VAT amounts calculated and posted to a temporary general ledger account when an invoice is posted, and then posted to the correct general ledger account and included in VAT statements when the actual payment of the invoice is posted. Before you can do this, you must complete the [VAT posting setup](finance-setup-vat.md).

To use accounts for unrealized VAT, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, and enter **General Ledger Setup**.
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, select the **Unrealized VAT** check box.
3. Choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), and enter **VAT Posting Setup**.
4. On the **VAT Posting Setup** page, choose the VAT posting group, and then choose the **Edit** action.
5. In the **Unrealized VAT Type** field, choose an option to specify how to allocate payments to the invoice amount (excluding VAT) and the VAT amount itself, and how to transfer VAT amounts from the unrealized VAT account to the realized account. The following table describes the options.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Blank | Choose this option if you don't want to use the unrealized VAT feature. |
| Percentage | Payments cover both VAT and the invoice amount in proportion to the payment's percentage of the remaining invoice amount. The paid VAT amount is transferred from the unrealized VAT account to the realized VAT account. |
| First | Payments cover VAT first and then invoice amounts. In this case, the amount transferred from the unrealized VAT account to the VAT account will equal the amount of the payment until the total VAT has been paid. |
| Last | Payments cover the invoice amount first and then VAT. In this case, no amount will be transferred from the unrealized VAT account to the VAT account until the total amount of the invoice, excluding VAT, has been paid. |
| First (Fully Paid) | Payments will cover VAT first (like the _First_ option), but no amount will be transferred to the VAT account until the full amount of VAT has been paid. |
| Last (Fully Paid) | Payments will cover invoice amount first (like the _Last_ option), but no amount will be transferred to the VAT account until the full amount of VAT has been paid. |

6. In the **Sales VAT Unreal. Account** field, choose the account for unrealized sales VAT.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The VAT amount will be posted to this account, and stay there until the customer payment is posted. The amount is then transferred to the account for sales VAT.
7. In the **Purch. VAT Unreal. Account** field, enter the general ledger account for unrealized purchase VAT.

> [!NOTE]  
> The VAT amount will be posted to this account, and stay there until the customer payment is posted. The amount is then transferred to the account for purchase VAT.

# Current Utilization (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Current Utilization** report provides insights into the manufacturing capacity use and helps with capacity planning. It shows the capacity available and used by hours and the percentage of use.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/current-utilization-v26.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Current Utilization Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/current-utilization-v26.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for business leaders and manufacturing teams.

COOs use the report to monitor the percentage of use of resources on production lines and ensure efficient allocation. You can analyze the capacity utilization gauges to track the current week's utilization percentage. The analysis can help you make necessary adjustments to meet production deadlines. The report also helps you track the expected capacity need percentage to keep the utilization rate above the required threshold.

Manufacturing managers use the report to understand the capacity of machine and work centers. The report provides insights into the capacity used by hour, allowing you to optimize the use of your machine and work centers. You can use the gauges to track today's utilization percentage and the current week's utilization percentage, and adjust the production schedules accordingly. The report helps you ensure that you complete production orders on time by keeping the utilization rate above the required threshold.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Current Utilization* report includes the following KPIs and measures:

- [Work Center Load](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#work-center-load)
- [Work Center Allocated Time](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#work-center-allocated-time)
- [Work Center Availability After Orders](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#work-center-availability-after-orders)
- [Work Center Capacity (Total)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#work-center-capacity-total)

# Set Up Electronic Document Sending and Receiving

> [!NOTE]
> The content in this article is only applicable for versions of Dynamics 365 Business Central that were released before 2023 release wave 2. In 2023 release wave 2, new functionality for E-Documents is included. To learn more, see [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md). 


As an alternative to emailing as file attachments, you can send and receive business documents electronically. By electronic document is meant a standard\-compliant file representing a business document, such as an invoice from a vendor that can be received and converted to a purchase invoice in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The exchange of electronic documents between two trading partners is performed by an external provider of document exchange services. The generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports sending and receiving electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format, which is supported by the largest providers of document exchange services. A major provider of document exchange services is preconfigured and ready to be set up for your company.  

From PDF or image files representing incoming documents, you can have an external OCR service (Optical Character Recognition) create electronic documents that you can then convert to document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], like for electronic PEPPOL documents. For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can send it to the OCR service from the **Incoming Documents** page. After a few seconds, you receive the file back as an electronic invoice that can be converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor. If you send the file to the OCR service by email, then a new incoming document record is automatically created when you receive the electronic document back.  

The **PEPPOL** electronic document format is preconfigured to enable you to send electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format. First, you must set up various master data, such as company information, customers, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when converting data in fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to elements in the outgoing document file. Last, you must select the format on the **Electronic Document Format** page for each customer who you will send electronic PEPPOL documents to. For more information, see [Send Electronic Documents](sales-how-to-send-electronic-documents.md).  

The **PEPPOL – Invoice** and **PEPPOL – Credit Memo** data exchange definitions are preconfigured to enable you to receive electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format. First, you must set up various master data, such as company information, vendors, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when converting data in elements in the incoming document file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Last, you must select the data exchange definition on the **Incoming Documents** page for each incoming electronic document that you want to convert to a purchase document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The **OCR – Invoice** data exchange definition is preconfigured to enable you to receive electronic documents that are generated by the OCR service. To receive, for example, an invoice as an electronic OCR document, you set up master date and then process the document just as when receiving an electronic PEPPOL document. For more information, see [Use OCR to Turn PDF and Image Files into Electronic Documents](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md).  

The preconfigured services for document exchange and OCR must be enabled before you send or receive. For more information, see [Set Up a Document Exchange Service](across-how-to-set-up-a-document-exchange-service.md).

# Set up nondeductible VAT

Nondeductible value-added tax (VAT) is the VAT that's payable by a purchaser but that isn't deductible from the purchaser's own VAT liability. Companies can usually recover VAT on the purchase of goods and services that are related to their business activities. However, in some situations, a business incurs VAT that isn't deductible. These situations are typically related to the local regulations and can differ among countries/regions. However, the model of using nondeductible or partially deductible VAT is similar. You can use proportional VAT to calculate VAT when there's deductible and nondeductible VAT.

In general, VAT can't be deducted for some purchases because of the following factors:

- **The type of goods or services that are purchased** – VAT is fully or partially nondeductible according to the law about goods such as cars, mobile phones, and food purchased at restaurants.
- **Partially deductible pro-rated VAT** – VAT is pro-rated according to the ratio between the sales operations that VAT is owed for and all performed operations. VAT that exceeds this ratio can't be deducted.

Because it can be difficult to know where and how an item is used, contact the local tax authorities in your country/region. They can help determine whether you can deduct a specified percentage of the VAT, based on historical data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This global feature is available in all countries with enabled VAT **except for Belgium, Italy, and Norway**. These localizations already have existing local feature and will be upgraded in the future. Don't run this feature in these countries because the upgrade procedure doesn't exist.

## Use nondeductible VAT

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the **Enable Non-Deductible VAT** checkbox.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > After you enable non-deductible VAT, you can't turn it off, because the feature might include changes to data and might initiate an upgrade of some database tables. Microsoft strongly recommends that you first enable and test this feature in the sandbox environment before you enable it in the production environment.

3. Configure how the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] treats nondeductible VAT values.

    1. In the **Use For Item Cost** field, specify whether the nondeductible VAT must be added to the item cost when you purchase items. Otherwise, the nondeductible VAT won't influence the item cost and the full amount is recorded only at the general ledger level.
    2. Select the **Use For Fixed Asset Cost** checkbox to add the nondeductible VAT to the fixed asset cost when you purchase new fixed assets. Otherwise, the nondeductible VAT won't influence the fixed asset cost and the full amount is recorded only at the general ledger level.
    3. Select the **Use For Job Cost** checkbox to specify that the nondeductible VAT must be added to the project cost when you purchase items for the project. Otherwise, the nondeductible VAT  won't influence the project cost and the full amount is recorded only at the general ledger level.
    4. Select the **Show Non-Ded. VAT In Lines** checkbox to specify that the nondeductible VAT must be shown on document line pages for easier manipulation of VAT amounts.

## Use the nondeductible VAT percentage

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **VAT Posting Setup** page, set the fields as described in the following table.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Allow Non-Deductible VAT** | Specify whether the nondeductible VAT is considered for the current combination of a VAT business posting group and a VAT product posting group. |
    | **Non-Deductible VAT %** | Specify the percentage of the transaction amount that VAT isn't applied to. |
    | **Non- Deductible Purchase VAT Account** | Specify the account associated with the VAT amount that isn't deducted because of the type of goods or services that are purchased. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > To have general ledger (G/L) entries that use the dedicated account instead of the sales/purchase account, you can either leave the **Non-Deductible Purchase VAT Account** field blank or set the **G/L Account** field.

3. Select **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use unrealized VAT together with non-deductible VAT.
>
> Don't use the same **VAT identifier** value for both normal VAT where the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field is set to **0** (zero) and normal VAT where the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field is set to a non-zero value. Otherwise, the total non-deductible VAT amount will be incorrectly calculated.

# Make drop shipments

A drop shipment is the shipment of items from one of your vendors directly to one of your customers.

When a sales order is marked for drop shipment, and you create a purchase order specifying the customer in the **Ship-to** field, **Customer Address**, you can link the two documents to instruct the vendor to ship directly to the customer.
<br><br>  
  
> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=58c81aa9-7190-476a-9fd9-75a9841549f7]

## To create a sales order for drop shipment

To prepare a drop shipment, you create a sales order for an item and indicate on the sales line that the sale requires drop shipment.

1. Create a sales order for an item. Learn more at [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
2. On the sales order line for the drop shipment, select the **Drop Shipment** checkbox. Alternatively, in the **Purchasing Code** field, select a purchasing code that has the **Drop Shipment** field selected.

> [!TIP]
> By default, the Drop Shipment checkbox and Purchasing Code field aren't available on the lines. If they aren't, you can add them by personalizing the section of page that contains the lines. Learn more at [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## To create the purchase order for drop shipment

To prepare a drop shipment, you indicate on the purchase order that it must be shipped to your customer, not to yourself.

1. Create a purchase order. Don't fill any fields on the lines. Learn more at [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).
2. In the **Ship-to** field, select **Customer Address**.
3. In the **Customer** field, select the customer that you're selling to.
4. Choose the **Drop Shipments** action, and then choose the **Get Sales Order** action.
5. On the **Sales List** page, select the sales order that you prepared in [To create a sales order for drop shipment](#to-create-a-sales-order-for-drop-shipment).
6. Choose the **OK** button.

The line information from the sales order is inserted on the purchase order line(s).

You can now tell your vendor to ship the items directly to the customer. For example, you might send them the order by email.

If your vendor provides additional information, such as a tracking number, you can add that information as a comment on a purchase order line. To add a comment on a line, in the **Type** field, choose **Comment**, and then enter the information in the **Description** field.  

## To create multiple purchase orders for drop shipments

You can also use the requisition worksheet to create purchase orders. The advantage of using the requisition worksheet is that it can create purchase orders for all outstanding drop shipments. That means you won't have to create each order individually.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Requisition Worksheets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Drop Shipments** action, and then choose the **Get Sales Order** action.
3. If needed, enter filter criteria for the orders you wan to get, and then choose the **OK** button.
4. Review the purchase order lines, and in the **Vendor No.** field, select the vendor that supplies the goods.
5. Choose the **Carry Out Action Message** action to convert the lines to a purchase order.

## To view the linked purchase order from the sales order

Select the drop-shipment sales order line, choose the **Order** action, choose the **Drop Shipment** action, and then choose the **Purchase Order** action.

## To post a drop shipment

After the vendor ships the items, you can post the sales order as shipped. You can also post the purchase order, but only with the **Receive** option until the sales order has been invoiced.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the sales order.
3. In the **Qty. to Ship** field, specify how many of the order quantity to ship, the full or a partial order quantity.
4. Choose the **Post** or **Post and Send** action.
5. Choose either the **Ship** option to invoice later, or the **Ship and Invoice** option to invoice immediately.

> [!TIP]
> Remember to post the purchase order invoice.

# Sales by Location (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Sales by Location** report provides an overview of sales performance at locations. It showcases key metrics such as total sales amount, total quantity sold, and cost of goods sold. You can break down the metrics further by specific items sold at each location.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-location.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Location Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-location.png":::

## Use the report

Leadership and management teams use the report to help them track revenue and cost breakdown per location. The report is valuable for any organization that operates across multiple locations.

For COOs of retail companies with multiple warehouse locations, it's important to have a high-level view of the sales performance of each location. The overview can help you make informed decisions about resource allocation and expansion plans. You can quickly view the total revenue generated by each location and identify under-performing locations. This information helps you make better decisions about resource allocation to ensure that the organization is operating efficiently and effectively across all locations.

Regional managers who oversee several warehouse locations can track revenue and cost breakdown per location, identify areas for improvement, and adjust sales strategies. Analyze the total sales amount, quantity sold, cost of goods sold, and gross profit for each location to find out which locations perform well and which ones need improvement.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- **[Sales Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)**  
- **[Sales Quantity](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-quantity)**  
- **[Cost Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount)**  
- **[Cost Amount Non-Inv](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount-non-inv)**  
- **[Gross Profit](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit)**  
- **[Gross Profit Margin](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit-margin)**

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Location
- Item
- Value Entry
- Sales Line

# Walkthrough: Picking and Shipping in Basic Warehouse Configurations

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you pick and ship items using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Outbound Process|Require Pick|Require Shipment|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------|----------------|-----|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post the pick and shipment from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post the pick and shipment from an inventory pick document|Turned on||Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post the pick and shipment from a warehouse shipment document||Turned on|Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post the pick from a warehouse pick document, and post the shipment from a warehouse shipment document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Outbount Warehouse Flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md).

The following walkthrough demonstrates method B in the previous table.  

## About This Walkthrough

In basic warehouse configurations where your location is set up to require pick processing but not ship processing, you use the **Inventory Pick** page to record and post pick and ship information for your outbound source documents. The outbound source document can be a sales order, purchase return order, outbound transfer order, or a production order with component need.  

This walkthrough demonstrates the following tasks:  

- Setting up SOUTH location for inventory picks.  
- Creating a sales order for customer 10000 for 30 Amsterdam Lamps.  
- Releasing the sales order for warehouse handling.  
- Creating an inventory pick based on a released source document.  
- Registering the warehouse movement from the warehouse and at the same time posting the sales shipment for the source sales order.  

## Roles

This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user roles:  

- Warehouse Manager  
- Order Processor  
- Warehouse Worker  

<!-- ## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you will need:  

- For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, a company based on the **Advanced Evaluation - Complete Sample Data** option in a sandbox environment. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, CRONUS installed.
 -->

## Story

Ellen, the warehouse manager at CRONUS, sets up SOUTH warehouse for basic pick handling where warehouse workers process outbound orders individually. Susan, the order processor, creates a sales order for 30 units of item 1928-S to be shipped to customer 10000 from the SOUTH Warehouse. John, the warehouse worker must make sure that the shipment is prepared and delivered to the customer. John manages all involved tasks on the **Inventory Pick** page, which automatically points to the bins where 1928-S is stored.

[!INCLUDE[set_up_location.md](includes/set_up_location.md)]

# Reconcile inventory costs with the general ledger

When you post inventory transactions, such as sales shipments, purchase invoices, or inventory adjustments, the changed item costs are recorded in item value entries. To reflect this change of inventory value in your financial books, the inventory costs also need to be posted to the related inventory accounts in the general ledger, such as the inventory account, adjustment account, and COGS account in the general ledger.

Unless you have selected the **Automatic Cost Posting** check box in the **Inventory Setup** window, inventory costs aren't recorded dynamically in the general ledger, and COGS isn't calculated with a sale. Therefore, you must post to the general ledger manually by running the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job to update the general ledger and potentially print a report of the value entries that are posted.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before you use this batch job, you should run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. This ensures that, when you run this batch job, the costs that will be posted to the general ledger are up to date. This is referred to as cost adjustment. For more information, see [Adjust Item Costs](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md).

## To post inventory costs manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**, and then choose the related link.

2. Post inventory costs to the general ledger manually by running the batch job. When you run this batch job, general ledger entries are created on the basis of value entries. To calculate the value to post, it uses the difference between the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field and the **Cost Posted to G/L** field in the value entries. If you have selected the **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** checkbox on the **Inventory Setup** page, the batch job also posts the difference between the **Cost Amount (Expected)** field and the **Exp. Cost Posted to G/L** field to interim accounts in the general ledger. You can post the entries so that they are summarized per posting group.

|Option  |Description  |
|--------------|---------|
|**Posting Method**|The batch job can either post inventory value to the general ledger per posting group or per posted entry. If you post per entry, you achieve a detailed specification of how the inventory affects the general ledger, but you also get numerous G/L entries. If you post per posting group, the batch job creates a general ledger entry per posting date per posting group combination. This means that a general ledger entry is created for each combination of posting date, general business posting group, general product posting group, inventory posting group, and location code. In addition, the batch job creates separate general ledger entries for costs with different signs.|
|**Document No.**|In this field, you can enter a document number if you have chosen the *Post per Inventory Posting Group* option. The document number appears on posted entries.|
|**Post**|Select this field if you want the batch job to post to the general ledger automatically. If you don't choose to post the inventory cost to G/L, the batch job will only print a test report showing the values that can be posted to the general ledger, and on the report will appear: **Test Report (not posted)**.|

> [!NOTE]  
> When you run this batch job, you might encounter errors having to do with missing setup or incompatible dimension setup. If the batch job encounters errors in the dimension setup, it overrides these errors and uses the dimensions of the value entry. For any other errors, the batch job skips posting the value entries and lists them at the end of the report in a section titled “Skipped Entries.” To post these entries, you must fix the errors.
> For example if you have not selected the **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** check box in the **Inventory Setup** window, then the last section of the report will list value entries that are skipped because they represent expected costs.

To see a list of errors before running the posting batch job, you can run the **Post Invt. Cost to G/L - Test** report. The test report lists all the errors encountered during a test posting. You can then fix the errors, and run the inventory cost posting batch job without skipping any entries.

If you would like to get an overview of what values could be posted to the general ledger without actually performing the posting, you can run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job without actually posting the values to the general ledger. You do this by clearing the check mark from the **Post** field on the request page. This way, when you run the batch job, the report is produced showing the values that are ready to be posted to the general ledger, but they aren't posted.

## To audit the reconciliation between the inventory ledger and the general ledger

The **Inventory - G/L Reconciliation** page provides the following:

- Exposes reconciliation differences by comparing what is recorded in G/L and what is recorded in the inventory ledger (value entries).
- Displays unreconciled cost amounts in the value entries in the inventory ledger as if they were mapped to corresponding inventory-related accounts in G/L and compares those to the totals recorded in the same accounts in G/L.
- Reflects the double entry structure of G/L by visually presenting data as such. For example, a COGS entry has a corresponding inventory entry.
- Lets users drill down and see the entries that make up the cost amounts.
- Includes filters to narrow the analysis by date, item, and location.
- Explains reasons for reconciliation differences in informative messages.


The **Name** column on the far left in the grid lists the various G/L account types that are associated with inventory.

The **Inventory**, **Inventory (Interim)**, and **WIP Inventory** columns show the invoiced, non-invoiced, and WIP totals of each G/L account type. These are calculated from value entries, that is, they're projected onto the G/L account types where they'll end when they're eventually posted to G/L.

The **Total** column shows the sum (in bold font) of the value entry amounts in the three inventory columns.

The **G/L Total** column shows the amounts (in bold font) for each G/L account type that exists in G/L. These are calculated from G/L entries, that is, they represent inventory costs already posted to G/L.

The **Difference** column represents the difference between the value in the **G/L Total** and **Total** fields.

In the top of the **Inventory - G/L Reconciliation** page, you can enter filters to limit, for example, the period of time for which you want information.

If you select the **Show Warning** check box and if there are any discrepancies between the inventory totals and G/L totals, application shows messages in the **Warning** field of the grid that explain the discrepancy. If you choose the Warning field, application gives you more information on what the warning means.

When you have entered all relevant filters, choose the **Show Matrix** action. The data is calculated and the matrix page appears.

On the far left column in the grid, you see the various general ledger account types that are associated with inventory. The grid then shows the invoiced, non-invoiced (interim), and WIP inventory totals for each of these account types. These totals are calculated from the value entries.

The next columns show the totals for the same account types calculated from the general ledger entries.

Choose the  amount in any of the total fields to see the inventory report entries that were used to calculate the totals. For inventory totals, the inventory report entries are the sums of the value entries for the items. For the G/L totals, the inventory report entries are the sums from the general ledger entries.

## Reporting Costs and Reconciling with the General Ledger
Other reports, tracing functions, and a special reconciliation tool are available to the auditor or controller responsible for reporting a correct and balanced inventory value to the finance department.

The following table describes them.    

|**To**|**See**|  
|------------|-------------|  
|View the inventory value of selected items, including information about the quantities and values of increases and decreases in inventory over a selected period.|**Inventory Valuation** report|  
|View the inventory value of selected production orders in your WIP (work in process) inventory, such as the quantities and values of consumption, capacity usage, and output in ongoing production orders.|**Inventory Valuation - WIP** report|  
|View the inventory value of selected items, including their actual and expected cost on the date specified.|**Invt. Valuation - Cost Spec.** report|  
|Use a report to analyze the reasons for cost variances or to gain insight into the cost shares of sold items (COGS).|**Cost Shares Breakdown** report|

# Manufacturing Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Power BI Manufacturing app gives insights into your manufacturing activities. Its detailed analytics and visualizations of manufacturing data help:

- Streamline manufacturing processes
- Improve decision-making at all levels of the organization
- Optimize production efficiency

## Manufacturing analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Operating Officer
- Chief Manufacturing Officer
  
### Example scenario: analyzing current utilization

COOs need to ensure that your manufacturing plant is operating at optimal levels. By analyzing the [Current Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-current-utilization.md) and [Historical Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-historical-utilization.md) reports, you can get a better understanding of how efficiently you're using your resources and identify areas for improvement.

You can also use the [Work Center Load](manufacturing-powerbi-work-center-load.md) report to identify bottlenecks in your production process, and make informed decisions to increase efficiency and productivity.

## Manufacturing analytics for the management team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Manufacturing Manager
- Operations Manager

### Example scenario: improving resource usage

Manufacturing managers ensure that all production orders are completed on time and within budget. Using the [Finished Production Order Breakdown](manufacturing-powerbi-finished-production-order-breakdown.md) and [Average Production Times](manufacturing-powerbi-average-production-times.md) reports, you can analyze the production time for each order and identify opportunities to optimize the production process.

The [Allocated Hours](manufacturing-powerbi-allocated-hours.md) report provides a detailed breakdown of allocated hours and aggregates them by work center. This report can help you catch unexpected spikes in resource usage.

By using the [Released Production Orders](manufacturing-powerbi-released-production-orders.md) report, you can also identify discrepancies in production patterns across different orders and make decisions.

## Manufacturing analytics for warehouse staff

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Manufacturing Supervisor
- Production Operator

### Example scenario: tracking production lines

Manufacturing supervisors ensure that goods and materials flow smoothly through the manufacturing facility. Your role is critical in maintaining the production schedule and meeting customer demand. The [Current Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-current-utilization.md) report shows the use of work centers in real-time, which helps you spot bottlenecks and optimize production processes.

You notice that one work center is consistently operating at full capacity, while others are underused. You use the [Historical Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-historical-utilization.md) report to analyze the historical use of work centers and find trends and patterns. This report helps you plan for future capacity needs and balance production across work centers.

To improve production efficiency, you track the allocated hours for each work center using the [Allocated Hours](manufacturing-powerbi-allocated-hours.md) report. This report helps you understand workloads and adjust staffing levels accordingly.

# Calculate order promising dates

A company must be able to inform their customers of order delivery dates. The **Order Promising Lines** page enables you to do this from a sales order.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates shipment and delivery dates based on an item’s known and expected availability dates, which you can promise to customers.  

If you specify a requested delivery date on a sales order line, then that date is used as the starting point for the following calculations:  

- requested delivery date - shipping time = planned shipment date  
- planned shipment date - outbound whse. handling time = shipment date  

If the items are available to pick on the shipment date, then the sales process can continue. If the items aren't available to be picked on the shipment date, then a stock-out warning is displayed.  

If you don't specify a requested delivery date on a sales order line, or if the requested delivery date can't be met, then the earliest date on which that the items are available is calculated. That date is then entered in the **Shipment Date** field on the line, and the date on which you plan to ship the items and the date on which they'll be delivered to the customer are calculated using the following calculations:  

- shipment date + outbound whse. handling time = planned shipment date  
- planned shipment date + shipping time = planned delivery date  

## About order promising

The Order Promising functionality enables you to promise an order to be shipped or delivered on a specific date. The date that an item is available to promise or capable to promise is calculated, and order lines are created for those dates that you accept. The functionality calculates the earliest possible date that an item is available for shipment or delivery. It also creates requisition lines, in case the items must first be purchased or produced, for those dates that you accept.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses two fundamental concepts:  

- Available to Promise (ATP)  
- Capable to Promise (CTP)  

### Available to promise

Available to promise (ATP) calculates dates based on the reservation system. It performs an availability check of the unreserved quantities in inventory about planned production, purchases, transfers, and sales returns. Based on this information, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the delivery date of the customer’s order because the items are available, either in inventory or on planned receipts.  

### Capable to promise

Capable to promise (CTP) assumes a “what if” scenario, which only applies to item quantities that aren't in inventory or on scheduled orders. Based on this scenario, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the earliest date that the item can be available if it's to be produced, purchased, or transferred.

#### Example

If there's an order for 10 pieces, and 6 pieces are available in inventory or on scheduled orders, then the capable to promise calculation will be based on 4 pieces.

### Calculations

When [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the customer’s delivery date, it performs two tasks:  

- Calculates the earliest delivery date when the customer hasn't requested a specific delivery date.  
- Verifies if the delivery date requested by the customer or promised to the customer is realistic.  

If the customer doesn't request a specific delivery date, the shipment date is set to equal the work date, and availability is then based on that date. If the item is in inventory, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates forward in time to determine when the order can be delivered. This is accomplished by the following formulas:  

- Shipment Date + Outbound Warehouse Handling Time = Planned Shipment Date  
- Planned Shipment Date + Shipping Time = Planned Delivery Date  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] then verifies if the calculated delivery date is realistic by calculating backward in time to determine when the item must be available to meet the promised date. This is accomplished by the following formulas:  

- Planned Delivery Date - Shipping Time = Planned Shipment Date  
- Planned Shipment Date - Outbound Warehouse Handling = Shipment Date  

The shipment date is used to make the availability check. If the item is available on this date, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] confirms that the requested/promised delivery can be met by setting the planned delivery date to equal the requested/promised delivery date. If the item is unavailable, it returns a blank date and the order processor can then use the CTP functionality.  

Based on new dates and times, all related dates are calculated according to the formulas listed earlier in this section. The CTP calculation takes longer but it gives an accurate date when the customer can expect to have the item delivered. The dates that are calculated from CTP are presented in the **Planned Delivery Date** and **Earliest Shipment Date** fields on the **Order Promising Lines** page.  

The order processor finishes the CTP process by accepting the dates. This means that a planning line and a reservation entry are created for the item before the calculated dates to ensure that the order is fulfilled.  

In addition to the external order promising that you can perform on the **Order Promising Lines** page, you can also promise internal or external delivery dates for bill-of-material items. For more information, see [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md).

## To set up order promising

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Order Promising Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Enter a number and time unit code in the **Offset(Time)** field. Select one of the following codes.  

    |Code|Description|  
    |----------|-----------------|  
    |**d**|Calendar day|  
    |**w**|Week|  
    |**m**|Month|  
    |**q**|Quarter|  
    |**y**|Year|  

    For example, "3w" indicates that the offset time is three weeks. To indicate the current period, prefix to any of these codes with the letter “c”. For example, if you want the offset time to be the current month, enter **cm**.  
3. Enter a number series in the **Order Promising Nos.** field by selecting a line from the list on the **No. Series** page.  
4. Enter an order promising template in the **Order Promising Template** field by selecting a line from the list on the **Req. Worksheet Template List** page.  
5. Enter a requisition worksheet in the **Order Promising Worksheet** field by selecting a line from the list on the **Req. Wksh. Names** page.

### Inbound and outbound warehouse handling times in order promising

If you want to include warehouse handling time in the order promising calculation on the purchase line, on the **Inventory Setup** page you can specify a default handling time to use on sales and purchase documents. You can also enter specific times for each of your locations on the **Location Card** page. 

#### To enter default inbound and outbound warehouse handling times for sales and purchase documents

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Inbound Whse. Handling Time** and **Outbound Whse. Handling Time** fields, enter the number of days that you want to include in the order promising calculations.  

#### To enter inbound and outbound warehouse handling times on locations

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Location**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the relevant location card.  
3.  On the **Warehouse** FastTab, in the **Inbound Whse. Handling Time** and **Outbound Whse. Handling Time** fields, enter the number of days that you want to be included in the order promising calculations.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  When you are creating a purchase order, if you choose **Location** in the **Ship-to** field on the **Shipping and Payment** FastTab, and then choose a location in the **Location Code** field, the **Outbound Whse. Handling Time** and **Inbound Whse. Handling Time** fields will use the handling time specified for the location. For sales orders, the same is true if you choose a location in the **Location Code** field. If no handling time is specified for the location, the **Outbound Whse. Handling Time** and **Inbound Whse. Handling Time** fields will be blank. If you leave the **Location Code** field blank on sales and purchase documents, the calculation uses the handling time specified on the **Inventory Setup**  page.

## To make an item critical

Before an item can be included in the order promising calculation, it must be marked as critical. This setup ensures that non-critical items don't cause irrelevant order promising calculations.   
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the relevant item card.  
3.  On the **Planning** FastTab, select the **Critical** field.  

## To calculate an order promising date

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the relevant sales order and select the sales order lines that you want application to calculate.  
3.  Choose the **Order Promising** action, and then choose the **Order Promising Lines** action.  
4.  Select a line, and then select one of the following options:  

    - Select **Available-to-Promise** if you want to calculate the earliest date that the item will be available with respect to inventory, scheduled receipts, and gross requirements.  
    - Select **Capable-to-Promise** if you know that the item is presently out of stock and you want to calculate the earliest date that the item can be available by issuing new replenishment requisitions.  
5.  Choose the **Accept** button to accept the earliest shipment date available.

## Getting around in Business Central

Here's a short video about how to get around in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/embed/zqz03iMihx0]

## Choosing a desktop browser

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports multiple browsers, and each browser offers various features. The browser plays a significant role in the responsiveness and fluidity of the user interface. Check out the list of supported, recommended browsers for [Business Central online](./product-requirements.md) and browsers for [Business Central on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/system-requirement-business-central-v15).

- Where possible, avoid older browsers such as Internet Explorer. Instead, switch to one of our recommended modern browsers, such as the [new Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/).  

    > [!NOTE]
    > Internet Explorer is no longer supported. To learn more, go to [Microsoft Edge documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/hub/4337664/microsoft-edge-help).
- Keep your browser up to date with the latest version.

## Action bars

Inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you do most of your work in a list, a document, or a card. All pages have a bar with actions that are relevant to them. The actions are almost the same for the individual card or document and the list of entities. This way, you can manage an individual sales order in the **Sales Order** page and in the **Sales Orders** list, including posting it and invoicing it.  

How you open a page and the context of what you're doing affect whether actions are available. Actions can appear differently, not be available, or even not be present. Not all actions are relevant, or supported, for all processes. Also, some actions require that you make a selection. If an action isn't relevant or supported, we make them unavailable. We do that to help clarify what you can do with your selections.

Specifically for list pages, the list page that you open from the home page and the page that opens when you use the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon to search for it aren't identical.  

When you search for and open a list page, such as the **Sales Orders** list, it's in view mode. The actions for editing, viewing, or deleting an individual entity, such as a sales order, are shown when you choose the **Manage** action.  

> [!TIP]
> If you know that you'll often use actions on the second level of the action bar, choose the :::image type="icon" source="media/pin.png" border="false"::: icon to pin the action bar and make the actions under the various menus immediately discoverable.
>
> To hide the second level of the action bar again, choose the :::image type="icon" source="media/unpin.png" border="false"::: icon.

When you open the same list page from your home page, the **Manage** action isn't available. Instead, to open an individual sales order, choose the **Number** field. In this view, you can't pin the action bar.

# Dimension Set Entries Overview
This topic describes how dimension set entries are stored and posted in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Dimension Sets  
A dimension set is a unique combination of dimension values. It is stored as dimension set entries in the database. Each dimension set entry represents a single dimension value. The dimension set is identified by a common dimension set ID that is assigned to each dimension set entry that belongs to the dimension set.  

The following example shows a dimension set that has three dimension set entries. The dimension set is identified by a dimension set ID, which is 108.  

|Dimension Set ID|Dimension Code|Dimension Value Code|Dimension Value Name|  
|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|  
|108|AREA|70|America North|  
|108|BUSINESSGROUP|HOME|Home|  
|108|DEPARTMENT|SALES|Sales|  

## Dimension Set Entries  
Dimension sets are stored in the **Dimension Set Entry** table as dimension set entries with the same dimension set ID.  

![Flow of dimension set entries.](media/dimensionentrynav7.png "Flow of dimension set entries")  

When you create a new journal line, document header, or document line, you can specify a combination of dimension values. Instead of explicitly storing each dimension value in the database, a dimension set ID is assigned to the journal line, document header, or document line to specify the dimension set.  

When you edit and close the **Edit Dimension Set Entries** page, a check is performed to see whether the combination of dimension values exists as a dimension set in the table. If the combination occurs in the table, then the corresponding dimension set ID is assigned to the journal line, document header, or document line. Otherwise, a new dimension set is added to the table, and the new dimension set ID is assigned to the journal line, document header, or document line.

## Codeunit 408 Dimension Management
Codeunit 408, Dimension Management, is a function library that handles common tasks that are related to dimensions, such as copying from one table to another or from one document to another.

## Performance Improvement  
By storing dimension sets once in the database, database space is preserved and overall performance is improved.

# Primary capabilities of financial reporting

This article describes the capabilities that are most widely used for the financial reporting features in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Out of the box financial reporting

To help you get started with financial reporting, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides account categories, subcategories, and mappings to the company’s chart of accounts for basic financial reporting.

## Custom financial reporting

If you're already familiar with financial reporting and you want more complex reports, you can create your own.

## Comparative views

Beyond monthly balances or net changes, you can apply multiple views to any report you create. For example, you can use formula combinations for standard month to date and year to date views, view trends over the last 12 months, compare current amounts with the prior month or year, and more.

## Direct tie to the general ledger

Financial reporting is tied directly to detailed transactional postings from the general ledger.

## Use dimensions

Dimensions are data tags you can attach to postings to the general ledger to provide more business insights to financial reporting. Adding dimensions enriches the reports and expands them into operational reporting.

## Budget integration

Financial reporting can easily compare budget and actual financial results. You can do the comparisons for any date range and view the results at the general ledger and dimension levels.

## Ability to drill down

Numbers in financial reporting that aren't calculated by a formula can take you to the original transactions. You can make active analyses from the financial report to the account level, and from there to the invoices, credit memos, and ledger entries. This quick research tool lets you determine where the number came from, when it happened, what type of document was used, and even which user created the entry.

## Export to Excel

The Export to Excel feature lets you format financial reporting so that it looks the same every month, without manual work. Export to Excel makes it easy to produce a professional-looking financial package where values update each period.

## No coding needed

Financial reporting doesn't require that you know how to code. Finance professionals can build their own reports and make changes exactly when they need to. It's helpful, however, to understand:

* The structure of the chart of accounts.
* The dimensions that are used.
* The budget amounts.
* The basic differences between balance sheet and income statement accounts.
* Basic formulas.

# Set up invoice rounding

If you need to round invoice amounts when you create invoices, you can use the automatic rounding function. When an invoice is rounded, an extra line is added with the rounding amount and posted with the other invoice lines.

> [!NOTE]  
> Local regulations or local custom might require that you to round invoice amounts in a specific way. For example, to an amount divisible by 0.05.  

To use automatic invoice rounding, you must:  

* Specify the general ledger accounts to which rounding differences are posted.  
* Set up rules for rounding invoices in local currency and in foreign currency.  
* Activate the function.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  In addition to the invoice rounding features, you can round amounts on invoices by the unit-amount rounding feature and the amount rounding feature.  

## Set up general ledger accounts for invoice rounding differences

To use automatic invoice rounding, you must set up the general ledger account or accounts where rounding differences are posted. Before you can do so, you must set up VAT product posting groups. For more information, see [Set up VAT](finance-setup-vat.md).  

### To set up general ledger accounts for invoice rounding differences  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, set up the account and name it **Invoice Rounding** or something similar. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the account name as text for invoices that are rounded.  
3. Depending on whether you use VAT or sales tax, in the **Tax Prod. Posting Group** or **VAT Prod. Posting Group** fields, choose a posting group for rounded amounts. You might want to set up a new group code to use for invoice rounding.
4. Leave the **Gen. Posting Type**, and either the **Tax Bus. Posting Group** or **VAT Bus. Posting Group** fields blank. <!-- Why do we say to leave these blank, when there are a lot of other fields we also leave blank but don't mention? -->  

Now you can assign the invoice rounding account to posting groups on the **Vendor Posting Groups** page.  <!-- Why only the vendor posting groups? -->

## Set up rounding for foreign and local currencies
Before you can use the automatic invoice rounding function, you must set up rounding rules for foreign and local currencies.

### To set up rounding for foreign currencies  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Currencies**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Currencies** page, choose the foreign currency to open the **Currency Card**, and then fill in the **Amount Rounding Precision**, **Unit-Amount Rounding Precision**, **Invoice Rounding Precision** and **Invoice Rounding Type** fields.

### To set up rounding for your local currency
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, on the **General** FastTab, fill in the **Inv. Rounding Precision** and **Inv. Rounding Type** fields.  

## Activate the invoice rounding function  
To ensure that sales and purchase invoices are rounded automatically, you must activate the invoice rounding function. You activate invoice rounding separately for sales and purchase invoices.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup** or **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, choose the **Invoice Rounding** check box.

# Control access to Business Central using security groups

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Security groups make it easier for administrators to manage user permissions. For example, for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, they're reusable across Dynamics 365 applications, such as SharePoint Online, CRM Online, and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Administrators add permissions to their [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] security groups, and when they add users to the group the permissions apply to all members. For example, an administrator can create a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] security group that gives salespeople the ability to create and post sales orders. Or, let purchasers do the same for purchase orders.

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes how to grant certain permissions to users based on their membership of a security group. To control whether users can access an environment based on their membership of a security group, see [Manage Access to Environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access).

## Business Central online and on-premises

You can use security groups for the online and on-premises versions of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Depending on your version, create groups in one of the following ways:

* For the online version, use Microsoft Entra security groups. To learn more about creating the group, go to [Create, edit, or delete a security group in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/email/create-edit-or-delete-a-security-group).
* For on-premises, security groups are only supported if the deployment is using Windows authentication. To create security groups for on-premises, use Windows Active Directory groups. To learn more, go to [Create a Group Account in Windows Active Directory](/windows/security/operating-system-security/network-security/windows-firewall/create-a-group-account-in-active-directory). 

Afterward, create a corresponding security group in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and then link it to the group you created. To learn more, go to [Add a security group in Business Central](#add-a-security-group-in-business-central).

> [!NOTE]
> If you've set up a special type of user with a Windows Group license type in a version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-prem that's earlier than 2023 release wave 1, when you upgrade [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] converts the user to a security group. The new security group has the same name as the Windows group name. The security group gives you a better overview of the group members and their effective permissions.

## Add a security group in Business Central

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Security Groups**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose **New** to create a group.
1. Create the link to your group, as follows:

    * For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, choose the group in the **Microsoft Entra security group name** field.
    * For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, choose the group in the **Windows group name** field.

> [!NOTE]
> The users show in the **Members** card on the FactBox pane or the **Security Group Members** page only if they're added as users in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about adding users, go to [To add users or update user information and license assignments in Business Central](ui-how-users-permissions.md#adduser).  

### Assign permissions to a security group

1. On the **Security Groups** page, choose the group, and then choose the **Permissions** action.
1. Assign permissions in the following ways:

    * To assign permission sets individually, in the **Permission Set** field, choose the permissions to assign.
    * To assign multiple permission sets, choose the **Add multiple** action, and then choose the sets to assign.
1. If you want the permission sets to apply only to a specific company, set the **Company** column to that company. If you want the permission set to apply to all companies, leave the **Company** column blank. [Learn more](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#control-access-to-specific-companies).

# Enabling new and upcoming features ahead of time

Some new features can be enabled ahead of time, letting you take advantage of them as early as possible. Enabling features early gives you the time to test and prepare your organization for change.

When Microsoft releases features or feature design improvements as part of minor updates, some of the features aren't immediately enabled. Administrators can enable each feature from the **Feature Management** page. After a feature is enabled, it becomes available for all users on that environment no matter how they access [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Features can be safely turned off again. These features are only optional for a while.

Learn more in [Feature Management](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

# Dispose of or retire fixed assets

When you sell or otherwise dispose of a fixed asset, you must post the disposal value to calculate and record the gain or loss. A disposal entry must be the last entry posted for a fixed asset. For partially disposed fixed assets, you can post more than one disposal entry. The total of all posted disposal amounts must be a credit amount.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you trade-in a fixed asset for another one, you must record both the sale of the old asset (disposal) and the purchase of the new one (acquisition). For more information, see [Acquire Fixed Assets](fa-how-acquire.md).  

The following steps assume that your posting groups are set up on the **FA Posting Groups** page. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).  

## To post a disposal from the fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create an initial journal line and fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Disposal**.  
4. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for disposal posting.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Step 4 only works if you have set up the following: On the **FA Posting Group Card** page for the posting group of the fixed asset, the **Disposal Account** field contains the general ledger debit account and the **Disposal Bal. Account** field contains the general ledger account to which you want to post balancing entries for appreciation. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).  
5. Choose the **Post** action.  

If you sell or dispose of part of a fixed asset, you must split up the asset before you can record the disposal transaction. For more information, see [Transfer, Split, or Combine Fixed Assets](fa-how-trans-split-combine.md).  

## To view disposal ledger entries

When you sell or dispose of a fixed asset, the disposal value is posted to the general ledger where you can view the result.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the fixed asset that you want to view entries for, and then choose the **Depreciation Books** action.  
3. Select the depreciation book that you want to view entries for, and then choose the **Ledger Entries** action.  
4. Select a line with **Disposal** in the **FA Posting Category** field, and then choose the **Find Entries** action.  
5. On the **Find Entries** page, select the general ledger entry line, and then choose the **Show Related Entries** action.  

The **General Ledger Entries** page opens where you can see the entries that the disposal posting resulted in.

# Set Up Shop Calendars

A work center or machine calendar specifies the working days and hours, shifts, holidays, and absences that determine the center’s gross available capacity, measured in time, according to its defined efficiency and capacity values.

As a foundation for calculating a specific work or machine center calendar, you must first set up one or more general shop calendars. A shop calendar defines a standard work week according to start and end times of each working day and the work shift relation. In addition, the shop calendar defines the fixed holidays during a year.  

The following describes how to set up work center calendars. The steps are similar when setting up machine center calendars.  

## To create work shifts  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work Shifts**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On a blank line, enter a number in the **Code** field to identify the work shift, for example, **1**.  
3.  Describe the work shift in the **Description** field, for example, **1st shift**.  
4.  Optionally, fill in lines for a second or third work shift.  

Even if your work centers do not work in different work shifts, enter at least one work shift code.  

## To set up a shop calendar  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shop Calendars**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On a blank line, enter a number in the **Code** field to identify the shop calendar.  
3.  Describe the shop calendar in the **Description** field.  
4.  Choose the **Working Days** action.
5.  On the **Shop Calendar Working Days** page, define a complete work week, with the start and end times for each day.  

    In the **Work Shift Code** field, select one of the shifts that you previously defined. Add a line for every working day and every shift. For example:  

    Monday  07:00 15:00 1   
    Tuesday 07:00 15:00 1  

    If you need a shop calendar with two work shifts, you must fill it in in this manner:  

    Monday 07:00 15:00 1   
    Monday 15:00 23:00 2  
    Tuesday 07:00 15:00 1  
    Tuesday 15:00 23:00 2  

    Any week days that you do not define in the shop calendar, such as Saturday and Sunday, are considered non-working days and will have zero available capacity in a work center calendar.  

    When all the working days of a week are defined, you can close the **Shop Calendar Working Days** page and proceed to enter holidays.  

6.  On the **Shop Calendars** page, select the shop calendar, and then choose the **Holidays** action.
7. On the **Shop Calendar Holidays** page, define the holidays of the year by entering the start date and time, the end time, and description of each holiday on individual lines. For example:  

    04/07/14 0:00:00 23:59:00 Summer Holiday  
    05/07/14 0:00:00 23:59:00 Summer Holiday  
    06/07/14 0:00:00 23:59:00 Summer Holiday  

The defined holidays will have zero available capacity in a work center calendar.  

The shop calendar can now be assigned to a work center to calculate the work shop calendar that will govern all operation scheduling at that work center.  

## To calculate a work center calendar  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work Centers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the work center that you want to update.  
3. In the **Shop Calendar Code** field, select which shop calendar to use as the foundation for a work center calendar.  
4. Choose the **Calendar** action.  
5. On the **Work Center Calendar** page, choose the **Show Matrix** action.  

    The left side of the matrix page lists the work centers that are set up. The right side shows a calendar displaying the available capacity values for each working day in the defined unit of measure, for example, **480** minutes. Each line represents the calendar of one work center.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can also select to view the capacity values for each week or month by changing the selection in the **View By** field on the **Work Center Calendar** page.  

    To reflect the new shop calendar as a line on the selected work center, it must first be calculated.  

6.  Choose the **Calculate** action.  
7.  On the **Work Center** FastTab, you can set a filter to only calculate for one work center. If you do not set a filter, all existing work center calendars will be calculated.  
8.  Define the starting and ending dates of the calendar period that should be calculated, for example, one year from 01/01/14 to 31/12/14.
9. Choose the **OK** button to calculate capacity.  

Calendar entries are now created or updated displaying the available capacity for each period according to the following three sets of master data:  

- The working days and shift defined in the assigned shop calendar.  
- The value in the **Capacity** field on the work center card.  
- The value in the **Efficiency** field on the work center card.  

The calculated work center calendar will now define when and how much capacity is available at this work center. This controls the detailed scheduling of operations performed at the work center.  

## To record work center absence  
1.  On the **Work Center Calendar** page, choose the **Show Matrix** action.
2. On the **Work Center Calendar Matrix** page, select the work center and calendar day when the absence time should be recorded, and then choose the **Absence** action.  
3.  On the **Absence** page, define the starting time, ending time, and description of that day’s absence. For example:  

    25/01/01 08:00 10:00 Maintenance  

4.  Choose the **Update** action, and then close the **Absence** page.  

The capacity of the selected day has now decreased by the recorded absence time.

# Setting Up Data Exchange

Before you can send and receive electronic documents or import and export bank files, you must set up the data exchange framework to process the involved files. In addition, you must set up related areas, such as the customers that you send electronic invoices to, or the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension if you use the external service provider to convert your bank files. For more information, see [Exchanging Data Electronically](across-data-exchange.md).  

 When [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is set up to exchange data with external files, users can use the setup in common business tasks, such as sending and receiving electronic documents and importing and exporting bank files.  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Set Up Business Central Access in Teams with Microsoft 365 Licenses

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Administrators must complete multiple activities before users can access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with their Microsoft 365 license. The steps below represent the minimum setup required to get started. To learn more about access with Microsoft 365 licenses, go to [Business Central Access with Microsoft 365 Licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md).

## Guidelines

Setting up access with Microsoft 365 licenses involves the following tasks:

|Step|Task|Required|
|-|-|-|
|1|[Configure which Business Central data the Microsoft 365 licensed users have permission to view](#configure-permissions)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
|2|[Enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses on the Business Central environment](#enable-access-with-microsoft-365-licenses)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
|3|[Assign security group to the environment](#choose-who-gets-access-by-using-security-group)|
|4|[Deploy the Business Central app for Teams to users](#deploy-the-business-central-app-for-teams)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
|5|[Test the setup](#test-your-setup)||

> [!TIP]
> Except for the last task, you can complete the tasks in any order. You can do tasks separately, as described in the sections that follow or use the **Access with Microsoft 365 licenses** assisted setup guide to walk you through them.
>
> To run the assisted setup, do the following steps:
>
> 1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link.
> 2. On the **Assisted Setup** page, go to the **Do more with Business Central** section and select **Access with Microsoft 365 licenses**.
> 3. Follow the instructions.  

## Configure permissions

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is secure by design and minimizes risk by granting no permissions to Microsoft 365 users out of the box. Administrators must configure object permissions that determine which tables, pages and reports can be accessed in Teams with only a Microsoft 365 license. These permissions are the starting permissions assigned when a user signs in for the first time with their Microsoft 365 license. 

To configure starting permissions:

1. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], search for **License Configuration**.
2. Select the Microsoft 365 license.
3. At the top of the **Microsoft 365** license page, select the edit icon ![Edit icon](media/edit-pencil.png), then turn on **Customize permissions**. 
4. In the **Custom Permission Sets** section, add the appropriate permission sets and choose whether they're applicable to a single company or all companies within the environment.

With this configuration, users with only a Microsoft 365 license are added to the **Users** list when they access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for the first time. For more information about users, go to [Creating Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When synchronizing the users list in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with users in Microsoft 365, only users that have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license are added to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s users list. For more administrative control over permissions and profiles, you can assign a security group to the environment. When environments are secured using a security group and enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses, the **Update users from Microsoft 365** action in the **Users** page will also include users that only have a Microsoft 365 license. To learn about securing environments, see [Manage access using Microsoft Entra groups](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access#manage-access-using-azure-active-directory-groups) in the developer and IT pro help.

> [!TIP]
> Looking for a quicker way to get started when trying out this feature on a sandbox or evaluation company? Assign the **D365 Read** permission set, which grants permission to most objects.  

When working with multiple environments, license configuration must be applied to each environment and can be different on each environment.

Learn more at [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md) and [Composing Permission Sets](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-permissionset-composing).

## Enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses

Access with Microsoft 365 licenses is off by default. Access must be enabled for each environment independently, giving administrators control and allowing for staged rollout across the organization. You turn on access by using the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] admin center: 

1. In the upper-right corner, select **Settings** ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") > **Admin Center**.  
2. In the admin center, select **Environments**, then select the environment on which you want to change license access. 
3. On the **Environment details** page, select **Modify** for the **Access with Microsoft 365 licenses** setting.
4. In the **Microsoft 365 licenses** pane, turn on the switch. 
5. Select **Save** when done and accept the confirmation. The change comes into effect immediately.

## Choose who gets access by using security group

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

In the Business Center admin center, an environment can be assigned to one or more security groups to control access. You can assign a Microsoft Entra group to the environment. By assigning a Microsoft Entra group to an environment, only direct and indirect members of the group are granted access to the environment. Indirect members are users in another group, which itself is a member of the group assigned to the environment. Although all licensed users in Microsoft Entra ID will be added to the environment when it's synchronized with Microsoft 365, only group members can sign in. Learn more in [Manage access using Microsoft Entra groups](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access#manage-access-using-azure-active-directory-groups) in the developer and IT pro help.

People in the security group must also have an applicable Microsoft 365 license to access Business Central from within Microsoft Teams. Get a list of applicable licenses in [Business Central access with Microsoft 365 licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md#requirements-for-individual-users-to-access-data-in-teams).

## Deploy the Business Central app for Teams

For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license holders to share data in Teams, and for Microsoft 365 license holders to access that data, each must have the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams installed. Although users can install the app by themselves, it's recommended that administrators use centralized deployment. Centralized deployment lets you roll out the app to a broader audience across the organization and minimize individual user effort. Laern more in [Installing the Business Central app by using Centralized Deployment](admin-teams-integration.md#installing-the-business-central-app-by-using-centralized-deployment).

> [!NOTE]
> If you have run centralized deployment before and only deployed the app to the security group of licensed [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users, you'll need to run it again to deploy to additional groups or the whole organization, depending on how you are configuring access.

> [!TIP]
> Looking for a quicker way to get started when trying out this feature? Test users can install the app at [aka.ms/BCgetTeamsApp](https://aka.ms/BCgetTeamsApp).

## Test your setup

To verify that your setup is ready for production, the following steps will help you build the confidence that everything works as it should.

1. Create or identify two test users (A and B).

   - Test user A must have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license and Microsoft 365 license with access to Teams.
   - Test user B must have only a Microsoft 365 license with access to Teams.

2. Sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] web client as test user A.

   1. Open a record that test user B should have access to, such as an **Item** card in the appropriate company and environment.
   2. Select **Share** ![!Share to other apps action on pages.](media/share-icon.png) > **Share to Teams** to bring up the Share to Teams window.
   3. In the **Share to** field, add test user B as the recipient.
   4. Wait for the link to expand to a card and select Share.

3. Sign into Microsoft Teams as test user B.

   1. Select Chat and open the conversation with test user A.
   2. In the message sent by test user A, select the Details button on the card. If the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client is displayed and is read-only, your setup was successful.

# Work with general journals

Most financial transactions are posted to the general ledger through documents such as purchase invoices and sales orders. However by posting journal lines, you can also process business activities such as:

* Purchasing
* Payments
* Using recurring journals to post accruals
* Refunding employee expenses

Most journals are based on the general journal, and you can process all transactions on the **General Journals** page. Learn more at [Post Transactions Directly to the General Ledger](finance-how-post-transactions-directly.md).  

For example, you can use post employee expenses for reimbursement. Learn more at [Record and Reimburse Employees' Expenses](finance-how-record-reimburse-employee-expenses.md).

However, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also offers journals that are optimized for specific types of transactions, such as the *Payment Journal* for registering payments. Learn more at [Record Payments and Refunds in the Payment Journal](payables-how-post-payments-refunds.md).  

You use general journals to post financial transactions to general ledger accounts and various other accounts. The other accounts include bank, customer, vendor, and employee accounts. Posting with a general journal creates entries on general ledger accounts even when, for example, you post a journal line to a customer account. The entry is posted to a general ledger receivables account through a posting group.

The information that you enter in a journal is temporary and can be changed while it's in the journal. When you post the journal, the information is transferred to entries on individual accounts, where it can't be changed. You can, however, unapply posted entries, and you can post reversing or correcting entries. Learn more at [Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments](finance-how-reverse-journal-posting.md).

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip](includes/journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip.md)]  

## Add context to general journal transactions

When you create a journal, you can add links that give context to its transactions. When you post the journal, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] copies the links to the posted journal and ledger entries the journal creates. For example, providing links can make life easier for your auditor. If you keep images of your expense receipts on your company's Sharepoint site, you can add links to the files. When you post the journal to submit your expenses, your auditor can quickly get to the receipt files.

## Use journal templates and batches

There are several general journal templates. Each journal template is represented by a dedicated page with particular functions and the fields that are required to support those functions, such as the **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page to process bank payments and the **Payment Journals** page to pay your vendors or reimburse your employees. Learn more at [Make Payments](payables-make-payments.md) and [Reconcile Customer Payments with the Cash Receipt Journal or from Customer Ledger Entries](receivables-how-apply-sales-transactions-manually.md).

For each journal template, you can set up your own personal journal as a journal batch. For example, you can define your own journal batch for the payment journal that has your personal layout and settings. The following tip is an example of how to personalize a journal.

> [!TIP]  
> If you select the **Suggest Balancing Amount** checkbox on the line for your batch on the **General Journal Batches** page, then the **Amount** field on, for example, general journal lines for the same document number is automatically prefilled with the value that is required to balance the document. Learn more at [Letting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Suggest Values](ui-let-system-suggest-values.md).

> [!TIP]
> You can add or remove fields in journals by personalizing them. Learn more at [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

### Validating general journal batches

You can turn on a background check that helps prevent delays when posting. The check notifies you when a mistake in the financial journal you're working on will prevent you from posting the journal. On the **General Journal Batches** page, you can choose **Background Error Check** to have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] validate finance journals, such as general or payment journals, while you're working on them.

When you enable the validation, the **Check Document** or **Journal Check** FactBoxes show issues in the current line and the whole batch. Validation happens when you load a finance journal batch, and when you choose another journal line. The **Issues total** tile in the FactBox shows the total number of issues that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] found, and you can choose it to open an overview of the issues.

You can use the **Show Lines with Issues** and **Show All Lines** actions to toggle between journal lines that do or don't have issues. The **Journal Line Details** FactBox provides quick overview and access to data from journal lines, such as the G/L account, customer, or vendor, and the posting setup for specific accounts.

[!INCLUDE [background_doc_journal_check](includes/background_doc_journal_check.md)]  

## Understanding main accounts and balancing accounts

If you set up default balancing accounts for the journal batches on the **General Journals** page, the balancing account is filled in automatically when you fill in the **Account No.** field. Otherwise, fill in both the **Account No.** and **Bal. Account No.** fields manually. A positive amount in the **Amount** field is debited to the main account and credited to the balancing account. A negative amount is credited to the main account and debited to the balancing account.

> [!NOTE]  
> VAT is calculated separately for the main account and the balancing account, so they can use different VAT percentage rates.

## Work with recurring journals

A recurring journal is a general journal with specific fields for managing transactions that you often post with few, if any, changes. For example, transactions for expenses such as rent, subscriptions, electricity, and heat. Using recurring journals lets you post fixed and variable amounts, and specify automatic reversal entries for the day after the posting date. Allocation keys let you divide the recurring entries among various accounts. Learn more at [Allocating Recurring Journal Amounts to Several Accounts](#allocating-recurring-journal-amounts-to-several-accounts).

With a recurring journal, you create the entries that you post regularly only one time. For example, the accounts, dimensions, dimension values, and so on, stay in the journal after posting. If changes are needed, you can make them each time you post.

### Recurring Method field

The **Recurring Method** field is important. It determines how to treat the amount on the journal line after posting. For example, if you use the same amount every time you post the line, you can let the amount remain. If you'll use the same accounts and text on the line, but the amount varies every time you post, you can delete the amount after posting.

| To | See |
| --- | --- |
|F Fixed|The amount on the journal line remains after posting. Lines with amounts of zero remain in the journal, but aren't posted. You can update the amount in a later run.  |
|V Variable|The amount on the journal line is deleted after posting.|
|B Balance|The posted amount on the account on the line is allocated among the accounts specified for the line in the Gen. Jnl. Allocation table. The balance on the account is set to zero. Remember to fill in the **Allocation %** field on the **Allocations** page. For more information, see [Allocating Recurring Journal Amounts to Several Accounts](#allocating-recurring-journal-amounts-to-several-accounts).|
|RF Reversing Fixed|The amount on the journal line remains after posting, and a balancing entry is posted on the next day.|
|RV Reversing Variable|The amount on the journal line is deleted after posting, and a balancing entry is posted on the next day.|
|RB Reversing Balance|The posted amount on the account on the line is allocated among the accounts specified for the line on the **Allocations** page. The balance on the account is set to zero, and a balancing entry is posted on the next day.|
|BD Balance by Dimension|The journal line allocates costs based on a G/L account's balance by dimension. You're prompted to set the dimension filters to be used to calculate the source G/L account's balance by dimension from which you want to allocate costs. As an alternative, choose the **Set Dimension Filters** action later.|
|RBD Reversing Balance by Dimension|The journal line allocates costs based on a G/L account's reversing balance by dimension. You're prompted to set the dimension filters to use to calculate the source G/L account's balance by dimension from which you want to allocate costs. You can also choose the **Set Dimension Filters** action later.|

> [!NOTE]  
> The VAT fields can be filled in on either the recurring journal line or on the allocation journal line but not on both. That is, they can be filled in on the **Allocations** page only if the corresponding lines in the recurring journal are not filled in.

### Recurring Frequency field

This date formula field determines how often to post the entry on the journal line, and it must be filled in. Learn more at [Use Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas).

#### Examples

If the journal line must be posted every month, enter **1M**. After every posting, the date in the **Posting Date** field will be updated to the same date in the next month.

If you want to post an entry on the last day of every month, you can take one of the following actions:

* Post the first entry on the last day of a month by entering 1D+1M-1D (1 day + 1 month - 1 day). With this formula, the posting date is calculated correctly regardless of how many days there are in the month.

* Post the first entry on any day of the month by entering 1M+CM. With this formula, the posting date will be after one full month + the remaining days of the current month.

### Expiration Date field

This field determines the date on which the line is posted for the last time. The line won't be posted after this date.

The advantage of using the Expiration Date field is that the line isn't deleted from the journal immediately. You can enter a later date so that you can use the line in the future.

If the field is blank, the line is posted every time until you delete it from the journal.

### Allocating recurring journal amounts to several accounts

On the **Recurring General Journals** page, you can choose the **Allocations** action to specify how to allocate amounts on the recurring journal line to several accounts and dimensions. Allocation acts as balancing account line for the recurring journal line.

Like a recurring journal, you enter an allocation one time and it stays in the allocation journal after posting. You don't need to enter amounts and allocations every time you post the recurring journal line.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use allocation accounts in journal batches that have an approval workflow for creating journal lines.

If the recurring method in the recurring journal is set to **Balance** or **Reversing Balance**, dimension value codes in the recurring journal are disregarded when the account is set to zero. If you allocate a recurring line to dimension values on the **Allocations** page, only one reversing entry is created.

> [!NOTE]
> If you allocate a recurring journal line that contains a dimension value code, don't enter the same code on the **Allocations** page. If you do, the dimension values will be incorrect.  

To allocate recurring journal amounts based on dimensions, set the **Recurring Method** field to **Balance by Dimension** or **Reversing Balance by Dimension**. If the recurring method in the recurring journal is set to **Balance by Dimension** or **Reversing Balance by Dimension**, dimension value codes in the recurring journal are considered when the account is set to zero. If you allocate a recurring line to dimension values on the **Allocations** page, reversing entries are created that match the number of dimension value combinations that the balance is comprised of. If you allocate account balance through a recurring journal that contains a dimension value code, remember to use **Balance by Dimension** or **Reversing Balance by Dimension** to ensure that the dimension values are correctly balanced or reversed from the source account.  

For example, your company has a couple of business units and a handful of departments that your controllers set up as dimensions. To speed up the purchase invoice entry process, you decide to require the accounts payable clerks to enter only business unit dimensions. Since each business unit has specific allocation keys for the Department dimension, such as based on the number of employees, you can use the **BD Balance by Dimension** or **RBD Reversing Balance by Dimension** recurring methods to reallocate expenses for each business unit to the right departments based on the allocation keys.  

> [!NOTE]
> Dimensions that you set on allocation lines are not automatically calculated, and you must specify which dimension values must be set on the allocation accounts. In case you want to preserve the link between the source account dimension and the allocation account dimension, we recommend that you use the [Cost Accounting](finance-about-cost-accounting.md) capabilities instead.

#### Example: Allocating Rent Payments to Different Departments

You pay rent monthly, so you enter the amount on the cash account on a recurring journal line. On the **Allocations** page, you can use the Department dimension to divide the expense among several departments. For example, according to the number of square feet that each department occupies. The calculation is based on the allocation percentage on each line. You can allocate in different ways:

* Enter different accounts on different allocation lines to divide rental expense among several accounts.
* Enter the same account but use different dimension value codes for the Department dimension on each line.

[!INCLUDE [rev-general-journal](includes/rev-general-journal.md)]

### Calculate the reversal date

When using recurring general journals to post accruals at the end of a period, it's important to have full control over reversal entries. On the **Recurring General Journals** page, the **Reversal Date Calculation** field lets you control the date that reversal entries are posted when reversal recurring methods are used.

#### Example

Accruals are typically posted with **Fixed**, **Variable**, or **Balance** recurring methods on the journal line. The posting date of the posted amount on the account on journal line is calculated using the recurring frequency. The posting date for the balancing entry is calculated using the **Reversal Date Calculation** field, as follows:

* If the field is blank, the balancing entry will be posted the next day.
* If the field contains a date formula (for example, **5D** for five days), the balancing entry is posted with a posting date calculated using the reversal date calculation.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the **Reversal Date Calculation** field is not available on the **Recurring General Journals** page. To use the field, you must add it by personalizing the page. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Work with standard journals

When you create journal lines that you know you're likely to create again later, you can save them as a standard journal before you post the journal. The same applies for item journals and general journals.

> [!NOTE]
> Standard journals might not contain all of the fields you want to include in the resulting ledger entries. For example, if you're using a standard general journal to register a payment, the ledger entries won't contain the Payment Method Code field.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedures refer to the item journal, but the information also applies to the general journal.

### To save a standard journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter one or more journal lines.
3. Select the journal lines that you want to reuse.
4. Choose the **Save as Standard Journal** action.
5. In the **Save as Standard Item Journal** request page, define a new or existing standard item journal that the lines should be saved in.

    If you have one or more standard item journals, and you want to replace one of them with the new set of item journal lines, in the **Code** field, select the item journal.
6. Choose **OK** to verify that you want to replace the content of the existing standard item journal.
7. To save the values in the **Unit Amount** field of the standard item journal, choose the **Save Unit Amount** field.
8. To save the values in the **Quantity** field, choose the **Save Quantity** field.
9. Choose **OK** to save the standard item journal.

When you save the standard item journal, the Item Journal page displays so you can post it.

### To reuse a standard journal

> [!NOTE]
> Standard journals don't always have the same fields as general journals. When you use the Get Standard Journals action to copy the fields to the general journal, the general journal might have less information than if you created it manually. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Get Standard Journals** action.
3. To review a standard item journal before you select it for reuse, choose the **Show Journal** action.

    Changes you make in a standard item journal are implemented right away, and they'll be there next time you open or reuse the standard item journal. Be sure that the change is important enough to generally apply. Otherwise, make the specific change in the item journal after the standard item journal lines are added. See step 4.
4. On the **Standard Item Journals** page, select the standard item journal to reuse, and then choose **OK**.

    The item journal contains the lines you saved. If the item journal already has lines, the new lines appear after them.

    If you didn't turn on the **Save Unit Amount** toggle when you saved the journal, the **Unit Amount** field on lines added from the standard journal contain the value from the **Unit Cost** field on the item card.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you turned on the **Save Unit Amount** or **Save Quantity** toggles when you saved the journal, make sure the new values are correct before you post the item journal.
    >
    > If the inserted item journal lines contain saved unit amounts that you don't want to post, you can adjust it to the current value of the item.

5. Select the item journal lines you want to adjust, and then choose the **Recalculate Unit Amount** action. This action updates the Unit Amount field with the current unit cost of the item.
6. Choose the **Post** action.

## To renumber document numbers in journals

To avoid posting errors caused by the document number, you can use the **Renumber Document Numbers** action before you post a journal.

In all journals that are based on the general journal, the **Document No.** field is editable so that you can specify different document numbers for different journal lines or the same document number for related journal lines.

If the **No. Series** field on the journal batch is filled, then the posting function in general journals requires that the document number on individual or grouped journal lines be in sequential order. Just choose the **Renumber Document Numbers** action, and relevant **Document No.** fields are then updated. If related journal lines are grouped by document number before you used the function, they remain grouped, but might be assigned a different document number.  

This function also works on filtered views.

Renumbering document numbers respects related applications, such as a payment application made from the document on the journal line to a vendor account. Accordingly, the **Applies-to ID** and **Applies-to Doc. No.** fields are updated on the ledger entries.

### To renumber documents in journals

The following procedure is based on the **General Journals** page, but applies to all other journals that are based on the general journal, such as the **Payment Journals** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. When you're ready to post the journal, choose the **Renumber Document Numbers** action.

Values in the **Document No.** field are changed, where required, so that the document number on individual or grouped journal lines are in sequential order. After documents are renumbered, you can post the journal.

# Make payments

You pay vendors or customers, or reimburse your employees, by posting payment lines on the **Payment Journal** page. The payment journal is a general journal that's optimized for making payments, and offers lots of powerful actions. For example, the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action that finds vendor payments that are due, and the **Vendor - Summary Aging** report that shows an overview of due vendor payments.  

You can start the payment process from the lists, cards, and ledger entries for vendors, customers, and employees. Each of these pages has a button that starts the payment flow and helps you fill in the payment journal.  

From the payment journal, you can print computer checks or record when checks are written. If you select **Computer Check** in the **Bank Payment Type** field, you must print lines that represent checks before you can post the payment journal.

After you post payments, you can export them to a bank file you can upload to your bank for processing.

After the payments are made at your bank, you must apply them to their related open vendor or employee ledger entries. You can apply them manually or by importing a bank statement file and applying the payments automatically. To learn more, go to [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

### Find answers

The **Find it** section provides links to the most common places to find answers to your questions. The links fall into four categories and are explained in the following subsections. Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner can configure some of the links, and as a result the behavior can be slightly different.  

#### Product Help

The **Find it** section includes two links to product Help:

- Help about the page you were just viewing in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  

  This link is automatically generated. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can't find the relevant link, the [landing page on Microsoft Learn](index.yml) for the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is shown. For example, if the page was part of an app that didn't add context-sensitive Help mapping to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the *Learn link* defaults to the landing page.  
  
- Help landing page for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  

  The functionality in the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is described in the [Dynamics 365 Business Central documentation](/dynamics365/business-central) Learn more in the [Learn more using the product documentation](#learn-more-using-the-product-documentation) section. You can also extend and customize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with apps from AppSource. All apps provide links to the relevant product Help so that you can always find guidance for the different workflows in your version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

#### Community

In the [Business Central community forum](https://community.dynamics.com/forums/thread/?groupid=e78817ab-a926-4d31-96cc-aef040a4eb04), you can submit a question and learn from other [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] community members. Partners and Microsoft employees participate in the conversations.  

If you don't yet have a partner, the Community can also help you get unblocked if you have questions. For example, if you just signed up for a trial, the Community can be a great starting point.  

#### Blog

We talk about new capabilities on [the Dynamics 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/blog/business-leader/product/dynamics-365-business-central/), including any special considerations.  

#### Capabilities coming soon

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is updated with major feature updates every six months, and with monthly service updates. Choose the link to view the latest release plan. You can also get an overview of upcoming and recently released capabilities in [the release plans across Dynamics 365](/dynamics365/release-plans/).  

For the longer term overview, the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [roadmap page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/roadmap/business-central/) shows the general priorities for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the coming years.  

### Do more with your trial

This section gives you shortcuts to the Microsoft commercial marketplace where you can find solutions and services from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partners. Use the links to explore the full capabilities of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] before you decide if you want to buy a subscription. You can also find a link to contact the sales team.

> [!NOTE]
> This section is only available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online trial experiences. If you already bought [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the section isn't longer visible.

### Give feedback

Periodically, the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] team gathers feedback from our users about how satisfied they are with the product. In addition to ratings, you can also provide a written comment. By giving us specific and actionable comments, you help our engineering teams to prioritize the product improvements we invest in. You can also consent to be contacted about your comment. If you do, you're invited to a Teams meeting at a time that's convenient for you. You can provide product suggestions at any time on our [Dynamics 365 Ideas](https://aka.ms/bcideas) website.  

### Product suggestions

On the [Dynamics 365 Ideas site](https://aka.ms/bcideas) website, you can provide suggestions for new features and capabilities. Your input goes directly into Business Central's engineering backlog for investigation and prioritization.  

Make sure that you search through the list of submitted suggestions. There's a chance that someone already submitted something similar, and that entry might have already received votes. Vote if an idea already has been submitted to get it prioritized on the engineering backlog.  

### Troubleshooting

The **Troubleshooting** section shows technical information that your administrator or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner can use to unblock users. The section includes information about the latest error message, the current version of your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and a link to go to the **Page Inspection** page. Learn more in [Inspecting Pages in Business Central](across-inspect-page.md).  

To help you or your supporting partner troubleshoot, you can switch on additional logging in the **Report a Problem** section. You can then analyze the extra telemetry in the admin center or Application Insights, for example.  

As the internal administrator, you have access to the admin center where you can continue the troubleshooting. You can view telemetry, manage environments, and manage user sessions. The following articles in the administration content provide more information:

- [Finding technical information](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/manage-technical-support#finding-technical-information)  
- [Managing environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-environments)

- [Enable sending telemetry to Application Insights](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-enable-application-insights)  

### Report a problem

Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reselling partner helps you with technical support. This section makes it easy for you to contact your reselling partner, if they submit their support contact details. If your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner then can't resolve the problem, they raise a support ticket with Microsoft.  

Learn more in [Escalating support issues to Microsoft](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/manage-technical-support#escalating-support-issues-to-microsoft) in the administration content.  

> [!NOTE]
> With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the **Report a Problem** section is only available if you have paid for a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] subscription. If you have signed up for a trial and have not yet purchased [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you don't have a reselling partner, and you can't contact the Microsoft support team. You can find a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner on the [I'm looking for a solution provider](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2038145) page. Learn more in [How do I find a reselling partner?](/dynamics365/business-central/across-faq#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner).  
>
> With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, this section is only available in 2020 release wave 2 (version 18) and later.

### Support contacts

The **Report a problem** section displays an email address or a hyperlink for you to get in contact with the customer support person or team, like: Do you need technical support? Contact support at `someone@example.com` or `https://www.contoso.com`. 

> [!NOTE]
> If support contact details aren't present, it means that your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reselling partner hasn't provided the information. As a reslling partner, you set up the preferred support contact details in the admin center. Learn more in [Configuring the support experience](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/technical-support#configuring-the-support-experience) in the administration content.  

To alert your partner to a problem, choose the link to either send an email or open their support site in a new browser tab. You can then add the technical information about your Microsoft Entra tenant from the **Troubleshooting** section and any other information that you find relevant.  

> [!NOTE]
> The support contacts information isn't available with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

## Learn more using the product documentation

A large community of partners extend and customize the base version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Each partner and many customers deploy their own Help to their own website. But you can always go to the [Dynamics 365 Business Central documentation](index.yml) site to learn more. The site hosts different types of content, such as the following content:

- [Conceptual content about business functionality](welcome.md)  
- [Documentation for developers](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-dev-overview)  
- [Free learning paths and e-learning modules across multiple user profiles](/training/dynamics365/business-central?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs)  

In this section, you can learn about how to navigate the business functionality content.  

[!INCLUDE [ua-get-help](includes/ua-get-help.md)]

### Content on the site

[This section](welcome.md) of Microsoft Learn hosts content from Microsoft that represents the *Learn more* pillar in the user assistance model. In part, the *Learn more* content intends to answer those questions that the user interface can't answer, such as the following list:

- Where does this page fits into the bigger workflow?  
- What comes next?  
- What would be the alternative?  

From inside the product, you can access this content either through the *Learn more* link in tooltips and teaching tips, or by using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> keyboard shortcut.  

The navigation panel shows the table of contents that groups articles by business area. For example, you read the article [Purchase Items for a Sale](purchasing-how-purchase-products-sale.md), and then the table of contents shows you that there's also an article called [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-correct-cancel-unpaid-purchase-invoices.md). Both articles are in the group called *Purchasing*, which bundles articles that are related to the Purchasing module in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The table of contents includes a group of content that describes [local functionality](about-localization.md) for the countries/regions that Microsoft supports. If you don’t see your country/region listed there, it’s probably because a partner localizes your country/region. Learn more at [Country/regional availability and supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations).  

The local functionality content describes the capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that can help you be compliant in the supported markets, such as tax statements and other reports. In some cases, the difference between the default version and the specific country/region version is invisible to users. In other cases, users must set up reporting or electronic invoicing in a specific way. If you can't find a description of a certain button or action in the general section, you can hopefully find it in the *Local Functionality* section.  

> [!TIP]
> On the learn.microsoft.com site as well as in the in-product search field and in the Help pane, the search results show some context for the target article. The context includes the link that might show the name of a country, or a short description that calls out a certain capability or a country/region, for example.

### Find other content

If you land on an article that doesn't answer your question, you can find other content in two ways on Microsoft Learn:

- Use the **Filter by title** field in the table of contents on the left side of the website

  This way, you can filter by words used in the titles of the various articles. For example, type *invoice*, and then choose one of the offered links, such as [Set Up Invoice Rounding](finance-set-up-invoice-rounding.md) or [Create Prepayment Invoices](finance-how-to-create-prepayment-invoices.md).  

  Underneath each link, you can see where that article is in the table of contents. That way, you can easily see if the article is in the Purchasing section or in the section for Australian local functionality, for example.  
- Use the **Search** field in the top-right corner of the website

  This way, you can search for any term. The site then searches all the content for that term or expression. Search for *invoice* again, and scroll through the list of hundreds of articles in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] content that uses that word somewhere in the text.  

### Languages

Content about business functionality is published in several languages. When you land on Microsoft Learn from inside the product, you see the content in the same language as you specified in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], unless that language isn't available on Microsoft Learn.  

You can change the language by changing the URL, or you can use the language toggle in the bottom-left corner of the website.  

The content is authored in English and published to URLs with *en-us* as the language code. When new information is published in English, it's then sent off for translation into the supported languages. In some cases, you can't read this new content in your own language for up to four weeks, but in most cases it only takes a week or two. You can always view the latest information by switching the language to *en-us*.  

For each language, the table of contents is translated, but the content in the *Local Functionality* section is in English except for the country or region that corresponds to the current language. For example, in the Danish version of Microsoft Learn (`https://learn.microsoft.com/da-dk/dynamics365/business-central/`), you can see the entries for Australian local functionality in Danish in the table of contents, but the articles are in English. Only the articles for Danish local functionality are translated into Danish.  

### Recommended content

On Microsoft Learn, each article shows a pane with links to other articles. The **Recommended content** section is automatically generated based on how each article is used with the rest of the site. The links aren't static and change over time.

### Tell us what you think

With Microsoft Learn, each article has two buttons at the end of the article. The **This product** button sends you to the Ideas site, and the **This page** button lets you submit feedback about the content through GitHub. In both cases, you must create an account if you don't already have one. For *product feedback*, you must sign in with your work or organizational email account. For *access to GitHub*, you can use any email address when you create an account.  

We welcome your contributions, both as pull requests with suggestions or corrections to the content, and as GitHub Issues with bugs or questions. But be mindful that feedback and contributions to the *dynamics365smb-docs* repo is about the content, not about the product.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft accepts pull requests to the *dynamics365smb-docs* repo only, not the language-specific repos. If you have feedback about translations, you can report a GitHub issue in the relevant repo.  

### Navigate to other parts of the site

Microsoft Learn hosts content for other products and other types of content. Use the links at the top of the site to navigate to [Microsoft training](/training/dynamics365/business-central?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs) site or to the [Dynamics 365 release plans](/dynamics365/release-plans/), for example. You can also find a link to the
[Dynamics 365 Community](https://community.dynamics.com/) site, for example.  

## Apps and other solutions

If your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes functionality that isn't provided by Microsoft, then the provider of that functionality also provides *Learn more* content on their own website. You can access this content in the same way as in the default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as by using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> keyboard shortcut.  

The same applies if you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

# Managing Database Access Intent

As a super user or administrator, you can change the database access intent on reports, pages of the type API, and queries to improve performance of the service.

## Overview

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can be set up to use read-only replicas of the primary (read-write) database. Using the database replica reduces the load on the primary database. In some cases, it will also improve the performance when viewing data in the client. Replicas are beneficial for objects, like reports, queries, and API pages, that are used for viewing data only, not modifying data.

When objects run, the database access intent determines whether to use a read-only replica, if one is available, or the primary database. Reports, API pages, and queries are developed with a predefined database access intent (see [DatabaseAccessIntent property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-dataaccessintent-property)).

The **Database Access Intent List** page lets you override the predefined database access intent for objects when they're run.

In database terms, this feature is commonly known as *read scale-out*. For more information about read-scale out and data access intent in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], see [Utilizing Read Scale-Out for Better Performance](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/database-read-scale-out-overview) in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Developer and Administration help.

## To change the database access intent

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Database Access Intent List**, and then choose the related link.

    The page lists all reports, pages, and queries. The **Access Intent** column includes one of the following values:

    |**Setting**|**Description**|  
    |------------|-------------|  
    |**Default**|Indicates that the object uses the predefined database access intent.|
    |**Allow Write**|Sets the object to use the primary database, allowing the user to modify data.|
    |**Read Only**|Sets the object to use the database replica, which means that the user can only view data, not change data.|

2. Choose the **Edit List** action.

3. On the **Edit - Database Access Intent List** page, change the **Access Intent** field for the objects.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If an object that is editable, like the Customer Card, is set to **Read Only**, the primary database will still be used, regardless of the access intent, allowing users to make changes as normal.

# EU sales list in Germany

In Germany, the German EU sales list is submitted to the "Bundeszentralamt für Steuern" (BZSt) through the BZSt Online Portal by using the ELMA5 interface.  

In order to increase security, all types of taxes and tax reports must be submitted under an authentication method. Beginning in January 1, 2013, it's mandatory that you make submissions with authentication. To do so, you sign in with your BZSt number and private key using your pass phrase on the ELMA5 communications server. ELMA5 is designed to handle the transmission of large datasets of more than 1000 records. Following successful login, you can upload the data transfer in an interactive way. You can also set up the transfer to be automatic.

# Currency exchange rates in the German version

At the end of the fiscal year, you must adjust currency exchange rates for payables and receivables so that they're valued correctly in the annual balance. The **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job supports different valuation methods in order to meet legal requirements in Germany.  

## Valuation methods

According to the Bilanz Modernisierungs Gesetz (BilMoG), payables and receivables are valued differently depending on the difference between the reference date and the due date. This is managed by the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job where you can specify which valuation method to use. If the due date is less than one year after the reference date, the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job must be run using the lowest value valuation method.  

The following table describes the valuation methods.  

|Valuation method|Description|  
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**BilMoG (Germany)**|Beginning in 2010, each ledger entry is adjusted as follows:<br><br/>- If the due date is less than one year after the reference date, payable/receivable transactions are valued at the actual exchange rate.<br><br/>- If the due date is more than one year after the reference date, payable/receivable transactions are valued at the lowest value, with the possibility of appreciation in value (Wertaufholung) up to the initial value. <br><br/>**Note:** Ledger entries must contain a due date. An entry that doesn't have a due date is treated as a long term liability.|  
|**Lowest value**|Exchange rates are adjusted by using the lowest value of the two exchange rates. Currency losses are always calculated and posted. Currency gains are only calculated and posted up to the original local currency value of the transaction.<br><br/> This ensures that receivables aren't valued above their original posting amounts, and that payables aren't valued below their original posting amounts.|  
|**Standard**|Exchange rates are adjusted according to standard valuation principles. Full unrealized gains and losses are calculated and posted. If the transaction is partially applied, only the remaining amount is included in the adjustment. Learn more in [Adjust Exchange Rates](#valuation-methods).|  

German companies must use the **BilMoG (Germany)** option when they run the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job. This ensures that each transaction is adjusted using the appropriate valuation method as required in Germany. This also enables two fields in the request page, where you can specify the two dates that must be used to calculate the adjustment. The following table describes the fields.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Valuation Reference Date**|Specifies the base date that is used to calculate which entries are short-term entries.|  
|**Short term liabilities until**|Specifies the date that separates short-term entries from long-term entries. Short-term entries have a due date that is before or on this date. The default value is the value of the **Valuation Reference Date** field plus one year.|

# Create VAT reports in the German version

You can configure different types of VAT reports based on requirements. Then, when you have to submit a VAT report, you can create it on the **VAT Report** page and then export it in electronic format that conforms to the ELMA5 format requirements.  

## Create a VAT report  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Report**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Fill in the fields in the **General** FastTab, including the fields that are described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No.**|Specify the report number.<br><br/>Depending on the type of report, and the configuration in your company, you can use the automatically generated number, select a different number series, or enter a different number manually.|  
    |**VAT Report Type**|Select the appropriate VAT report type. The default setting is  **Standard**. If the report is an update to an existing report, choose **Corrective**.|  
    |**Trade Type**|Specify the type of trade that the report is to describe. The default is **Sales**. Other options are **Purchases** or **Both**.|  
    |**Start Date**|Specify the start date of the report period.|  
    |**End Date**|Specify the end date of the report period.|  
    |**EU Goods/Services**|Specify whether the report applies to **Goods**, **Services**, or both. The default is **Both**.|  
    |**Report Period Type**|Specify the time period that the report applies to:<br>- Month<br>- Quarter<br>- Year<br>- Bi-Monthly|  
    |**Report Period No.**|Specify the number of the VAT period.|  
    |**Report Year**|Specify the year that the VAT report covers.|  
    |**Processing Date**|Specify the date that the VAT report is created.|  

1. Fill in the fields in the **Sign-off** FastTab, including the key fields that are described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Sign-off Place**|Specify the location where the VAT report was signed off.|  
    |**Sign-off Date**|Specify the date when the VAT report is signed off.|  
    |**Signed by Employee No.**|Specify the number of the employee who signed the VAT report from the lookup list.|  
    |**Created by Employee No.**|Specify the number of the employee who created the VAT report from the lookup list.|  

1. Import the VAT ledger entries that must be included in the VAT report.  
1. Choose the **Suggest Lines** action.  

This adds VAT entries to the page. For each line, in the **Amount** field, you can drill down to see the VAT ledger entries that are the source of the line.  

After you create the VAT report, you have to submit it to the tax authorities.  

## Submit a VAT report  

1. On the **VAT Report** page, choose the **Release** action.  
1. Confirm that you want to release the report.  

    [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] validates that the VAT report is set up correctly. If the validation fails, the errors are shown on the **VAT Report Error Log** page so that you can make the appropriate changes. For example, an error displays if you try to release a standard VAT report but you have not yet added any lines to the report.  

    When you mark a VAT report as released, it becomes non-editable. If you must change the report after marking it as released, you must first reopen it.  

1. Choose the **Export** action to create a VAT report of EU Sales List data in ELMA5 format. Save a copy of the report, which has the required name specified by ELMA5.  

   You can now submit the report to the tax authorities.  

1. Choose the **Mark as Submitted** action.

# Print general ledger setup information in the German version

Before you use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] in the daily business, you can run the **G/L Setup Information** report to display the master data that you set up. For example, you can look over this master data, so that you would have a baseline to compare to, and then verify that you set up posting groups correctly.  

## Procedure to print

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **G/L Setup Information**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Setup Information** field, select the master data area as described in the following table.  

    |Option|Description|  
    |-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**G/L Setup - Company Data - Consolidation**|Displays tables for general ledger setup, company information, and business units.|  
    |**Posting Groups**|Displays customer posting group tables, vendor posting group tables, inventory posting group tables, and bank account posting group tables.|  
    |**Posting Matrix**|Displays general business posting group tables, general product posting group tables, and general posting group tables.|  
    |**VAT Setup**|Displays VAT business posting group tables, VAT product posting group tables, and VAT posting setup tables.|  
    |**Source Code - Reason Code**|Displays source tables, source code setup tables, and reason codes tables.|  
    |**Check Number Series**|Select to provide an overview of the use of number series so that you can identify number series that are problematic for the data export for the Grundsätze zum Datenzugriff und zur Prüfbarkeit digitaler Unterlagen (GDPdU). The report shows number series with one of the following issues:<br/>- The number series allows manual document numbers.<br/>- The number series isn't chronological.<br/>- The number series is used in more than one table or field.|  

1. Choose the **Print** button to print the report or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.

# Set up and export sales VAT advance notifications

A sales VAT advance notification is an XML file that you can use to report VAT to the German tax authorities on the Elektronische Steuererklärungen (ELSTER) online portal. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] generates an XML file with tax and base amounts, and information about your company in the format and layout that German tax authorities require.

> [!NOTE]
> Most of the functionality is included in the **ELSTER VAT Localization for Germany** extension. Make sure that this is installed in your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in [Customizing Business Central Online Using Extensions](../../ui-extensions.md).

## Process

To create valid sales VAT advance notification, you must set up the following information:  

- The company registration information and tax office information.  
- Basic sales VAT advance notification on the **Electronic VAT Decl. Setup** page.
- The VAT statement.  

### Set up company information

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Company Information** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   Specifically for sales VAT advance notifications, in the **VAT Representative** field, enter the contact person for VAT-related information.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

### Set up the electronic VAT declaration

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Electronic VAT Decl. Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----|
|**Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Nos.**|Choose the number series to assign identification numbers to new sales VAT advance notifications.|
|**Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Path**|Enter the path and name of the folder where you want to store the XML files.|
|**XML File Default Name**|Enter the name of the file.|

### Set up a VAT statement

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Statement**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **VAT Statement** page, in the **Name** field, choose the dropdown arrow.  
1. On the **VAT Statement Names** page, in the line for the appropriate VAT statement name, select the **Sales VAT Adv. Notification** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The VAT statement must have a VAT statement line for each key figure required by the tax authority, where the **Row No.** field contains the key figure and the **Amount Type** field specifies whether this is a base amount or a tax amount. Ask your tax office if you have questions concerning the key figures and their definition.

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

## Create an XML document

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Vat Advanced Notification List**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Sales Vat Advanced Notification List** page, choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!CAUTION]
    > If you submitted a sales VAT advance notification as a test notification by selecting the **Testversion** field, you can't change it into a real notification later. The tax authority doesn't accept the same XML file if it's submitted with the **Testversion** field cleared.

    Optionally, choose the **Preview statement** action to see a VAT statement that shows the data that is in the XML that you submit to the ELSTER portal. This view shows an amount for each element in the XML file in a human-readable format.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > In versions older than version 19.3 and other updates that are made available in January and February 2022, the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page shows fields and actions based on deprecated functionality in both the ELSTER portal and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. Specifically fields that are tied to stylesheets are no longer in use, because the ELSTER portal no longer provides such stylesheets.
1. Choose the **Create XML-File** action.
1. On the **Create XML - VAT Adv. Notif.** page, in the **XML-File** field, choose either the **Create** or the **Create and Export** option.  

    If you choose the **Create and Export** option, the XML file is generated and saved to your device. If you choose the **Create** option, data is generated in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] as an XML file when you choose the **Export** action on the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

After the sales VAT advance notification document is created, all fields in the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page can no longer be modified, except the **Description** field, because they define the content of the XML document. If you created an XML document and want to create a new XML document for the same period without transmitting the existing document to the tax authority, you must delete the existing XML file. Then, create the new document.

# Process for digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU)

You can export data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] according to the process for digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU), which is based on German tax law.  

## Overview  

Section 146 and 147 of the German Fiscal Code (Abgabenordnung, AO) allows tax authorities to assess the data of electronic accounting systems digitally. They may do this with a data storage device submitted to them or by direct or indirect access to the system. In the data storage device scenario, the tax liable company (or the person or entity entrusted with accounting and tax duties) must provide appropriate data storage devices with the data in computer-readable form. This means for the tax authorities that they'll be able to access at will all stored data, including the master data and connections with sort and filter functions. To provide data that can be used and evaluated in this manner, you must define and standardize the file formats for submission by data storage device.  

Tax authorities in Germany use analysis software, IDEA, which imports data from ASCII files. The IDEA software can import data in variable length or fixed length format. It requires an XML file, *index.xml*, that describes the structure of the data files.

## Defining GDPdU export data  

You can configure [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to export data to meet your needs. You can export large sets of data, and you can export small sets of data. You can export data from a single table or a table and related tables.  

For each data export, you define the tables and fields that you want to export. This depends on the auditor's requests. The selected information is exported to the ASCII files. A corresponding XML file, *INDEX.XML*, is also created to describe the ASCII file structure.  

The elements in the *INDEX.XML* file define the names of the tables and fields that are exported. Because the current auditing tool has restrictions on these field names, such as the length and the characters that are used, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] removes spaces and special characters and then truncates the names to match the 20 character limitation. You can change the suggested table and field names when you add fields to a table definition.  

In most cases, you set up GDPdU data export one time, and then a person in your company can run the export when the auditor requests new data. It's recommended that the setup is handled by people with an understanding of the database structure and the technical hardware in your company, but also in collaboration with people who understand the business data, such as the accountant.  

## Configuration  

You can set up different GDPdU data exports depending on the type of data that you want to be able to export. For example, you can create two GDPdU data exports:  

- One exports high-level information about all general ledger entries, customer ledger entries, vendor ledger entries, and VAT entries.  
- The other exports detailed information about the general ledger entries.  

> [!NOTE]  
> How to set up the GDPdU data exports depends on your company’s needs and the auditor’s requests.  

[Walkthrough: Exporting Data for a Digital Audit](walkthrough-exporting-data-for-a-digital-audit.md) provides an example of how to set up data exports for GDPdU.  

### Data export filters  

When you set up a data export, you can filter data on different levels as described in the following table.  

|Filter level|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Period filters**|You can specify a start date and end date for the data that is exported. You can then use this period filter to filter the data. For example, if you set a period filter for the export, you can then set table filters that use the period.|  
|**Table filters**|You can set filters on each table in the export. For example, you can include only open ledger entries, or entries that have a posting date in the specified filter. For example, you can also set a filter that is based on FlowFields, such as **Net Change (LCY)**, to only export customers where there's a change.<br><br>**Important:**  You can't set a table filter that is based on a FlowFilter.<br><br/> When you add table filters, you can increase performance by specifying the fields that the exported data will be sorted by the value of the **Key No.** field for the record definition. Which keys to use depends on the table. For example, if the table only has two key fields and relatively few entries, then the sort order doesn't affect the speed of the export. But for a table such as G/L Entry, the export is faster if you specify the key in advance, such as the `G/L Account No.,Posting Date` key. If you don't specify a key, then the primary key is used, which might not be the best choice.<br><br/>Other tables in which it can be useful to specify the key include the **Cust. Ledger Entry** and **Vendor Ledger Entry** tables.|  
|**FlowField filters**|You can include FlowFields in the export and set filters based on the period. For example, you can apply the period filter to the **Balance at Date** field on the **G/L Account** table.|  

If you include a FlowField such as the **Net Change (LCY)** field on the **Customer** table, you can specify that the entries must be filtered based on the remaining amount at the end date of the GDPdU period. If you add this as a field filter, then the calculation formulas are based on the dates that are specified during the export.

Learn more in [GDPdU Filter Examples](gdpdu-filter-examples.md).

## Export performance  

If you want to export large sets of data, it can take a long time. We recommend that you set up data exports based on advice from your tax advisor to establish your business needs, and the requirements of the tax auditor. The number of records in a table is also something that you should consider.

# Electronic invoicing in Germany

This article provides information on how to work with the German localization of the E-Document framework.

## E-Documents framework setup

Learn more in [Set up e-documents](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments.md), which provides information about setting up the E-Documents framework.

### Set up local formats  

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with version 26.3, the E-Document framework for the German localization supports all formats available in Germany: XRechnung (UBL only), Peppol BIS 3, and ZUGFeRD.  

To set up the format for the E-Document service, perform the following steps:  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link. The **E-Document Services** page displays.
1. On the **General** FastTab, select **New**. In the **Document Format** field, choose **PEPPOL BIS 3.0 DE**, **XRechnung** or **ZUGFeRD**.  
1. Configure the fields as described in [Set up e-documents](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments.md).
1. Close the page.

### Use buyer reference on the E-invoice

When you configure e-invoices in the sales process, make sure to display your buyer reference on the invoice. Follow these steps to set up how you use buyer references:  

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link. The **E-Document Services** page displays.
1. On the **Export** FastTab, select the **Buyer Reference Mandatory** field to specify whether the buyer reference is mandatory for the document.
1. Select where you use buyer references by choosing one of the options in the **Buyer Reference** field.  
   1. If you choose the **Your reference** option, you're required to populate the **Your reference** field on the sales document.
   1. If you choose the **Customer reference**, the system uses the **E-Invoice Routing No** from the **Customer** card.  
1. Close the page.

## Work with E-invoices

### Purchase process

Learn more in [Use e-documents in the purchase process](../../finance-how-use-edocuments-purchase.md), which provides information about the E-Documents framework in purchase processes.

To receive all three supported file formats, you must create a separate E-Document Service for each format and specify the desired format in the **Document Format** field. The process of receiving and creating e-documents is fully automated and requires no manual intervention. This includes ZUGFeRD, which is a PDF/A format—Business Central automatically extracts the embedded XML file and processes it as a new e-document.

> [!NOTE]
> Automated e-document creation doesn't imply automatic creation of purchase invoices. To enable this process, proper configuration is required, or, in the case of purchase orders, you must use purchase order matching.

### Sales process

Learn more in [Use e-documents in the sales process](../../finance-how-use-edocuments.md), which provides information about the E-Documents framework in sales processes.

Because there are three available file formats, you must decide whether to use one or multiple formats based on your sales process. You can define different workflows and specify the file format for each. Each **Document Sending Profile** supports only one file format, so you can't assign multiple formats to a single customer.

# Set up reports for VAT and Intrastat

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can specify which reports to use to create the documents that you must submit to the authorities, such as the VAT statement and the Intrastat form.  

## Set up reports for VAT

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Selections VAT**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Report Selection – VAT** page, in the **Usage** field, select the type of document that you want to specify reports for. This includes the VAT statement and the VAT statement schedule.  
1. Specify the report or batch job that must run when a user starts the activity for the document type that you specified in the **Usage** field. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Sequence**|Specifies where a report is in the printing order.|  
    |**Report ID**|Specifies the ID of the report that prints for this document type.|  
    |**Report Name**|Specifies the name of the report that prints for this document type. The **Report Name** field updates based on the selection in the **Report ID** field.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

### Set up reports for Intrastat

> [!NOTE]
> Intrastat reports can use either the XML or ASCII formats. Depending on the format you use, enter the material number in one of the following fields on the **Company  Information** page.  
>
> |Format|Fields|

# Declare VAT-VIES tax in the German version

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes the **EC Sales List** report, which you can use to submit information about sales transactions with other European Union (EU) countries/regions to the customs and tax authorities' list system. The report displays information in the same format that is used in the customs and tax authorities' declaration list.  

Depending on the volume of sales of goods or services to other EU countries/regions, you must submit monthly, bi-monthly, or quarterly declarations. If your company has sales of more than 100,000 euros per quarter, you must submit a monthly declaration. If your company has sales of less than 100,000 euros per quarter, you must submit a quarterly declaration. Learn more in [BZSt website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=204368).  

The report is based on the VAT Entry table.

# Walkthrough: Exporting data for a digital audit in the German version

You can export business data for auditing purposes. How the data export is set up is different for all companies, and you should ask your tax advisor and the tax auditor. The following walkthrough describes the end-to-end process, but it's an example only.  

The sample implementation illustrates a scenario where the auditor requests that you export data from your general ledger, and information about your customers and vendors. This isn't an example that is based on actual requirements from a tax auditor, but it serves to illustrate how to export data for a digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU) in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].  

## About this walkthrough

This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

- Setting up requirements for the data export.  
- Setting up the source for the data export.  
- Exporting data for the tax auditor.  

## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you need:  

- The German version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] with the CRONUS AG demonstration company.
- The *.DTD* file that is required according to the GDPdU. In this scenario, **gdpdu-01-08-2002.dtd**.  

## Story

Cassie, an accountant at CRONUS AG is notified by the company's tax auditor that they want to see a list of purchase and sales transactions in the first quarter of the calendar year 2013. Cassie knows the type of financial data that the auditor wants, but needs the help of Sean to set up the export.  

Sean is a power user with CRONUS AG and understands how the data is set up technically with tables and fields. Therefore, Sean usually helps Cassie set up the data exports for the auditors. From other data exports, Sean knows that the tool that the auditors use has some requirements on what the exported files must contain, but needs the help of Cassie to establish exactly which data is needed.  

## Defining the requirements

Cassie sets up the requirements for the data export. The auditors ask for transactions with customers and vendors. Therefore, Cassie knows that data is needed from the customer ledger, the vendor ledger, and the general ledger.  

### Set up the requirements for a data export  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Export**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Data Exports** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|The unique code for the data export, **AUDIT-Q113**.|  
    |**Description**|The description for the data export, **Data export for Q1 of CY 2013**.|  

    The **AUDIT-Q113** code is a container for the data export.  

    Next, Cassie adds descriptions of the kind of data needed in the export.  

1. On the **Data Exports** page, choose the **Record Definitions** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the **Record Code** field, and then, on the page that appears, choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Types** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|The code for the record type, **GLCUSTVEND**.|  
    |**Description**|The description for the record type, **G/L, Cust., Vend.**.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Record Code**|Select the record code, **GLCUSTVEND**.|  
    |**Description**|The description for the record type is added automatically, but you can change this to **General ledger, customers and vendors**, for example.|  
    |**Export Path**|Specify the path where the exported files are stored.<br><br/> In this scenario, **C:Exports**.|  

    If the specified folder doesn't exist, choose the **Yes** button to create it.  

Next, Cassie specifies the source for the data that are exported. Cassie knows from previous exports that data is needed from the following tables:  

- **G/L Account**  
- **Customer**  
- **Vendor**  

### Specify requirements for the source for the data export  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the **Record Source** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, in the **Table No.** field, enter **15**.  

   The **Table Name** field is automatically updated with the name of the **G/L Account** table.  

1. In the **Notes** part, choose the link, and then enter the following text:  

    **I need entries that show the affected accounts, the posting date, the balance, and the net change.**  

1. Repeat the two previous steps to add tables 18, **Customer**, and 23, **Vendor** to the data export record source.  

    For these tables, Cassie asks for data about each customer and vendor and detailed information about each transaction based on the customer ledger and the vendor ledger. Cassie also asks for the net change at the start of the period, during the period, and after the period that the data export is for.  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

Cassie has described the kind of data needed, and requests Sean for help with setting up the data export.  

## Setting up the source for the data export

Cassie and Sean talked about the requirements. Cassie explained the comments made for the first three tables in the record sources. The next day, Sean can complete the setup for the data export source.  

First, Sean adds the required *.dtd* file to the data export record definition.  

### Add a .dtd file to a record definition  

1. On the **Data Exports** page, choose the **AUDIT-Q113** data export, and then choose the **Record Definitions** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the line where the **Data Export Record Type Code** field is set to **GLCUSTVEND**, and then choose the **Import** action.  
1. On the **Import** page, navigate to the location of the relevant DTD file, and then choose the **Open** button.  

Next, Sean adds the **G/L Entry** table to the source and then adds fields from that table, and the **G/L Account** table.  

### Add the G/L Entry table to the data export record source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the line where the **Data Export Record Type Code** field is set to **GLCUSTVEND**, and then choose the **Record Source** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line under the line for the **G/L Account** table, and then choose the **New** action.  
1. In the **Table No.** field, enter **17**.  

   The **Table Name** field is automatically updated with the name of the **G/L Entry** table.  

1. Choose the **Indent** action.  

   This indents the **G/L Entry** table under the **G/L Account** table. Next, Sean adds a table relationship between the two tables.  

1. Choose the **Relationships** action.  
1. On the **Data Exp. Table Relationship** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**From Field No.**|Contains the number of the field in the parent table. In this scenario, the **No.** field on the **G/L Account** table.|  
    |**To Field No.**|Contains the number of the field in the parent table. In this scenario, the **G/L Account No.** field on the **G/L Entry** table.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

### Add fields from the G/L Account and G/L Entry tables to the data export record source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line for the **G/L Account** table, and then choose the **Add** action.  
1. Choose the following fields, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    |Field number|Field name|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|  
    |**4**|**Account Type.**|  
    |**31**|**Balance at Date**|  
    |**32**|**Net Change**|  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line for the **G/L Entry** table, and then in the **Fields** pane, in the toolbar, choose the **Add** action.  
1. Choose the following fields, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    |Field number|Field name|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**4**|**Posting Date**|  
    |**5**|**Document Type**|  
    |**17**|**Amount**|  

Sean added the **Posting Date** field from the **G/L Entry** table because Cassie needs the data to be filtered based on the posting date. Now, Sean uses the field to specify the field on the **G/L Entry** table that uses to calculate the period for the data export.  

### Add a period filter to a table in a data export source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line for the **G/L Entry** table, and then choose the **Period Field No.** field.  
1. On the **Data Exp. Field List** page, choose the **Posting Date** field, and then choose the **OK** button.  

   The **Data Exp. Field List** page is filtered to show only the date fields.  

This means that when Cassie exports the data and specifies the start date and the end date for the period that the auditors want, the export includes entries where the **Posting Date** field is between the specified start date and end date.  

Next, Sean adds the **Customer** and **Vendor** tables.  

### Add the Customer table  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Table No.**|**18**|  
    |**Export Table Name**|**Customer**|  
    |**Export File Name**|**Customer.txt**|  

1. In the **Fields** pane, in the toolbar, choose the **Add** action.  
1. Choose the following fields, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    |Field number|Field name|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|  
    |**21**|**Customer Posting Group**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|  
    |**61**|**Net Change (LCY)**|  

1. Repeat the previous two steps to add the **Balance (LCY)** field again.  
1. Choose the line for the first instance of the **Balance (LCY)** field, and then, in the **Datefilter Handling** field, choose **Startdate**.  
1. Choose the line for the second instance of the **Balance (LCY)** field, and then, in the **Datefilter Handling** field, choose **Enddate**.  
1. Choose the line for the **Net Change (LCY)** field, and then, in the **Datefilter Handling** field, choose **Startdate..Enddate**.  

    The following table describes the field values for the fields on the **Customer** table.  

    |**Field No.**|**Field Name**|**Field Class**|**Datefilter Handling**|**Export Field Name**|  
    |---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|**Normal**||**No**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|**Normal**||**Name**|  
    |**21**|**Customer Posting Group**|**Normal**||**CustomerPostingGroup**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Startdate**|**StartBalanceLCY**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Enddate**|**EndBalanceLCY**|  
    |**61**|**Net Change (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**Startdate..Enddate**|**NetChangeLCYPeriod**|  

    > [!TIP]  
    > To change the order of the fields, select a field, and then choose the **Move Up** or the  **Move Down** action.  

Sean added the **Customer** table to the data export source. Now, he adds the **Vendor** table.  

### Add the Vendor table  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Table No.**|**23**|  
    |**Export Table Name**|**Vendor**|  
    |**Export File Name**|**Vendor.txt**|  

1. Follow the steps in the previous procedure to add fields from the **Vendor** table to the data export source.  

    The following table describes the field values for the fields in the **Vendor** table.  

    |**Field No.**|**Field Name**|**Field Class**|**Datefilter Handling**|**Export Field Name**|  
    |---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|**Normal**||**No**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|**Normal**||**Name**|  
    |**21**|**Vendor Posting Group**|**Normal**||**VendorPostingGroup**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Startdate**|**StartBalanceLCY**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Enddate**|**EndBalanceLCY**|  
    |**61**|**Net Change (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**Startdate..Enddate**|**NetChangeLCYPeriod**|  

Sean almost completes the setup, but wants to verify that the data export source meets the technical requirements of the auditors' tool.  

### Validate the data export source  

Choose the **Validate** action.  

Sean now completes the setup of the data export based on the requirements from Cassie. Sean notifies Cassie to start exporting data for the tax auditors.  

## Exporting data for the tax auditors

Cassie wants to export data that can be sent to the tax auditors.  

### Export data  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Export Business Data**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Export Business Data** page, on the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Starting Date**|The start date. In this scenario, **01-01-2018**.|  
    |**Ending Date**|The end date. In this scenario, **03-31-2018**.|  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definition** FastTab, select filters as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Data Export Code**|In this scenario, **AUDIT-Q113**.|  
    |**Data Exp. Rec. Type Code**|In this scenario, **GLCUSTVEND**.|  

1. To export the data, choose the **OK** button.  

When the export is completed, Cassie is notified, and can now submit the exported files to the tax auditors. First, Cassie examines the files in the C:Exports folder on the computer. There's a file for each table, and the files have the names that Sean specified in the data export source. There's also an *INDEX.XML* file that describes the structure of the data export with the names of the tables and fields that Sean specified.  

## Next steps

When the tax auditors import Cassie's files into their software, they can read the data that was exported. If the auditors need a new version of the same data export, Cassie can run the export again.  

The next time the tax auditors request new data, Cassie, and Sean can collaborate to create a new data export.

# Correct VAT reports in the German version

If you have to submit a corrective VAT report or delete a submitted VAT report, you must create a new VAT report. According to the legislation, a corrective report must be submitted within a month of the initial report.  

When you create a corrective report, the report contains two line types per corrected line. In one line type, **Cancellation**, the base value of the VAT is reported as a cancellation. All other information remains the same, and can't be edited. On a new line, **Correction type**, you can make corrections as needed to the VAT amount. The **Suggest Lines** action, however, suggests the correct amount based on the filters and posted documents. You can't correct or modify the **VAT Registration No.**, each period being corrected needs its own corrective report.  

The **Suggest Lines** action recalculates the values to report. The **Correct Lines** action is used to make manual changes. You can combine the effects of the two actions to correct your report.  

## Example corrections scenarios

1. If you post additional VAT entries after you submit the Standard report in the report period, choose **Suggest Lines** in the **Process** group to get the updated amounts.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you manually changed the amount for a customer or vendor, this amount is overwritten when additional VAT entries are posted. Update the amount accordingly.  

1. If you want to change the amount of a report line that is submitted and no new VAT entries are posted, choose the  **Correct Lines** action. On the **VAT Report Lines** page, select the lines that you want to correct, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    For each entry, two lines are displayed: **Cancellation** and **Correction**. You can now change the amount on the **Correction line**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **Correct Lines** action doesn't suggest the amount based in VAT entries. If you have new VAT entries for the customer or vendor, instead use the **Suggest Lines** action.  

1. If you used the wrong filters, for example, the wrong VAT product posting group, choose the **Suggest Lines** action, and then set filters as needed.  

    **Suggest Lines** creates entries to account for the difference between the filters.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the updated filters exclude a customer or vendor, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates a Cancellation line for the previous reported amount and a Correction entry with amount 0.

## Correct a VAT report  

1. Create a new VAT report. Learn more in [Create VAT Reports](how-to-create-vat-reports.md).  
1. Fill in the fields in the **General** FastTab, and set the **VAT Report Type** field to **Corrective**.  
1. In the **Original Report No.** field, select the report that you want to correct. You can only select reports of type **Standard** that are marked as **Submitted**.  
1. Create your correction VAT report line entries.  

    Choose the **Suggest Lines** action. Set filters as needed.  

    On each line, you can drill down on the amounts to see which VAT entries make up the amount. Change the amount if needed. You can't edit, however, the **VAT Registration No.**.  

1. If the **Suggest Lines** action doesn't provide suggestions to correct the amounts that you intended, use the **Correct Lines** action to insert cancellation and correction lines for the customer or vendor.  
1. Continue with the VAT report creation process, and release the report.

# Set up data exports for a digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU) in the German Version

You must set up data export record sources to be able to export data for a digital audit according to the Grundsätze zum Datenzugriff und zur Prüfbarkeit digitaler Unterlagen (GDPdU). For each data export type, you must define one or more record sources, where each source is a table from which you want to export data.

> [!NOTE]  
> When someone opens **Data Exports** page for the first time, three data export records with predefined settings are created with the codes **GLAcc 2022**, **FAAcc 2022**, and **Item 2022**. Consider these data export records ready-made templates for exporting data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] according to government requirements.
>
> - **GLAcc 2022** can be used to export data related to G/L and personal data.
> - **FAAcc 2022** can be used to export data related to fixed asset data.
> - **Item 2022** can be used to export data related to item and invoice data.

## Set up a data export  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exports**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Data Exports** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |-----|-----------|  
    |**Code**|Specify the unique code for the data export, such as **Export-1**.|  
    |**Description**|Specify the description for the data export.|  

You must add record definitions to the data export. Each record definition represents a set of data that is exported.  

## Add a record definition to a digital audit definition group  

1. On the **Data Exports** page, choose the **Record Definitions** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |-----|-----------|  
    |**Data Export Code**|Select the data export code.<br><br/> If no data export code exists, you can create a new one.|  
    |**Description**|Specify the description for the record definition.|  
    |**Export Path**|Specify the path where the exported files are stored.|  

    Next, you must add the relevant *.dtd* file that is required according to the GDPdU, such as **gdpdu-01-08-2002.dtd**. If you must import a new DTD file to replace an existing file, you must first export the existing DTD file.  

1. Choose the **Import** action.  
1. On the **Import** page, navigate to the location of the relevant DTD file, and then choose the **Open** button.  

Next, you must specify the source for the data that is exported.  

## Add source tables to a data export  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the **Record Source** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Table No.**|Select the number of the main table to export data from.<br><br/> When you enter a value in the **Table No.** field, the **Table Name** field is updated.|  
    |**Export Table Name**|Optional. An archive file with the necessary data is created, containing an *INDEX.XML* file. You can change the suggested name of the table to be used in the `INDEX.XML` file during the export. The default name is the name of the table without special characters due to the requirements of the auditors' tool.<br><br/> **Tip:** In most cases, the **Export Table Name** and **Export File Name** fields are based on the same value.<br><br/> There may be cases where you specify exporting the same table more than once. You can choose different Export Table Names for each table entry, and the Export File Name is automatically adjusted to match. You can then change the Export File Name as long as it's unique.<br><br/> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically names the files as follows.<br><br/> **Table Name:** G/L Account<br><br/> **Export Table Name**: GLAccount<br><br/> **Export File Name:** GLAccount.txt<br><br/> **Table Name:** G/L Account<br><br/> **Export Table Name:** GLAccount1<br><br/> **Export File Name:** GLAccount1.txt|  
    |**Period Field No.**|Specify a filter for which date field is used in setting the start date and end date of the report.<br><br/> For example, if you select the **G/L Entry** table as your data export source, you can select one of the date fields that are available in that table.|  
    |**Table Filter**|Specify a field on which you want to set a filter.<br><br/> On the **Table Filter** page, enter filter settings in the **Field Filter** column.<br><br/> For example, you can specify a field that conveys information about the amount. You can also specify a date field and set a filter for it if you want to filter on a time period other than Start Date .. End Date. However, you can't specify a date field and set a filter for it if the same field is already used in the **Period Field No.**|  
    |**Date Filter Field No.**|Specify a date filter field if the table has one.<br><br/> If the table has more than one date filter, don't specify one in this field.|  
    |**Date Filter Handing**|Specify how the date filter is to be handled:<br><br/> - \<blank\>: No filter is set.<br><br/> - Period: Use the specified Start Date and End Date.<br><br/> - End Date Only: Use the batch job's End Date.<br><br/> - Start Date Only: Use the batch job's Start Date - 1.|  
    |**Export File Name**|Specify the name of the file that data from this table is exported to.<br><br/> For example, if the table is the **G/L Account** table, the value of the **Export Table Name** can be **GLAccount**, and the value of the **Export File Name** field can be **GLAccount.txt**.|  
    |**Key No.**|Optional. Specify the key field.|

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The INDEX.XML file contains table and field names in English based on the names of tables and fields. The names of tables and fields are defined in `<Name>` tags, and captions are defined in `<Description>` tags in the *INDEX.xml* file.
    > [!NOTE]  
    > Table and field names is written as-is, including any spaces, dots, parentheses, and so on. The only characters that are removed from the names are *&*, *'* (single quote), *"* (double quote), *<* (less-than sign), and *>* (greater-than sign).

    Learn more in [GDPdU Filter Examples](gdpdu-filter-examples.md).  

    Next, you must specify the fields that data is exported from.  

1. In the **Fields** pane, choose the **Add** action.  
1. On the **Data Exp. Field List** page, select one or more fields that you want to export, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    1. To change the order of the fields, choose the **Move Up** or the **Move Down** action.  
    1. To remove a field from the list of selected fields, choose the **Delete** action.  

You added the main table from which to export. Optionally, you can add one or more related tables.  

## Add related tables to a data export source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, in the line below the line for the main table, add the related table.  
1. Choose the **Indent** action.  
1. Select the indented table, and then choose the **Relationships** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Table Relation** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**From Field No.**|Contains the number of the field in the parent table. You can specify that this field is related to a field in the subordinate table.|  
    |**To Field No.**|Contains the number of the field in the subordinate table. You can specify that a field in the parent table is related to this field.|  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **From Field Name** and the **To Field Name** fields are populated automatically.  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

After you added tables and fields, you must validate that the structure of the data export source is correct.  

## Validate the data export source  

On the **Data Exp. Record Source** page, choose the **Validate** action.  

This validates the list of fields against the keys for the tables. If you select a primary key after you select a secondary key, an error message displays, and you must change the order of the fields in the **Fields** pane.

# Set up VAT reports in the German version

Information from various invoice types is used to feed data into the EU Sales List report. To file a VAT report under the ELMA5 system from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you need to set up report parameters.  

## Set up a VAT report  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Report Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **General** FastTab, select the **Modify Submitted Reports** checkbox to let users modify VAT reports that are submitted to the tax authorities.  

   If the field is left blank, users must create a corrective VAT report instead.  

1. Select the **Export Cancellation Lines** checkbox if you want to include information about cancellation lines when you export data for the VAT report of EU sales. Learn more in [Correct VAT Reports](how-to-correct-vat-reports.md).  
1. On the **Numbering** FastTab, specify the number series to be used for standard VAT reports. This will be the default numbering series that is used on any VAT Report that you then create.  

   Depending on the requirements, you can use the same number series for all VAT reports, or separate number series for each type of VAT report.

   For example, if your company uses separate number series for standard and corrective VAT reports, this number series is the default number series. Users can select a different number series in the **No.** field when they create corrective reports.  

1. On the **ZIVIT** FastTab, specify information for the fields.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.

# GoBD filter examples in the German version

This article provides examples of how you can use and combine different filter types when you set up your GoBD exports. Setting the right filters can improve system performance.  

The following examples use the **G/L Entry** and **Cust. Ledger Entry** tables for data. They assume that you specified the following dates in the **Export Business Data** batch job.  

- Start Date = 01/01/2013  
- End Date = 12/31/2013  

## Setting up export record source examples  

### Period Field No. field

The following table describes the setup on the **Data Export Record Source** page.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Period Field No.|Period Field Name|Table Filter|  
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|  
|**17**|G/L Entry|4|Posting Date|No filter set.|  
|**21**|Cust. Ledger Entry|4|Posting Date|No filter set.|  

Results of the export:

- G/L entries and customer ledger entries with posting dates between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  

### Table filter field

In this example, in addition to the **Period Field No.** information, you also specify a table filter. This filter is useful when you want to include other filters to specify more criteria, for example, amounts, in addition to starting and ending dates for your export.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Period Field No.|Period Field Name|Table Filter|  
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|  
|**17**|G/L Entry|4|Posting Date||  
|**21**|Cust. Ledger Entry|||Cust. Ledger Entry: **Posting Date=..31-12-13**|  

Results of the export:

- G/L entries with posting dates between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  
- Customer ledger entries with posting dates that are earlier than 01/01/2014.  

### Date Filter Field No. and Date Filter handling fields

The following example shows how to set date type **FlowFilters**. If a table has more than one date FlowFilter, you can't specify the one to use. However, you can specify how to handle the date filter.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Period Field No.|Period Field Name|Table Filter|Date Filter Handling|  
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------------------|  
|**18**|Customer|||Customer: **Net Change (LCY)**=<>0|**Period**|  
|**21**|Cust. Ledger Entry|4|Posting Date|Cust. Ledger Entry: **Remaining Amt. (LCY)**=<>0|**End Date Only**|  

Results of the export:

- Customers that have a **Net Change (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** in the period from 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  
- Customer ledger entries with posting dates between 01/01/2013 and 12/31/2013 that have a **Remaining Amt. (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** on 12/31/2013.  

### Date filter handling for the same table

In this example, you set multiple filter definitions for the same table.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Table Filter|Date Filter Handling|  
|---------------|----------------|------------------|--------------------------|  
|**18**|Customer|Customer: **Net Change (LCY)**=<>0|**Period**|  
|**18**|Customer|Customer: **Net Change (LCY)**=<>0|**Start Date Only**|  

Results of the export:

- Customers that have a **Net Change (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** in the period from 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  
- Customers that have a **Net Change (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** on the day before the start date.

# Export and print Intrastat reports

> [!NOTE]
> This article explains the old Intrastat Journals functionality, which is now deprecated.

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

Intrastat reporting is required throughout the European Union (EU) and must follow local requirements, such as specific formats and files. All companies in the EU must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. The movement of goods must be reported to the statistics authorities (Statistisches Bundesamt) every month, and a report must be delivered to the tax authorities.  

For Intrastat reporting, you must provide paper reports and files, which must be in ASCII format for Germany. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes reports and batch jobs that generate all of the information that must be sent to the German tax authorities.

# Direct debit using domiciliation

A domiciliation is a financial agreement between you and your customers, allowing you to automatically collect the payments for customer's invoices through a preferred bank account. Domiciliation can only be processed for domestic customers with domestic bank accounts. Domiciliation in foreign currencies or involving foreign banks aren't supported.  

Direct debit domiciliation is useful for companies with many customers or subscribers, such as a utility company or a publishing company.  

Before you can start using electronic banking for domiciliation, you must enter certain basic information.  

- **Domiciliation number** - This is a unique code obtained from the bank which identifies the domiciliation agreement between you, your customer, and the bank. The contract contains details regarding payment frequency, bank account numbers, and amounts. When you send your payments to the bank, the bank uses the domiciliation number to identify all parties involved.  

- **Preferred bank account** - The preferred bank account is suggested as a default bank account on all domiciliation suggestions for that customer. If necessary, you can change the bank account before posting the domiciliation suggestions. Learn more in [Generate Domiciliation Suggestions](/dynamics365/business-central/LocalFunctionality/Belgium/direct-debit-using-domiciliation).  

## Set up domiciliation

Before you can use electronic banking for domiciliation, you must enter the customer's domiciliation number and preferred bank account.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You should use one bank account per customer for all domiciliation.  

### Set up process

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the customer, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
`. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |-----|-----------|  
    |**Domiciliation**|Enter the domiciliation number for the customer. This number is used when you create domiciliation for this customer.|  
    |**Preferred Bank Account**|Enter the preferred bank account for transactions with this customer. This account is used when you create a payment suggestion for this customer.|  

## Generate domiciliation suggestions

After setting up domiciliation, you can start generating domiciliation suggestions. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can create domiciliation suggestions for domestic customers only.  

### Process

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Domiciliation Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
1. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch, and then choose the **Suggest Domiciliations** action.  
1. Fill in the fields as displayed in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Due Date**|Enter the due date to be included in the batch job. Only entries that have a due date before or on this date is included.|  
    |**Take Payment Discounts**|Select if you want the batch job to include customer ledger entries for which you can receive a payment discount.|  
    |**Payment Discount Date**|Enter the date that is used to calculate the payment discount.|  
    |**Select Possible Refunds**|Select if you want the batch job to include refunds.|  
    |**Posting Date**|Enter the date that appears as the posting date on the lines that the batch job inserts in the domiciliation journal.|  

1. Enter any additional filter criteria.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

When the batch job is finished, the domiciliation journal contains all open customer ledger entries that match the filters.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The domiciliation suggestions include only customers who have a Domiciliation number set up. Learn more in the [Set up domiciliation](#set-up-domiciliation) section.  

## Edit and delete domiciliation lines

After generating domiciliation suggestions, you might want to change the domiciliation lines. For example, you might want to reassign a bank account or prevent payment for a specific customer or customer ledger entry.  

After modifying the journal lines, print the **Domiciliation Journal - Test** report to test all journal lines.  

The **Suggest Domiciliations** batch job creates domiciliation suggestions for all customers matching the specified criteria.  

### Edit a journal line

# Limit the posting period in the Belgian version

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can limit the period by which posting is permitted on three different levels: **by company**, **by user**, and **by template**.  

Limiting posting periods can be useful when a company closes its sales journal at the end of each month. This keeps salespeople from registering sales documents from the previous month. At the same time, the purchase journal may stay open to register incoming purchase invoices from the previous month.  

When you post on the **General Journal Templates** page, the contents of the **Allow Posting From** field and **Allow Posting To** field are checked for a date interval. The date interval indicates when you can post to a journal template. If the field is blank, the **User Setup** page is checked for a date interval for the current user. If the **User Setup** page doesn't contain an interval, the **Allow Posting From** field and the **Allow Posting To** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page is checked for a date interval at the company level.  

## Limit posting periods by company  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. To specify the start of the period, choose the **Allow Posting From** field, and then enter the earliest date on which posting to the company is enabled.  
1. To specify the end of the period, choose the **Allow Posting To** field, and then enter the last date on which posting to the company is enabled.  

## Limit posting periods by user  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. To specify the start of the period, choose the **Allow Posting From** field, and then enter the earliest date on which the user can post to the company.  
1. To specify the end of the period, choose the **Allow Posting To** field, and then enter the last date the user will be able to post to the company.  

## Limit posting periods by template  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
1. To specify the start of the period, choose the **Allow Posting From** field, and then enter the earliest date on which the user can post to the company.  
1. To specify the end of the period, choose the **Allow Posting To** field, and then enter the last date the user will be able to post to the company.

# Belgian CODA bank statements in the Belgian version

The Coded Statement of Account (CODA) is a national banking standard, designed by the Belgian Banker's Association, which allows you to automatically process electronic bank statements.  

Each type of transaction in a CODA statement is assigned a unique code. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] uses this code to interpret transactions and apply them to the corresponding ledger entries.  

## Applying statement lines

When you have imported a CODA statement, you can apply the statement lines to existing ledger entries, based on the information in the **Transaction Coding** table.  

If the transaction coding of the statement line isn't found, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] stops processing and continues with the next statement line. If you select the **Default Posting** field, the statement line is used as a default posting.  

If the transaction coding of the statement line is found, the statement lines are matched to the following account types and corresponding account numbers:  

- **General ledger**: If the account type is a general ledger account, the statement line is posted on the corresponding general ledger account.  

-**Customer or vendor**: If the account type is customer or vendor, a matching customer or vendor ledger entry is found based on the following criteria:

  - If a ledger entry is found using the standard format, the ledger entry is matched to the statement line, and the application status is set to **Applied**. If the ledger entry doesn't use the standard format, the bank account number of the customer or vendor is used to find the customer or vendor.
  - If no ledger entry with a matching remaining amount is found, the customer or vendor account is used, and the application status is set to **Partly Applied**.
  - If the bank account number is used to find the customer or vendor, a matching ledger entry is found based on the amount of the statement line. If the amount is found, the statement line is matched to the corresponding ledger entry, and the application status is set to **Applied**.  
  - If the bank account number can't be used to find the customer or vendor, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] either stops processing the current line or uses the line as a default posting, before continuing with the next statement line.  

You can run the process as many times as you like. Only statement lines with a blank application status are applied.  

When you have applied all statement lines to a general ledger account or to a matching customer ledger entry or vendor ledger entry, you're ready to post the CODA statement lines. Learn more in [Automatically Transfer and Post CODA Statements](how-to-manually-transfer-and-post-coda-statements.md).  

## Extending the CODA integration

The current support for CODA bank statements can be used in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises. However, partners can't extend the capabilities in an app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] online. The code isn't deprecated but can only be extended or customized for on-premises deployments.

# Export payment files in the Belgian version

After printing a test report and correcting errors, you can export the payment journal lines to a payment file.  

A payment file contains either domestic, international, SEPA, or non-Euro SEPA payments. The file can be sent to a bank electronically. You can create only one file for each posting date and each currency code. When you export the payments to a file, an accompanying note is printed, which can also be sent to the bank.  

In the payment journal, the **Status** field on the exported lines is set to **Posted**.  

## Print a payment file  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter *Payment Journal*, and then choose the link to open the **EB Payment Journal** page.  
1. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch.  
1. In the **Export Protocol** field, select the export protocol.  

   Export protocols control which payment file is generated in the payment journal. You can have a mixture of export formats in a single batch, such as domestic, international, SEPA, or a combination of these. However, when exporting the payment lines to a file, you can use only one export format, or export protocol.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > By defining the export protocol, you also define the type of validation that is performed in the payment journal.
1. Enter the payment journal line information.

    1. Choose the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action.
    1. In the **Suggest Vendor Payments EB** page, set the relevant filters and options.

        This batch job processes open vendor ledger entries and creates a payment suggestion as lines in a payment journal. Open vendor ledger entries result from posting invoices and finance charge memos.

        Only the ledger entries of vendors where the **Suggest Payments** field is selected on their **Vendor** card are included in the batch job. The suggestions are registered in a payment journal. You must specify a last payment date that is used in the batch job.

        In addition, only vendor entries that aren't marked as **On Hold** in the **Vendor Ledger Entries** page are included in the batch job. You can also run the batch job so that it also includes payments for which you can obtain a discount.

        When you enter an available amount, the vendors are ordered by **Priority**.

        You can define what is included in the report by setting filters. To set additional fields on the tab, choose the field. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
    1. Delete or modify the lines as appropriate.
    1. If no bank account is indicated on the payment journal template, indicate a bank account to pay with on each line.
1. Choose the **Check Payment Lines** action.

    The **Export Check Error Logs** page displays any errors that exist. If there are errors, you must fix them before you can continue.

1. If there are no errors, choose the **Export Payment Lines** action.  

   The report that you specified in the relevant export protocol processes the payment lines and generates the file.

# Export intrastat third-party declarations in the Belgian version

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

In Belgium, you must have a third-party declarant fill out the Intrastat declaration. The third-party declarant must be an external person or company.

1. Choose the **Create File** action.  
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

   |Field|Description|  
   |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
   |**Nihil declaration**|Select if you don't have any trade transactions with European Union (EU) countries/regions and want to send an empty declaration.|  
   |**Counter party info**|Check this field to include counter party information in the Intrastat file (new requirement from 2019). The counter party information added to the file is taken from the **Country/Region of Origin Code** and **Partner ID** fields from the Intrastat Journal.|  
   |**Enterprise No./VAT Reg. No.**|Enter the enterprise or VAT registration number.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

Next, submit the declaration to the OneGate portal.

# Set up vendors for automatic payment suggestions in the Belgian version

You can set up each vendor so that unpaid invoices from that vendor are automatically included in payment suggestions. For each vendor, you must decide whether you want to automatically generate payment suggestions. If you don't want to generate payment suggestions for a vendor, you shouldn't select the **Suggest Payments** checkbox. This way the outstanding ledger entries for the vendor aren't included in payment suggestions.  

## Set up a vendor to be included in the payment suggestion batch  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Vendors** page, select a relevant vendor, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
1. Select the **Suggest Payments** checkbox.  

   If this field isn't selected, no payment suggestions are generated for the vendor.  

1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Make manual corrections to VAT in the Belgian version

You can make corrections to posted VAT entries without posting the correction into the VAT or general ledger entries. This is useful if you need to make a change to the total sales or purchases VAT amounts without changing the VAT base. For example, you can manually correct VAT if you receive an invoice from a vendor who has calculated VAT incorrectly.  

## Make manual corrections to VAT  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Statement Preview**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the line that needs to be corrected. You can make the VAT correction on both the **Row Totaling** and **VAT Entry Totaling** row **Type**.  
1. To make the correction, choose the **Correction Amount** field. The **Manual VAT Correction List** page opens.  
1. Choose the **Edit List** action. On the **Manual VAT Correction List** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Posting Date**|Enter the posting date of the VAT correction.|  
    |**Amount**|Enter the amount of the VAT correction. You must enter the correction amount, not the new amount. For example, if the amount is 1,000.00 and should be 1,200.00, enter 200.00.|  
    |**Additional-Currency Amount**|This field displays the amount of the VAT correction in the additional reporting currency.<br><br/> The field is automatically calculated, based on the contents of the **Amount** field and the current exchange rate.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  
1. Refresh the **VAT Statement Preview** page to see your corrections.  
1. To view a report related to the preview of the VAT information, choose one of the following actions:  

    |Action|Description|  
    |------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Detailed Report**|Opens the **VAT Statement** report. Learn more in VAT Statement.|  
    |**Form/Intervat Declaration**|Opens the **VAT – Form** report.<br><br/> The **Form/Intervat Declaration** report is based on the VAT Statement template that is defined in the general ledger setup. Therefore, it might export data that isn't the same as what is shown on the **VAT Statement Preview** page.|  
    |**Declaration Summary Report**|Opens the **VAT Statement Summary** report.|

# Test electronic payments in the Belgian version

After you set up electronic banking and generated payment suggestions, you can test the payment journal lines for errors before posting them.  

Some of the information that is validated includes:  

- Whether bank account numbers are valid.  
- Whether positive payment lines are present.  
- Whether domestic and international payments are made from only one bank account.  
- Whether only one bank account can be used for Interbanks Standards Association Belgium (Isabel).  
- Whether payment lines are in euro for Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).  
- Whether a number series is defined for SEPA.  

You can view any errors on the **Export Check Error Logs** page.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You have to correct all errors before you can post the lines.  

## Test payment journal lines  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the link to open the **EB Payment Journals** page.  
1. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch.  
1. In the **Export Protocol** field, select the export protocol.  
1. Enter the payment journal line information, and then choose the **Check Payment Lines** action to validate the payment journal lines. The validation that is performed on the journal lines depends on the type of check that is specified on the **Export Protocols** page.

# Set up export protocols in the Belgian version

Before you can use electronic banking, you must set up export protocols. Export protocols define the file format that is generated when you export payment history to be processed by the bank. Each line contains an export protocol identified by a code and a description. You can set up as many export protocols as necessary. You must set up an export protocol for domestic payments, international payments, SEPA payments, and non-Euro SEPA payments.  

 With export protocols, you can assign the codeunit that defines the check that should be performed before exporting the payment lines to a file and the report that defines the payment format. For example, you might have an export protocol named **DOM1**. This export protocol contains the **Check Domestic Payments** check codeunit and the **File Domestic Payments** report. Each export protocol has both a check codeunit and a matching report, as shown in the following table.  

|**Check Object ID**|**Export Object ID**|  
|-------------------------|--------------------------|  
|2000002 Check Domestic Payments|Report 2000001 File Domestic Payments|  
|2000003 Check International Payments|Report 2000002 File International Payments|  
|2000004 Check SEPA Payments|Report 2000005 File SEPA Payments|  
|2000005 Check Non-Euro SEPA Payments|Report 2000006 File Non-Euro SEPA Payments|  
|2000007 Check SEPA 001.001.09 Payments|Report 2000008 File FCY SEPA 001.001.09 Payments|
|If you don't want this option, set it to zero; otherwise, select another option.|XMLport 1000 (SEPA pain.001.001.03 Payments)|  

 After you set up export protocols, you can use them in your electronic banking payment journals.  

## Setup process

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Export Protocols**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Export Protocols**  page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

   |Field|Description|

   |**Description**|Specify a description for the export protocol entry. You can enter a maximum of 50 characters, both numbers and letters.|  
   |**Code Expenses**|Specify the code that describes the type of expenses associated with the export protocol entry. Code expenses include **blank**, **SHA**, **BEN**, and **OUR**. For international payments, **SHA** is the default.|  
   |**Check Object ID**|Specify the identification number of the codeunit that you want to use to perform a check on the object before the payment file is exported.|  
   |**Check Object Name**|Specify the name of a verification process that is used to perform a check on the object before the payment file is exported. After you select the **Check Object ID**, this field will display the **Check Object Name**.|  
   |**Export Object Type**|Specify the type of the object that defines the export format of the payment file export. After you select the **Export Object ID**, this field displays the **Export Object Type**.<br><br/> **NOTE:** To set up the export protocol for SEPA pain.001.001.03, select **XMLPort**.|  
   |**Export Object ID**|Specify the identification number of the object that defines the export format of the payment file export. For example, if you select **2000002**, the export format for the payment file is **File International Payments**.<br><br/> **NOTE:** To set up the export protocol for SEPA pain.001.001.03, select XMLport **1000**.|  
   |**Export No. Series**|Specify the number series that is used to assign identification numbers to the payment file export.|  
   |**Grouped Payment**|Specifies if this export protocol is used for grouped payments.|

# Set up declaration types in the Belgian version

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], there are two types of declaration:  

- Simplified declaration  
- Extended declaration  

The type of declaration depends on the amount of shipped or received goods. To determine the type of declaration that you should use, visit the [National Bank of Belgium](https://aka.ms/BelgianNationalBank) website.  

When using the extended declaration, also, you need to set up an Incoterm in Intrastat Declaration for each shipping method. If you don't see the **Incoterm in Intrastat Decl.** field on the **Shipment Method** page, you might need to customize the page and add the field.

## Set up declaration types  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the **Simplified Intrastat Decl.** checkbox to set up a simplified declaration type. Clear this field to use extended declaration.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Belgian VAT

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes Belgian extensions to the VAT reporting capabilities so that you can print VAT transaction details. You must send the following reports to the Belgian tax authorities:  

- **Monthly/Quarterly declaration**: Use this report to create monthly or quarterly VAT declarations, depending on your company revenue.  

- **VAT annual listing (on paper/disk)**: Use this report to annually report all amounts invoiced for both goods and services to all Belgian companies with a registered VAT number.  

- **EC sales list**: Use this report to report the sales of goods to other countries/regions in the European Union. Learn more in [About the EC Sales List Report](../../finance-how-report-vat.md#ecsaleslist).  

You're also required to provide a printed statement detailing the VAT transactions to the Belgian tax authorities.

## Nondeductible VAT

In Belgium, VAT can be fully or partially deductible. Expenses such as representation cost or purchases of cars are only partially deductible, and the transaction must specify how much of the VAT is nondeductible. For example, you create a general ledger account for fixed assets such as cars, and another account for representation cost. For each account, you specify how much of the reported VAT is nondeductible by setting the **Percentage Non deductible VAT** field. Then, when you post a transaction, the deductible VAT posts to the corresponding VAT account. The nondeductible VAT is added to the base amount and posted to the same account as a tangible or intangible asset.  

For fixed assets, the nondeductible VAT depreciates just like the base acquisition cost of the fixed asset. You must set up separate fixed asset posting groups for each percentage of nondeductible VAT. You must do so because each fixed asset posting group posts to a general ledger account where the **Percentage Non deductible VAT** field specifies how much VAT must post to the same account as the fixed asset.  

If you select the **Incl. Non Deductible VAT** field in a VAT statement line, nondeductible VAT is included in the VAT amount. The **Calc. and Post VAT Settlement** report adds the nondeductible part of that amount to the **Non Ded. VAT Amount** and **Non Ded. Source Curr. VAT Amt.** fields in the resulting VAT entries.  

## Multiple VAT numbers for customers

The feature for using multiple VAT registration numbers for customers, including adding different **VAT Registration Numbers**, **VAT Business Posting Groups**, and **General Business Posting Groups** for addresses in another country, are available in the Belgian localization. Learn more in [Multiple VAT registration numbers](../../finance-how-use-multiple-vat-registrations.md).

In addition to different **VAT Registration Numbers**, **VAT Business Posting Groups**, and **General Business Posting Groups**, businesses using the Belgian localization also need to work with the **Enterprise No.**. When you open the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** page, you can add the **Enterprise No.** for the customer if their address is in another country. After you enter this information, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] does the following things when you're working with sales documents:  

- If the customer is from Belgium and the ship-to address is in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** comes from the **Customer** card.
- If the customer is from Belgium and the ship-to address isn't in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** is removed.
- If the customer isn't from Belgium and the ship-to address is in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** comes from the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** page.
- If the customer isn't from Belgium and the ship-to address isn't in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** isn't available.  

> [!NOTE]
> If there's a change in the **Enterprise No.** in a sales document, it displays on the **Confirm Alternative Customer VAT Registration** dialog.

# Make journal templates mandatory in the Belgian version

You can use journals to post purchase and sales documents and make other general ledger entries. Journal templates can then help you structure different types of entries. In the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify if journal templates are required in the current company.  

## Make journal templates required in a company

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **General** FastTab, select the **Journal Template Name Mandatory** field. This field specifies if users must specify a journal template when they post general ledger transactions.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the **Journal Template Name Mandatory** field isn't selected, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't use template names in the posted documents and entries.

## Use journal templates in sales and purchase documents

If your organization decides to switch on the **Journal Template Name Mandatory** field, you must configure which journal templates must be used as default in sales and purchase documents.

> [!TIP]  
> Before you post a transaction, you can change the suggested template name in the **Journal Template Name** field. This way, the transactions are assigned another document number, as defined by the template.

### Use journal templates in sales documents

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Journal Templates** FastTab, choose the journal templates you want to use as default for all sales documents.  

### Use journal templates in purchase documents

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Journal Templates** FastTab, choose the journal templates you want to use as default for all purchase documents.

# Summarizing payment lines and general journal lines in the Belgian version

Business Central summarizes payment lines and journal line across the following types of payments:  

- Domestic payments  
- International payments  
- SEPA payments  
- Non-Euro SEPA payments  

## How payment journal lines are transferred to the general journal

When you export the payment journal lines to a file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] transfers the payment journal lines to the specified general journal. By default, a general journal line is created for each payment journal line.  

The following two fields on the **Electronic Banking Setup** page affect how the payment lines are summarized:  

- **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines**  
- **Cut off Payment Message Texts**  

If you select the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox on the **Electronic Banking Setup** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] summarizes all payment journal lines for a specific vendor into one general journal line. The general description "Payment %1," where %1 is the vendor number, is used for the summarized journal line description. A separate payment line and a separate general journal line are created to handle:  

- Payment journal lines that contain partial payments, with both the **Partial Payment** and the **Separate Line** fields selected.  
- Payment journal lines that contain a standard format message (passes the MOD97 test), which sets **Standard Format Message** to True in the electronic banking journal.

## Example 1

In this example, you export payment lines, and the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox is selected. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates:  

- One combined payment line in an XML file that has a concatenated payment message. White space is the delimiter.  
- One payment line in the general journal with a generic description that includes the vendor name.  

## Example 2

In this example, you export payment lines, and the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox is selected. The **Cut off Payment Message Texts** checkbox is cleared, and the combined SEPA and non-Euro SEPA payment lines exceed 140 characters in the payment message. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates:  

- Two combined payment lines in an XML file. The first payment line contains the first concatenated payment messages. The second payment line contains the payment message from the third line.  
- One payment line in the general journal with a generic description that includes the vendor name.  

## Example 3

In this example, you export payment lines, and the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox is selected. The **Cut off Payment Message Texts** checkbox is also selected, and the combined SEPA and non-SEPA payment lines exceed 140 characters in the payment message. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates:  

- One combined payment line in an XML file that has two concatenated payment messages. An ellipsis (…) is used to indicate that the message is truncated.  
- One payment line in the general journal with a generic description that includes the vendor name.  

Based on the XML structure, the payments are summarized per account number, beneficiary bank account number, and bank account number. The bank account filter can be empty.  

The EndToEndId in the SEPA message is taken from the payment message and can be truncated to the maximum length of 45 characters.

# SEPA payments in the Belgian version

The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) unifies payment methods in participating European countries/regions. This makes international payments as easy to process as domestic payments. Regardless of location, European citizens and companies can make and receive payments in euros, whether within or across national/regional borders, with the same basic conditions, rights, and obligations.

# Belgian electronic banking

In the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can exchange data with Belgian financial institutions  electronically. This speeds up processing time and helps avoid errors caused by manual data entry or processing.  

You can use electronic banking to perform the following functions:  

- Send electronic payments.  
- Process bank statements with CODA.  
- Process direct debits with domiciliation.  

## Setup

Before you can process electronic payments and statements, you must set up electronic banking in the **Electronic Banking Setup** page as described in the following table.

|Field|Description |
|-----|------------|
|**Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines**| Select to indicate if you want to group the payment journal lines for each vendor. Payments with a structured message aren't grouped. |
|**Cut off Payment Message Texts** |Select to indicate if you want to truncate long payment messages. Messages are truncated if greater than 106 characters for domestic payments and less than 140 characters for international payments. |

Learn more in [Summarizing Payment Lines and General Journal Lines](summarizing-payment-lines-and-general-journal-lines.md), which explains how the two fields affect the transfer of payment journal lines to the general journal.

# Enterprise numbers and branch numbers in the Belgian version

Companies receive a unique enterprise number and one or more branch numbers from the Belgian [Crossroads Bank for Enterprises](https://crossroadsbankenterprises.com/). These numbers are used in all correspondence to simplify communication with the Belgian administrative and legal authorities.  

## Enterprise numbers

The enterprise number replaces the existing VAT number. For existing companies with a VAT registration number, the enterprise number is set as the VAT registration number preceded by a leading zero. New companies receive a new enterprise number.  

The enterprise number is printed on the following documents:  

- Outgoing sales and purchase documents  
- Financial statements  
- Reminders and finance charge memos  
- Intrastat forms and files  

The enterprise number is set up in the following locations:  

- Company Information table  
- Contact card  
- Customer table  
- Vendor table  

## Branch numbers

A branch number is given to a company to identify an address where at least one of the company’s activities is exercised, for example, a workshop, office, warehouse, agency, or subsidiary. Unlike the enterprise number, there's no legal requirement to print the branch number.  

All branches of a company receive a unique number that is different from the enterprise number. The branch number is transferable to another company, such as after a merger or takeover.  

The branch number is set up in the following locations:  

- Company Information table  
- Location table

# Create payment journal templates and batches in the Belgian version

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], payment suggestions are generated and posted in payment journals. The structure of the payment journal is similar to the structure of other journal types. However, the payment journal contains some fields that are specific for processing payments. Before you can start generating payment suggestions, you have to set up a payment journal template and a payment journal batch.  

You can assign a specific page and a test report to each journal template. This way, you can manage your domestic and international payments from this adjusted page. The specified *source code* is copied to all the journal lines that are created based on the journal template. The code is also copied to the entries when they're posted. This way, you can always see where an entry is posted from.

If you assign a bank account to the payment journal template, the bank account is inserted on all payment journal batches and payment journal lines that are created by using this template. By specifying a bank account for the journal template, you can reduce the time that is required for checking the payment suggestions.  

## Create a payment journal template  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Payment Journal Templates** page, fill in the fields.  

   [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If the **Page ID** and **Test Report ID** fields aren't shown, you must add them through personalization. The fields must be filled in before you continue. Learn more in [Personalize Your Workspace](../../ui-personalization-user.md).
1. Repeat step 2 for any additional templates.
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

You can create multiple journal batches under each journal template. Several journals, each with its own name, can display the same page. For example, this can be practical if every user must have a dedicated journal.

## Add payment journal batches to the journal template  

1. On the **Payment Journal Templates** page, choose the **Batches** action.  
1. On the **Paym. Journal Batch** page, fill in the fields.  

   [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!NOTE]
   > To have the journal name update numerically, include a number in the journal batch name. For example, the name KBC1 increments by one number with every posting to KBC2, KBC3, and so on.  

   Next, you can test the configuration. Learn more in [Test Electronic Payments](how-to-test-electronic-payments.md).

# Belgian Intrastat reporting

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

Companies in the European Union (EU) are required to report trade with other countries/regions in the EU. This reporting process is through Intrastat reporting or VIES (VAT Information Exchange System). There are two types of Intrastat declarations:  

- Simplified declaration  
- Extended declaration  

To determine the type of declaration that you should use, visit the [National Bank of Belgium](https://aka.ms/BelgianNationalBank) website.  

## Submitting the Intrastat report

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can export the Intrastat declarations to a file that you can then submit to the OneGate portal. Learn more in [Export Intrastat Third-Party Declarations](how-to-export-intrastat-third-party-declararations.md).

# Belgian electronic payments

In the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can make the following types of electronic payments:  

|Electronic payment|Description|  
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Domestic|A local financial institution process these payments in the local currency (LCY) for beneficiaries who have accounts that have a local financial institution. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  
|International|A local financial institution process these payments that are either in foreign currencies or in LCY for beneficiaries who have accounts that have foreign financial institutions. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  
|SEPA|These payments are in Euro and are processed in countries/regions that accept SEPA payments. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  
|Non-Euro SEPA|These payments are in currency other than Euro and made to a country/region outside the European Economic Association (EEA). [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  

Because the standard for electronic payments is different for countries/regions, only financial institutions in Belgium can process electronic payments created in the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. The local financial institutions process the payment with the foreign institutions for international payments.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Credit memos can't be processed separately because payments must not have a negative balance. To process a credit memo, the credit memo must be added to one or more invoices by summarizing payments.  

Before you can make electronic payments, you must set up use electronic banking. Learn more in [Setup](belgian-electronic-banking.md#setup). You must also specify the relevant export protocols. Learn more in [Set Up Export Protocols](how-to-set-up-export-protocols.md).  

## Activate SEPA payments

[!INCLUDE [activate-sepa-payments](../includes/BENL/activate-sepa-payments.md)]

You can now make SEPA payments. Learn more in [Exporting Payments to a Bank File](../../finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file). If you don't use the AC Banking 365 capability, you can export payment journal lines to a file. Learn more in [Export Payment Files](how-to-print-payment-files.md).  

## File non-Euro SEPA payments

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can file non-Euro SEPA payments with the bank. This is useful when you make payments to other countries/regions that don't use SEPA and for currencies other than the Euro.  

Before you can file a non-Euro SEPA payment, you must complete the following administration tasks:  

1. Set up a new export protocol for a non-Euro SEPA.  
1. In the **Country/Region** table, clear the **SEPA Allowed** field for each country that belongs to the EEA zone.  
1. In the **General Ledger Setup** page, verify that the **Currency Euro** field is blank, and that the **SEPA Non-Euro Export** field is selected.  
1. Verify that the vendor's **Preferred Bank Account** field in the **Vendor** table contains the IBAN and SWIFT code.  

## File a non-Euro SEPA payment  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **File Non Euro SEPA Payments**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Journal Template Name**|Specify the general journal template for the non-Euro SEPA payment report.|  
    |**Journal Batch**|Specify the general journal batch for the non-Euro SEPA payment report.|  
    |**Post General Journal Lines**|Specify if you want to transfer the payment lines to the general ledger.|  
    |**Include Dimensions**|Enter the dimensions that you want to include in the non-Euro SEPA payment report. The option is available only if the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** field on the **Electronic Banking Setup** page is selected.|  
    |**Execution Date**|Enter an execution date if you want an execution date that differs from the posting date on the payment lines.|  
    |**File Name**|Enter the name of the file, including the drive and folder, to which you want to print the report.|  

## Correct payment lines

You must correct all errors before you can post the electronic payment lines. You can correct payment lines in the following ways.  

|Correction|Description|  
|----------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Add a payment journal line|If the payment journal already contains many lines and you want to add an additional line, you can enter the journal line manually. For example, if you want to reimburse a credit memo to a customer. These types of customer payments aren't suggested automatically by the **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job.|  
|Edit a payment journal line|If you don't assign a bank account to the payment journal or if you don't specify a preferred bank account on the Vendor card, you have to manually enter this information on each journal line before posting the journal. If you specify a bank account for a vendor, the bank account is copied to all payment journal lines for that vendor. Learn more in [Setup](belgian-electronic-banking.md#setup).|  
|Delete a payment journal line|The **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job creates payment suggestions for all vendors matching the specified criteria. If you want to prevent payment for a specific vendor ledger entry or vendor, you can delete the corresponding journal lines.|

# Payment scenario 2 - Foreign payment (FCY to FCY) in the Dutch version

You can use telebanking for trade with domestic and foreign customers and vendors. This article describes a scenario where the trade is with foreign customers and vendor that use the same foreign currency as your bank account is set up to use.  

The following list describes the main steps:  

1. Create Vendor/Customer.  
1. Create Vendor/Customer Bank Account.  
1. Create and Post Purchase Invoice for Vendor or Sales Invoice for Customer.  
1. Create Proposal.  
1. Create Payment History.  
1. Export Payment History.  
1. Import Bank Statement.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In the examples below, some standard CRONUS data is being used. Likewise, instead of creating a vendor/customer and a vendor/customer bank account you could use existing data.  

## Create vendor/customer

 Create vendor/customer and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with foreign currency payments for your foreign bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code as the vendor/customer itself.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To enter a bank account in the **Bank Account** vendor/customer bank accounts must be available. See below.  

### Example

Jannet Carter (code **JANNET**) is one of our US vendors. Purchase invoices are paid through our foreign bank account (code **ABN-USD**) to their bank account (code **JCBA**). Both bank account ABN-USD and JCBA are denominated in the same foreign currency (FCY) - that is, USD. Therefore, on Jannet Carter's vendor card, we set the **Currency Code** field to **USD**, fill the **Transaction Mode** field with **ABN-USD** that is linked to our bank account, ABN-USD, and set the **Bank Account** field to **JCBA**.  

## Create vendor/customer bank account

Create vendor/customer bank account and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Preferred Bank Account**: Enter a valid bank account number.  
- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Owner Information**: Make sure all owner information is entered.  

### Example

Jannet Carter's bank account (code **JCBA**) is denominated in foreign currency (FCY) - that is, USD. Therefore, on Jannet Carter's vendor bank account card, we enter a valid number in the **Bank Account No.** field, set the **Currency Code** field to **USD**, and fill the fields on the **Owner Information** tab with appropriate values.  

## Create and post purchase invoice for vendor or sales invoice for customer

Create a purchase/sales invoice and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with foreign currency payments for your foreign bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code is the vendor/customer itself.  

By default, these three fields are populated with values taken from the vendor/customer card.  

When the invoice is finished, it can be posted.  

### Example

When creating a purchase invoice for Jannet Carter, we enter **JANNET** in the **Buy-from Vendor No.** field. By default, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are populated with values taken from the Jannet Carter's vendor card. Therefore, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are **USD**, **ABN-USD**, and **JCBA** respectively. Nevertheless, these values can be changed.  

## Create proposal

Open the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page and browse to the bank through which we want to perform our payment. Open the **Proposal** page and generate payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job.  

### Example

Through the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page, we open the **Proposal** page for our bank, ABN-USD. Using the batch job, one proposal line is created for the purchase invoice we just created and posted for the vendor JANNET.  

## Create payment history

From the **Proposal** page we process our proposal into a payment history. The proposal disappears and can be found on the **Payment History Overview** page for the same bank.  

### Example

We process our proposal concerning the payment to the vendor JANNET and open the **Payment History Overview** page for our bank, ABN-USD. The last payment history is the one we created.  

## Export payment history

Open the **Payment History Overview** page, browse to the relevant payment history, and choose the **Export** action. The export batch job appears for the export protocol that is linked to this payment. For this export, the system already has entered appropriate filters. Check, if wanted, any of the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and then choose the **OK** button to export the payment. The system generates a text file using a filename as defined in the **Default File Names Field** field of the export protocol, which now is ready to be sent to our bank.  

### Example

As the transaction mode associated with our payment is ABN-USD, the **BBV** or **PAYMUL** batch job appear.  

## Import bank statement

After receiving electronic bank statements from our bank, we can import them by running the appropriate import protocol from the **Import Protocol List** page.  

### Example

Our bank sent us the bank statement containing our payment to Jannet Carter, ABN-USD. Therefore, we choose **OFFICE NET EXTRA** as the appropriate import protocol.

# Enter and post cash and bank/giro journals

The cash journal and the bank/giro journal help you post transactions into the system in an easier and more direct way than using the general journal.  

In conjunction with Telebanking, they allow you to import electronic bank statements into the **Bank/Giro Journal** page. The system can automatically reconcile these statements during the import process and determine whether a statement can be applied to open ledger entries for the relevant vendor/customer.

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can use the cash and bank journals to enter the transactions that affect the cash and bank accounts by using the **Cash Book** and **Bank Book** types.  

You can enter increases or decreases to the cash account on the **Cash Journal** page. For example, you can use this journal for paying out petty cash or receiving transfers from a different bank account.  

The **Bank/Giro Journal** page records the inflow or outflow of the cash to a specific bank account. This journal forms the basis for bank reconciliation. The layout of this journal resembles the paper bank statement, so you can transpose the required fields from the paper statement to the journal, or you can import an electronic bank statement file. The transactions can be customer payments or vendor payments.  

You can apply the payments from customers to the open invoices from accounts receivables. You can also enter general ledger transactions to capture miscellaneous amounts, such as bank charges or interest income. VAT codes can also be applied to these transaction lines. You can define a journal for every bank account.  

## Post cash journals  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Cash Journal** page, on the **Lines** FastTab, fill in the required fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Date**|The journal entry date.|  
    |**Document No.**|The document number for which journal entry is created.|  
    |**Account Type**|The account type to which the entry is to be posted.|  
    |**Account No.**|The account number to which the entry is to be posted.|  
    |**Description**|The description of the entry. This field automatically populates the description of the account number selected in the **Account No.** field.|  
    |**VAT Prod. Posting Group**|The VAT product posting group code used to post the entry. You can select a code in this field only if the **Account Type** is **G/L Account**. Learn more in VAT Product Posting Groups.|  
    |**Amount**|The total amount that the statement line consists of. You must enter the debit amount without a plus or minus sign and the credit amount with a minus sign.<br><br> If this amount includes the VAT amount, then select the **Amount incl. VAT** checkbox.|  

1. Choose the **Post** action.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > If there's a difference between the opening balance and the closing balance, you must change the closing balance before posting the entry.  

   The entries are posted to the general ledger. Learn more in **General Ledger Entries**.  

## Post bank or giro journals  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank/Giro Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. Select the relevant journal template, and then choose the **OK** button.  
1. On the **Bank/Giro Journal** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Opening Balance**|The current balance of the bank or giro account. It equals the closing balance of previously posted entries for the journal.|  
    |**Closing Balance**|The new closing balance of the journal.|  

1. On the **Lines** FastTab, fill in the required fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|

    |**Date**|The journal entry date.|  
    |**Account Type**|The account type to which the journal entry is to be posted.|  
    |**Account No.**|The account number to which the journal entry is to be posted.|  
    |**Identification**|The identification number that links the statement line to a payment history line.|  
    |**Description**|The description of the entry.|  
    |**VAT Prod. Posting Group**|The VAT product posting group code that is used when you post the entry on the statement line.|  
    |**Amount**|The total amount that the statement line consists of. You must enter the debit amount without a plus or minus sign and the credit amount with a minus sign.<br><br> If this amount includes the VAT amount, then select the **Amount incl. VAT** checkbox.|

# Required descriptions in G-L entry

When entering general journal lines on a form, the system automatically fills in the description field. This description is also stored in the G/L entry after posting the journal. For a good audit trail, a more detailed description is desirable, when you post a journal line of type G/L Account.  

To force the user to enter a more detailed description, it's possible to choose if the system must fill in automatically the description of the G/L account or leave the field blank. If the **Omit Default Descr. in Jnl. Field** checkbox on the **G/L Account Card** page is checked, the system doesn't fill in the **Description** field for that G/L account when selected in a general journal line.  

When posting the journal lines, the system checks if all the **Description** fields are filled in. If there's a blank description, an error message appears.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Leaving the description field blank and checking if all the description fields are filled in before posting will only be done on the general journal pages in several application areas and on the local Cash Bank Giro pages.

# Payment scenario 1 - Domestic payments (LCY to LCY) in the Dutch version

You can use telebanking for trade with domestic and foreign customers and vendors. This article describes a scenario where the trade is with domestic customers and vendors.  

The following list describes the main steps:  

1. Create Vendor/Customer.  
1. Create Vendor/Customer Bank Account.  
1. Create and Post Purchase Invoice for Vendor or Sales Invoice for Customer.  
1. Create Proposal.  
1. Create Payment History.  
1. Export Payment History.  
1. Import Bank Statement.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In the following examples, some standard CRONUS data is being used. Likewise, instead of creating a vendor/customer and a vendor/customer bank account, you can use existing data.  

## Create vendor/customer

Create vendor/customer and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Leave empty - that is, it's set to the local currency (LCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with local currency payments for your bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code as the vendor/customer itself.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To enter a bank account in the **Bank Account** vendor/customer bank accounts must be available. See below.  

### Example

Olek Johansson (code **OLEK**) is one of our local vendors. Purchase invoices are paid through our national bank account (code **ABN**) to their bank account (code **OJBA**). Both bank account ABN and OJBA are denominated in local currency (LCY). Therefore, on Olek Johansson's vendor card, we leave the **Currency Code** field empty, fill the **Transaction Mode** field with **ABN** that is linked to our bank account, ABN, and set the **Bank Account** field to **OJBA**.  

## Create vendor/customer bank account

Create vendor/customer bank account and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Preferred Bank Account**: Enter a valid bank account number.  
- **Currency Code**: Leave empty - that is, it's set to the local currency (LCY).  
- **Owner Information**: Be sure all owner information is entered.  

### Example

Olek Johansson's bank account (code **OJBA**) is denominated in local currency (LCY). Therefore, on Olek Johansson's vendor bank account card, we enter a valid number in the **Bank Account No.** field, leave the **Currency Code** field empty, and fill the fields on the **Owner Information** FastTab with appropriate values.  

## Create and post purchase invoice for vendor or sales invoice for customer

Create a purchase/sales invoice and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Leave empty - that is, it's set to the local currency (LCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with local currency payments for your bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code is the vendor/customer itself.  

By default these three fields are populated with values taken from the vendor/customer card.  

When the invoice is finished, it can be posted.  

### Example

When creating a purchase invoice for Olek Johansson, we enter **OLEK** in the **Buy-from Vendor No.** field. By default the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode** and **Bank Account** fields are populated with values taken from the Olek Johansson's vendor card. Therefore, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are **\<empty\>**, **ABN**, and **OJBA** respectively. Nevertheless, these values can be changed.  

## Create proposal

Open the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page and browse to the bank through which we want to perform our payment. Open the **Proposal** page and generate payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job.  

### Example

Through the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page, we open the **Proposal** page for our bank, ABN. Using the batch job, one proposal line is created for the purchase invoice we just created and posted for vendor OLEK.  

## Create payment history

From the **Proposal** page, we process our proposal into a payment history. The proposal disappears and can be found on the **Payment History Overview** page for the same bank.  

### Example

We process our proposal concerning the payment to vendor OLEK and open the **Payment History Overview** page for our bank, ABN. The last payment history is the one we created.  

## Export payment history

Open the **Payment History Overview** page, browse to the relevant payment history, and choose the **Export** action. The export batch job appears for the export protocol that is linked to this payment. For this export, the system already enters appropriate filters. Check, if wanted, any of the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and then choose the **OK** action to export the payment. The system generates a text file using a filename as defined in the **Default File Names Field** field of the export protocol, which now is ready to be sent to our bank.  

## Import bank statement

After receiving electronic bank statements from our bank, we can import them by running the appropriate import protocol from the **Import Protocol List** page.  

### Example

The bank statement containing our payment to Olek Johansson is sent to us by our bank, ABN. Therefore, we should choose **OFFICE NET EXTRA** as the appropriate import protocol.

# Payment scenarios

Based on a sales or purchase invoice or credit memo, a proposal can be generated and exported in order to  process it by our bank.  

Using telebanking you can deal with three scenarios:  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in your local currency (LCY), which is the same currency as linked to the invoice/credit memo. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 1 - Domestic Payments (LCY to LCY)](payment-scenario-1-domestic-payments-lcy-to-lcy-.md).  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in the same currency as the currency linked to the invoice/credit memo. Both foreign. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 2 - Foreign Payment (FCY to FCY)](payment-scenario-2-foreign-payment-fcy-to-fcy-.md).  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in your local currency (LCY), while the invoice/credit memo is linked to a foreign currency. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 3 - Foreign Payment (LCY  to FCY)](payment-scenario-3-foreign-payment-lcy-to-fcy-.md).

# Payment scenario 3 - Foreign payment (LCY  to FCY) in the Dutch version

You can use telebanking for trade with domestic and foreign customers and vendors. This article describes a scenario where the trade is with foreign customers and vendors that use a different currency than your local currency.  

1. Create Vendor/Customer.  
1. Create Vendor/Customer Bank Account.  
1. Create and Post Purchase Invoice for Vendor or Sales Invoice for Customer.  
1. Create Proposal.  
1. Create Payment History.  
1. Export Payment History.  
1. Import Bank Statement.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In the following examples, some standard CRONUS data is being used. Likewise, instead of creating a vendor/customer and a vendor/customer bank account you could use existing data.  

## Create vendor/customer

Create vendor/customer and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with foreign currency payments for your local bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code as the vendor/customer itself.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To enter a bank account in the **Bank Account**, vendor/customer bank accounts must be available. See below.  

### Example

Hernandez Ortiz (code **ORTIZ**) is one of our Mexican vendors. Purchase invoices are paid through our national bank account (code **ABN**) to their bank account (code **HOBA**). While our bank account ABN is denominated in local currency (LCY), Hernandez Ortiz's bank account HOBA is denominated in Mexican peso (MXN). Therefore, on Hernandez Ortiz's vendor card, we set the **Currency Code** field to **MXN**, fill the **Transaction Mode** field with **ABN** that is linked to our bank account, ABN, and set the **Bank Account** field to **HOBA**.  

## Create vendor/customer bank account

Create vendor/customer bank account and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Preferred Bank Account**: Enter a valid bank account number.  
- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Owner Information**: Be sure all owner information is entered.  

### Example

Hernandez Ortiz's bank account (code **HOBA**) is denominated in **MXN**. Therefore, on Hernandez Ortiz's vendor bank account card, we enter a valid number in the **Bank Account No.** field, set the **Currency Code** field to **MXN**, and fill the fields on the **Owner Information** FastTab with appropriate values.  

## Create and post purchase invoice for vendor or sales invoice for customer

Create a purchase/sales invoice and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with local currency payments for your local bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code is the vendor/customer itself.  

By default these three fields are populated with values taken from the vendor/customer card.  

When the invoice is finished, it can be posted.  

### Example

When creating a purchase invoice for Hernandez Ortiz, we enter **ORTIZ** in the **Buy-from Vendor No.** field. By default, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are populated with values taken from the Hernandez Ortiz's vendor card. Therefore, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are **MXN**, **ABN**, and **HOBA** respectively. Nevertheless, these values can be changed.  

## Create proposal

Open the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page and browse to the bank through which we want to perform our payment. Open the **Proposal** page and generate payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job.  

### Example

Through the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page, we open the **Proposal** page for our bank, ABN. Using the batch job, one proposal line is created for the purchase invoice we just created and posted for the vendor ORTIZ. The amount of the payment is in local currency (LCY).  

## Create payment history

From the **Proposal** page, we process our proposal into a payment history. The proposal disappears and can be found on the **Payment History Overview** page for the same bank.  

### Example

We process our proposal concerning the payment to the vendor ORTIZ and open the **Payment History Overview** page for our bank, ABN. The last payment history is the one we just created.  

## Export payment history

Open the **Payment History Overview** page, browse to the relevant payment history, and then choose the **Export** action. The export batch job appears for the export protocol that is linked to this payment. For this export, the system already has entered appropriate filters. Check, if wanted, any of the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and choose the **OK** button to export the payment. The system generates a text file using a filename as defined in the **Default File Names Field** field of the export protocol, which now is ready to be sent to our bank.  

### Example

As the transaction mode associated with our payment is **ABN**, the **BBV** or **PAYMUL** batch job appears.  

## Import bank statement

After receiving electronic bank statements from our bank, we can import them by running the appropriate import protocol from the **Import Protocol List** page.  

### Example

The bank statement containing our payment to Hernandez Ortiz is sent to us by our bank, ABN. Therefore, we should choose **OFFICE NET EXTRA** as the appropriate import protocol.

# Setting up electronic VAT and ICP declarations in the Dutch version

To create electronic VAT and ICP declarations and communicate with tax authorities, set up general information about electronic tax declarations. Your company must be registered with the tax authorities before you can send electronic declarations.

When electronic declarations are set up, you can begin to declare VAT and ICP to the tax authorities. Learn more in [Submitting Electronic VAT and ICP Declarations](electronic-vat-and-icp-declarations.md).  

## Set up electronic declarations  

Ensure that you've uploaded the certificates needed to communicate with Digipoort. Use the **Certificates** page to upload a client and a service certificate. When they're added to the list of certificates, you can continue with setting up electronics declarations.

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
1. If you want the contact ID in the electronic declaration to be filled with the VAT registration number of the company, then select  **Tax Payer** in the **VAT Contact Type** field.
1. If you want to send electronic ICP declarations for a subsidiary company of a fiscal entity, select the **Part of Fiscal Entity** checkbox.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > If a company has several companies registered as subsidiaries of a holding company, they have the option to submit the VAT declaration individually or combined for one fiscal entity. To set up electronic declarations for subsidiaries of a holding company, you must select the **Part of Fiscal Entity** field on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page. You can then create an electronic declaration for only one company.<br><br/>
   If you want to combine the tax information for all subsidiaries of a holding company, you must create a VAT statement on paper for each subsidiary company and manually calculate the total amounts for the holding company. These total amounts of the holding company must be entered on the website of the tax authorities.<br><br/>
   You can't combine tax information for ICP declarations. ICP declarations must always be submitted individually.<br><br/>
   For each subsidiary company, an electronic ICP declaration can be created and submitted to the tax authorities. These electronic ICP declarations must contain the VAT registration number of the subsidiary company and the value of the **Fiscal Entity No.** field on the **Company Information** page of the holding company.

1. On the **Digipoort** FastTab, set up the following configurations:
   - In the **Digipoort Delivery URL** field, specify the URL for the production version of the Digipoort Aanlever service. Learn more on [digipoort](https://www.logius.nl/producten/gegevensuitwisseling/digipoort).  
   - In the **Digipoort Status URL** field, specify the URL for the status information that is coming from the Digipoort Statusinformatie service. Learn more in [Electronic VAT and ICP Declarations](electronic-vat-and-icp-declarations.md).
   - Select **Use Certificate Setup** to specify that the certificate codes specified in the next step must be considered to transfer data to the information service.
   - In the **Client Certificate Code** field, specify the client certificate.
   - In the **Service Certificate Code** field, specify the service certificate.

1. To set up endpoints, add the endpoint URLs on the **Endpoints** FastTab.

   > [!NOTE]  
   > Endpoints set up is deployed to 21.1 tenants. However, all values are blank, but the Digipoort solution still works by taking hardcoded values if there are no values in the setup. In the 21.2 release, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically runs an upgrade.

# Docket reports in the Dutch version

The Dutch telebanking application allows you to combine ledger entries for the same customer or vendor, having the same transaction mode, into one payment or collection order to the bank. As such one total amount is paid to or collected from the vendor or customer involved. Possibly this combined payment could lack all detail information about the individual payments or collections. Telebanking offers you the possibility to inform your vendor or customer in detail by generating a docket report that describes the individual payments that constitute the total amount paid or collected.  

When generating payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job the system selects the **Docket** checkbox on the proposal in case that:  

- The resulting combined payment includes too many invoice numbers to list them in the available four description fields of the new proposal line: **Description 1** field, **Description 2** field, **Description 3** field, and **Description 4** field.  
- The payment isn't based upon an invoice.

# Single EURO Payments Area (SEPA)

The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) unifies payment methods in participating European countries/regions, making international payments as easy to process as domestic payments. 300 million European citizens and companies are able to make and receive payments in euros, whether within or across national/regional borders, with the same basic conditions, rights, and obligations, regardless of location.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports the Dutch requirements for submitting SEPA payments, credit transfers, and direct debit.  

Before you can submit vendor payments electronically in SEPA ISO2022 format, you must activate SEPA in the following pages:  

- Countries/Regions  
- Bank Accounts  
- Export Protocols  
- Transaction Modes  

Additionally you need to verify that vendor payment transaction modes and vendor bank accounts are set up to use SEPA for each vendor.  

Vendor payments made using SEPA ISO 20022 must comply with the following rules.  

- Make all payments in euros.  
- Make payments within the European Economic Area (EEA).  
- Use the vendor bank’s International Bank Account Number (IBAN) and Bank Identifier Code (BIC) information.

# Telebanking

Based on both sales and purchase transactions, telebanking enables you to generate your payments and collections and interchange them with your bank electronically. This includes the export of payment and collection data that need to be forwarded to the bank and the import of bank statements sent to you by the bank.  

## Transactions

In general, all financial interactions with vendors and customers are done through either purchase or sales invoices and credit memos. As soon as these transactions are registered and posted, payments, or collections can be carried out by your company.  

## Proposals

Based on vendor and customer ledger entries, telebanking enables you to generate payment and collection proposals. This can be done for any bank that is set up for your company. Both domestic and foreign payments and collections are possible.  

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to combine payments to or collections from the same bank account automatically.  

When a proposal is agreed upon, it should be processed into a payment history.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In general, for any open vendor and customer ledger entries, a proposal can be generated if it meets a number of criteria. Learn more in [Create Proposals](how-to-create-proposals.md).  

## Payment histories

A payment history is nothing more than a proposal except for the fact that data on a payment history can't be modified. The payment or collection data is ready to be exported and forwarded to the bank. Learn more in [Create and Export Payment History](how-to-create-and-export-payment-history.md).  

## Bank statements

For all your financial interactions through your bank, the bank can send you electronic bank statements. These statements can be imported into the Bank/Giro Journals. If you want, you can have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically reconcile these statements during this import process and determine whether a statement can be applied to open ledger entries for the relevant vendor/customer. Learn more in [Import and Reconcile Bank Statements](how-to-import-and-reconcile-bank-statements.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The currency of the imported transactions must match the currency that is specified on the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].

# Submitting electronic VAT and ICP declarations in the Dutch version

Companies must submit periodic VAT and Intracommunautaire leveringen (ICP) declarations to the tax authorities.  

- VAT declarations must be submitted on a monthly or quarterly basis.
- ICP declarations must be submitted on a quarterly basis.

> [!NOTE]  
> ICP declarations must be submitted by companies/regions that sell goods or services to European Union (EU) countries. Purchases aren't included in this declaration. <br><br/>
For a transaction to qualify for ICP, it's required that the merchandise crossed the border physically. It isn't enough that the location of an invoice address or the office of the vendor or customer is in another EU country or region.  

You can submit the VAT declarations and ICP declarations in the following ways:  

- Sign in to the website of the Dutch tax office and enter the information manually. Learn more on the [website](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/en/individuals/individuals) of the Dutch tax office.  
- Create an electronic declaration and submit the encrypted file through the Digipoort channel to the Dutch tax office. Digipoort is the electronic post office provided by the Dutch government for companies. It provides the common infrastructure for the communication of information between companies and the government, including VAT declarations. The reports are in the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) format. Learn more in [Create Reports with XBRL](../../bi-create-reports-with-xbrl.md).

## Prepare for electronic declaration

Before you can send electronic declarations to the tax authorities, you must perform the following tasks:

1. Ensure that you obtain the certificates from the government. If you haven't, take the following steps to obtain the certificates:

    - Obtain a PKIoverheid certificate for the company if you don't have one already. You can find a list of certificate providers on this [website](https://www.logius.nl/producten/toegang/pkioverheid/aansluiten/toegetreden-csps).  
    - You can register a user of Digipoort on this [website](https://aansluiten.procesinfrastructuur.nl/site/registratienieuw).
    - You can obtain a **Digipoort Service certificate**, on the [Dutch Tax Administration website](https://aansluiten.procesinfrastructuur.nl).

1. Enter general data and personal data received from the tax authorities on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page. Learn more in [Setting Up Electronic VAT and ICP Declarations](how-to-set-up-electronic-vat-and-icp-declarations.md).

1. Set up a VAT category code for all XML elements in the electronic VAT declaration. Learn more in [Set Up VAT Categories](how-to-set-up-vat-categories.md).

## Create an electronic declaration

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Declarations**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration List** page, choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
1. Choose the **OK** button.

The XML elements and the accompanying data of the electronic declaration are displayed on the **Lines** FastTab on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page.

The XBRL reporter ensures that all account numbers that are imported from Business Central are mapped to the XBRL elements in a report. The XBRL reporter also displays a list of errors of unmapped elements or accounts.

## Submit an electronic declaration

With the XBRL reporter, you can submit the Intracommunautaire Leveringen (ICP) declaration or the VAT declaration in the required XML format. When it's submitted, the file is sent to the tax authorities as defined on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page.

1. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page, choose the **Submit Electronic Tax Declaration** action.
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Client Certificate**|Select the **PKIoverheid** certificate for the company.|  
    |**Client Certificate Password**|Enter the password that encrypts the client certificate.|
    |**Service Certificate**|Select the **Digipoort Service** certificate.|

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

The electronic declaration is submitted to the tax authorities.

> [!NOTE]  
> If there are no intra-community deliveries in the declaration period, then an electronic ICP declaration is created without XML elements for the deliveries. If you submit such a declaration, an error message is displayed.

## Import a response message from the tax authorities

For each electronic declaration, the tax authorities send a response message. These messages must be received from the server of the tax authorities
and be processed. The first step is to import the response message into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Decl. Response Msgs.**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **Receive Response Messages** action.  
. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Client Certificate**|Select the **PKIoverheid** certificate for the company.|  
    |**Client Certificate Password**|Enter the password that encrypts the client certificate.|
    |**Service Certificate**|Select the **Digipoort Service** certificate.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.

## Process a response message from the tax authorities

When a response message is imported, it must be processed by validating its content against the related electronic declaration. If no errors are found in the electronic declaration and the data is processed by the tax authorities, then the **Status** field on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page is changed to **Acknowledgement**.

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Decl. Response Msgs.**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **Process Response Messages** action.  
1. On the **Process Response Messages Batch Job** page, select the appropriate filters, and then choose the **OK** button.  

   The processed information about the response message is displayed on the **Elec. Tax Decl. Response Msgs.**. page.  

1. To export a message or attachment, choose the **Export Response Message** action or the **Export Response Attachment** action.

# Dutch electronic banking

Electronic banking functionality allows you to create electronic payment files and direct debit files, and to import electronic bank statements from supported bank software.  

## Telebanking

Using Telebanking, you can export payments, import bank statements, and collect data to forward to the bank. Learn more in [Telebanking](telebanking.md).  

You can create payment proposals and reconcile bank accounts in the cash, bank, and giro journals.  

### Payment files

You can make payment proposals for paying open invoices to suppliers. Payment proposals can be edited manually prior to processing to add or remove payment invoices, or to change payment amounts. After processing a proposed payment batch, you can transfer electronic payment files to the bank. If an error occurs in the payment file while importing into the banking software, you can make a copy of the payment file to resubmit to the bank.  

You can make domestic payments and international payments using the designated formats. Learn more in [Telebanking](telebanking.md).  

### Direct debit files

You can create a payment proposal to collect payment from customer bank accounts. You can edit payment proposals manually to add or remove invoices, or to change collection amounts. After processing a proposed payment batch, you can transfer electronic direct debit files to the bank. If an error occurs in the direct debit file while importing into the banking software, you can make a copy of the direct debit file to resubmit to the bank.  

You can only collect payments domestically at this time. Learn more in [Create Proposals](how-to-create-proposals.md).  

### Bank statement import

You can import bank statements from supported bank software, and reconcile them with incoming and outgoing payments. You can also reconcile bank charges and interest earned.  

Learn more in [Import and Reconcile Bank Statements](how-to-import-and-reconcile-bank-statements.md).

# CMR notes in the Dutch version

A CMR note is a bill of lading or an international consignment note defined under the 1956 United Nations Convention for the Contract of the International Carriage of Goods by Road. This is also known as the CMR Convention.  

Claims with complete CMR note information are easily processed.  

## CMR notes

Countries/Regions that follow the CMR Convention adhere to a standard form for CMR notes. The type of CMR notes used depends on the type of transaction. There are three types:  

- **CMR - Sales Shipment** – This report is used to print CMR documents for sales shipments. For each CMR document, the report shows address data for the sender, shipping agent, and consignee, along with data about the shipped items.

- **CMR - Purchase Return Shipment** – This report is used to print CMR documents for purchase return shipments. For each CMR document, the report shows address data for the sender, shipping agent, and consignee, along with data about the shipped items.

- **CMR - Transfer Shipment** – This report is used to print CMR documents for transfer shipments. For each CMR document, the report shows address data for the location from which the items are shipped, the location to which the items are shipped, and information regarding the shipping agent, along with data about the shipped items.

> [!NOTE]  
> CMR notes are formatted to print on preprinted CMR forms.  

The following details the standard life cycle of a CMR note:  

- The warehouse manager prints the CMR notes for the shipments that need to be sent.  
- The shipments are then packed and handed to the truck driver, along with the CMR notes.  
- The driver ensures that each shipment has a CMR note.  
- When goods are delivered to the customers, the driver ensures that the customers sign the CMR notes.  
- The signed CMR notes are then given to the respective internal Accounts Receivable departments.  
- The Accounts Payable administrators receive the signed CMR notes, along with the invoice for freight forwarding services from the freight forwarder.

# Create an audit file for the tax authority in the Dutch version

During an examination of the books for a fiscal year, a tax inspector can ask for data about the basis transactions from the general ledger for that fiscal year. Basis transactions usually are processed via journal entries. That is the reason why the journal entries are the basis for the audit file.  

The tax authority stimulates companies to use the audit file but it isn't prescribed.  

The audit file can also be used to exchange data between companies. You can select every period you want, but the start and end date of the entered period must be in the same fiscal year.  

## Create an audit file  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Tax Authority - Audit File**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Start Date**|Specify the start date of the period on which the data must be based.|  
    |**End Date**|Specify the end date of the period on which the data must be based.|  
    |**Exclude Begin Balance**|Specifies if the audit file must contain the begin balance of general ledger accounts.<br><br/> The field is editable if the start date of the period is equal to the start date of a fiscal year.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button to create the audit file. If you don't want to create the audit file, choose the **Cancel** button to close the page.  

When you run the report, you must specify the name and location of the exported file. The default file name is **audit.xaf**, but you can change that. The file extension must be *.xaf*.
