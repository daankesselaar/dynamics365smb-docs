# Calculate order promising dates

A company must be able to inform their customers of order delivery dates. The **Order Promising Lines** page enables you to do this from a sales order.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates shipment and delivery dates based on an item’s known and expected availability dates, which you can promise to customers.  

If you specify a requested delivery date on a sales order line, then that date is used as the starting point for the following calculations:  

- requested delivery date - shipping time = planned shipment date  
- planned shipment date - outbound whse. handling time = shipment date  

If the items are available to pick on the shipment date, then the sales process can continue. If the items aren't available to be picked on the shipment date, then a stock-out warning is displayed.  

If you don't specify a requested delivery date on a sales order line, or if the requested delivery date can't be met, then the earliest date on which that the items are available is calculated. That date is then entered in the **Shipment Date** field on the line, and the date on which you plan to ship the items and the date on which they'll be delivered to the customer are calculated using the following calculations:  

- shipment date + outbound whse. handling time = planned shipment date  
- planned shipment date + shipping time = planned delivery date  

## About order promising

The Order Promising functionality enables you to promise an order to be shipped or delivered on a specific date. The date that an item is available to promise or capable to promise is calculated, and order lines are created for those dates that you accept. The functionality calculates the earliest possible date that an item is available for shipment or delivery. It also creates requisition lines, in case the items must first be purchased or produced, for those dates that you accept.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses two fundamental concepts:  

- Available to Promise (ATP)  
- Capable to Promise (CTP)  

### Available to promise

Available to promise (ATP) calculates dates based on the reservation system. It performs an availability check of the unreserved quantities in inventory about planned production, purchases, transfers, and sales returns. Based on this information, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the delivery date of the customer’s order because the items are available, either in inventory or on planned receipts.  

### Capable to promise

Capable to promise (CTP) assumes a “what if” scenario, which only applies to item quantities that aren't in inventory or on scheduled orders. Based on this scenario, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the earliest date that the item can be available if it's to be produced, purchased, or transferred.

#### Example

If there's an order for 10 pieces, and 6 pieces are available in inventory or on scheduled orders, then the capable to promise calculation will be based on 4 pieces.

### Calculations

When [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the customer’s delivery date, it performs two tasks:  

- Calculates the earliest delivery date when the customer hasn't requested a specific delivery date.  
- Verifies if the delivery date requested by the customer or promised to the customer is realistic.  

If the customer doesn't request a specific delivery date, the shipment date is set to equal the work date, and availability is then based on that date. If the item is in inventory, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates forward in time to determine when the order can be delivered. This is accomplished by the following formulas:  

- Shipment Date + Outbound Warehouse Handling Time = Planned Shipment Date  
- Planned Shipment Date + Shipping Time = Planned Delivery Date  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] then verifies if the calculated delivery date is realistic by calculating backward in time to determine when the item must be available to meet the promised date. This is accomplished by the following formulas:  

- Planned Delivery Date - Shipping Time = Planned Shipment Date  
- Planned Shipment Date - Outbound Warehouse Handling = Shipment Date  

The shipment date is used to make the availability check. If the item is available on this date, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] confirms that the requested/promised delivery can be met by setting the planned delivery date to equal the requested/promised delivery date. If the item is unavailable, it returns a blank date and the order processor can then use the CTP functionality.  

Based on new dates and times, all related dates are calculated according to the formulas listed earlier in this section. The CTP calculation takes longer but it gives an accurate date when the customer can expect to have the item delivered. The dates that are calculated from CTP are presented in the **Planned Delivery Date** and **Earliest Shipment Date** fields on the **Order Promising Lines** page.  

The order processor finishes the CTP process by accepting the dates. This means that a planning line and a reservation entry are created for the item before the calculated dates to ensure that the order is fulfilled.  

In addition to the external order promising that you can perform on the **Order Promising Lines** page, you can also promise internal or external delivery dates for bill-of-material items. For more information, see [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md).

## To set up order promising

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Order Promising Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Enter a number and time unit code in the **Offset(Time)** field. Select one of the following codes.  

    |Code|Description|  
    |----------|-----------------|  
    |**d**|Calendar day|  
    |**w**|Week|  
    |**m**|Month|  
    |**q**|Quarter|  
    |**y**|Year|  

    For example, "3w" indicates that the offset time is three weeks. To indicate the current period, prefix to any of these codes with the letter “c”. For example, if you want the offset time to be the current month, enter **cm**.  
3. Enter a number series in the **Order Promising Nos.** field by selecting a line from the list on the **No. Series** page.  
4. Enter an order promising template in the **Order Promising Template** field by selecting a line from the list on the **Req. Worksheet Template List** page.  
5. Enter a requisition worksheet in the **Order Promising Worksheet** field by selecting a line from the list on the **Req. Wksh. Names** page.

### Inbound and outbound warehouse handling times in order promising

If you want to include warehouse handling time in the order promising calculation on the purchase line, on the **Inventory Setup** page you can specify a default handling time to use on sales and purchase documents. You can also enter specific times for each of your locations on the **Location Card** page. 

#### To enter default inbound and outbound warehouse handling times for sales and purchase documents

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Inbound Whse. Handling Time** and **Outbound Whse. Handling Time** fields, enter the number of days that you want to include in the order promising calculations.  

#### To enter inbound and outbound warehouse handling times on locations

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Location**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the relevant location card.  
3.  On the **Warehouse** FastTab, in the **Inbound Whse. Handling Time** and **Outbound Whse. Handling Time** fields, enter the number of days that you want to be included in the order promising calculations.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  When you are creating a purchase order, if you choose **Location** in the **Ship-to** field on the **Shipping and Payment** FastTab, and then choose a location in the **Location Code** field, the **Outbound Whse. Handling Time** and **Inbound Whse. Handling Time** fields will use the handling time specified for the location. For sales orders, the same is true if you choose a location in the **Location Code** field. If no handling time is specified for the location, the **Outbound Whse. Handling Time** and **Inbound Whse. Handling Time** fields will be blank. If you leave the **Location Code** field blank on sales and purchase documents, the calculation uses the handling time specified on the **Inventory Setup**  page.

## To make an item critical

Before an item can be included in the order promising calculation, it must be marked as critical. This setup ensures that non-critical items don't cause irrelevant order promising calculations.   
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the relevant item card.  
3.  On the **Planning** FastTab, select the **Critical** field.  

## To calculate an order promising date

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the relevant sales order and select the sales order lines that you want application to calculate.  
3.  Choose the **Order Promising** action, and then choose the **Order Promising Lines** action.  
4.  Select a line, and then select one of the following options:  

    - Select **Available-to-Promise** if you want to calculate the earliest date that the item will be available with respect to inventory, scheduled receipts, and gross requirements.  
    - Select **Capable-to-Promise** if you know that the item is presently out of stock and you want to calculate the earliest date that the item can be available by issuing new replenishment requisitions.  
5.  Choose the **Accept** button to accept the earliest shipment date available.

# Understanding the Chart of Accounts

A chart of accounts (COA) serves as a comprehensive directory of financial accounts and their corresponding reference numbers. A COA typically has of two main categories of accounts:

* Balance sheet accounts: These accounts track your company’s assets, debts, and net worth.
* Income statement accounts: These accounts record income from various sources and also track expenses.

Balance sheet accounts are further categorized into three groups:

* Asset accounts: These accounts track all the valuable resources owned by your company.
* Liability accounts: They record your company’s debts.
* Equity accounts: Represent the residual value in the business after subtracting liabilities from assets.

Income accounts are divided into two groups:

* Revenue accounts: These accounts capture your company’s income from various sources.
* Expense accounts: These accounts capture all your company’s expenses.

Use the COA to record transactions in your organization’s general ledger. Each account typically has an identifier (account number) and a descriptive caption or header, and they're systematically coded based on their account type.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a standard chart of accounts that is ready to support your business.

The composition of your company’s chart of accounts is a strategic decision made by your management (or by country-specific regulation). It varies based on your company’s industry, business model, and financial structure. For instance, depending on your industry, you might have specific asset accounts tailored to your company's unique operations and needs:

* A retail business might emphasize inventory and accounts receivable.
* A technology company might focus on intangible assets like patents and software.
* A manufacturing plant would track fixed assets and supplies.

## The chart of accounts page

The chart of accounts shows all general ledger accounts. From the chart of accounts, you can do things like:  

* View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.  
* Close your income statement.  
* Open the General Ledger Account Card, where you can add or change settings.  
* See a list of posting groups for that account.
* View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

You can add, change, or delete general ledger accounts. However, to prevent discrepancies, you can't delete a general ledger account if its data is used in the chart of accounts. Also, you can block the accidental deletion of accounts in sensitive periods. To learn more about protecting accounts from deletion, go to [Deleting accounts](finance-setup-chart-accounts.md#delete-accounts).  

## The code hierarchy in G/L accounts

Businesses typically create a hierarchical structure in G/L account codes to reflect where they belong in the chart of accounts. For instance, in some implementations, G/L account codes that start with **1** denotes asset accounts, whereas G/L account codes that start with 3 denotes equity accounts. In some regions, there are local regulations for using a standard chart of accounts. To help users understand this hierarchy without the need to know the internal code structure, you can define headers and subtotals in your chart of accounts that encapsulate these internal structures.

## Designing your chart of accounts

Each line in the chart of accounts is a G/L account of one of the types:

* Posting (journals can post lines to these accounts)
* Heading (defines an overall heading in the chart of accounts)
* Total (defines a formula for a subtotal in the chart of accounts)
* Begin-Total (defines a beginning heading for a subtotal in the chart of accounts. All subsequent lines until an End-Total line are indented)
* End-Total (defines an ending heading for a subtotal and the formula for it in the chart of accounts. All subsequent lines after this End-Total line are outdented)

A minimalist chart of accounts can consist of only lines of posting accounts. You use the other four types to define how the chart of accounts also shows a financial statement with headers and subtotals. Totaling accounts are frequently used in financial reporting.

> [!TIP]
> If you use account types other than **Posting** in your chart of accounts, you can define different views to show the "raw" posting accounts without the reporting-type account types for totalling and headings. For example, Show only posting accounts and Hide blocked accounts.

## Use dimensions to simplify your chart of accounts

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from. So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department and project, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts.

To learn more about dimensions, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

## Organize general ledger (G/L) data using account categories

The **G/L Account Categories** page lets you create simple financial reports based on your chart of accounts.  

By providing categories, subcategories, and account mapping to your chart of accounts, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes basic financial reporting out of the box. If you're just getting started with financial reporting, the standard reports are excellent options until you become more experienced.

For more information, see [Organize general ledger (G/L) data using account categories](bi-account-categories.md).

## Get a quick overview of your finances

The **Chart of Accounts** page displays accounts in a hierarchical list that offers fast access to the key information for each account. However, the list is static, and if you have many accounts, you might have to scroll to view different accounts. If you just want a quick overview of the basics, such as net changes and balances, the **Chart of Accounts Overview** page is a useful alternative. The column layout on the page is the same as the **Chart of Accounts** page (though with fewer columns), so it's easy to understand. You can expand or collapse the hierarchical levels. To make it easy to switch between the pages, the **Chart of Accounts Overview** page is available from the **Chart of Accounts** page.

## Access to create and edit the chart of accounts

In a small organization, such as the CRONUS demonstration company, most users can edit the chart of accounts, except those users with a TEAM MEMBER license. However, larger organizations typically use roles and permissions to limit access to editing the chart of accounts. If you're an administrator, or have the Business Manager or Accountant role, you can control user permissions to give the right people access to the relevant tables. To learn more, go to [Get an overview of a user's permissions](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#get-an-overview-of-a-users-permissions).  

## Audit changes to G/L accounts setup

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your G/L accounts. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)] 

The following table lists the table for G/L accounts and its ID.

| Table | Table ID |
| ----- | -------- |
| G/L Account | 15 |

[!INCLUDE [include-audit-changes-to-setup-learn-more-link](includes/include-audit-changes-to-setup-learn-more-link.md)]



<!-- ## Standard chart of accounts in different regions
Uncomment when we have more examples added to our localization documentation

Some regions have defined standards for the chart of accounts structure you should use in your company. 

Here are some examples of such standards that have been implemented in localized versions of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

* [Standard chart of accounts in Denmark](localfunctionality/denmark/how-to-set-up-standard-coa.md)
-->

## Chart of accounts best practices

Here are some best practices that you might consider when you develop and maintaining your charts of accounts:

* Compose your company’s chart of accounts to support the financial reporting needs for your management to take strategic decisions.
* Consider starting simple with fewer G/L accounts. You can always add more detailed accounts if needed.
* Define headers and subtotals in your chart of accounts that summarize the internal structures in G/L accounts.
* Use dimensions to simplify your chart of accounts. Don't have specific G/L accounts for each product or department.
* Add new G/L accounts as they come in, but remove accounts from your chart of accounts only during period-end of your finance period.

# Changing your language and region settings

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available in many markets and languages, and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers features to help companies comply with local regulatory requirements. You can use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in different languages, and can change the language for display texts. If you change your language setting, sign out and sign in again to apply the change. The new setting applies only to you, and not to everyone else in your company.  

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

For example, you're using the Canadian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in English, German, French, or another language, but it's still the Canadian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. It isn't the same as [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Germany, where features are adapted for German requirements.  

To change the language of the user interface, go to the **My Settings** page. To learn more, go to [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md#language).

> [!NOTE]  
> The choice of languages resets to your setting on your Microsoft 365 profile if your administrator synchronizes users from Microsoft 365 to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can't change the texts that are stored as application data. Examples of such texts are the names of items in inventory, or the comments for a customer. In other words, these types of text aren't translated.  

> [!NOTE]  
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only supports a single character set for data. Some characters might not be supported in your environment. You might experience problems when you try to view data that was entered using a different character set. For instance, your environment might support only English and Russian characters. In this case, if you enter data in a different language, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might not store it correctly. Contact your system administrator to make sure you understand which languages are supported by your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Changing your region setting

Region is different from both language and legal requirements in local markets. Region determines how your data presents itself, such as the decimal separator, and how text aligns to the left or right. The region also determines some of the system elements in the browser, such as the action to create a new item in a list.  

You can change the region in the browser tab that you're using to work in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The change applies only to you and not to the other users in your company. The choice of region is reset to your setting on your Microsoft 365 profile if your administrator synchronizes users from Microsoft 365 into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you change the region, you'll see a long list of languages and regions. However, the language isn't influenced by the choice of region.  

To change the region, go to the **My Settings** page. To learn more, go to [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).  

## Changing the region setting for customers, contacts, and vendors

Some businesses use an external service that validates address information in their country or region. However, when you need to update address information, the structured approach that these services use might not always be what's right for some scenarios. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a more flexible means of entering address details.

On the **General Ledger Setup** page, if you turn on the **Require Country/Region Code in Address** toggle, changes to the **Country/Region Code** field on addresses for customers, contacts, or vendors resets the values in other address fields.

## Custom address formats for countries/regions

The countries and regions in which you do business might have different formats for addresses. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] lets you customize the format in which postal addresses show for each region. To define a custom format, on the **Countries/Regions** page, choose the **Custom Address Format** action. You can adjust the order of the address information by using the **Move Up** and **Move Down** actions. To change the field on a line, in the **Field ID** field, choose :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The assist edit icon.":::, and then choose the field.

In some cases, you might need to add multiple fields on a line. By default, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] lets you combine the city, postal code, and country. To add multiple fields on a line, enter **0** in the **Field ID** field, and then choose the value in the **Line Format** field to open the **Custom Address Format Lines** page. Add a new line for each piece of information.

## Application version

# Sign up for a free Dynamics 365 Business Central trial

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a free trial. There are two ways to access the trial version, depending on your location. If you are in a country where Microsoft offers official localization, you can follow one path. If you are in a country where localization is handled by partners, you'll need to follow a different path. Explore the different types of localization [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). After a quick sign-up, you'll have access to many of the app's key features. The trial allows you to test the app with sample data. If you want to try out things with your own data, you'll switch to a free 30-day trial. [Learn more about Business Central features](across-business-functionality.md).  

## Start the trial in Microsoft-based localizations 

You can find your free [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] trial on the **[Dynamics 365 Business Central product](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/products/business-central)** page. You just need to follow the steps and you'll get trial localized version tailored for your location. If you want eventually to try different localization, you can do it in the sandbox. 

<!--## To sign up for the trial-->

[!INCLUDE [trial-get](includes/trial-get.md)]

## Start with the trial in location with partner-based localizations  

In countries where Microsoft doesn't offer built-in localization, obtaining a localized version by default isn't possible due to localization being managed by partners. Consequently, Microsoft can only provide the standard base app, typically without localization or translation. To avoid confusion not offering all local requirements and the language, we have different path of getting trial version, so you can have full local experience.  

You can get your trial version following these steps:

1. You must run "Find your partner" on [Microsoft web site](https://partner.microsoft.com/partnership/find-a-partner) or ask local Microsoft office for advice. 
2. Microsoft can help you find a partner for you or you might have already found a partner based on your experience. 
3. You might offer your partner for the trial version and then partner goes to CSP.  
   1. Finds or adds customer tenant.   
   2. Assigns the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Trial SKU in CSP. 
   3. Assigns the localization and translation, and eventually assigns translated demo data to the created tenant. 
   4. Sends customer link to the environment.   
   5. The test trial environment will be accessible. 

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft doesn't oversee how partners set up the trial environment or what specific elements are included. While Microsoft offers recommendations, partners have the flexibility to implement them in their own way. Using a trial version from one partner doesn't obligate you to purchase a license from them, and you can always choose to switch partners at any time.  

## What to try

Your trial environment includes the same features as the paid version. The links below guide you through some of the key features.

- [Overview of business functionality](across-business-functionality.md)  
- [Get started](ui-get-ready-business.md#get-started)  
- [Get productive](ui-work-product.md)  
- [Quick starts](quick-start-business-central.md)  

## Get started with a subscription

Each time you sign in during the trial period, a notification in a blue bar at the top displays the time remaining. If you decide to subscribe, find a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner. For more information, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](/dynamics365/business-central/across-faq#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner). The reselling partner can help you set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to fit your business, including importing your data from your previous system. You can also customize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by adding apps from [the Microsoft commercial marketplace](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646).  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online uses Microsoft 365. If your company uses a different type of email setup, the reselling partner can help you decided how to migrate, or if you should use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.  

You can also contact the [[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Sales team](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=828707).

# Setting up service management
Before you can start using Service Management features in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], there are a few things to set up. For example, you can establish coding for standard services, symptoms, and fault codes, and the service items and service item types based on your company’s customer service requirements.  

When you set up Service Management, you must decide what services to offer customers and the schedule for those services. A service is a type of work performed by one or more resources and provided to a customer. For example, a service could be a type of computer repair. A service item is the equipment or item needing servicing, for example, the computer needing repair, installed at a specific customer. You can set up services as part of a group of related repair or maintenance items.  
  
When you define a service, you can associate it with the skills required to perform the service. To help your service representatives be efficient, you can also set up real time troubleshooting guidelines and assign typical startup costs, such as travel costs or other fees.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# The QuickBooks Payroll file import extension
Use the QuickBooks Payroll File Import extension to import payroll transactions from QuickBooks to general ledger accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this is useful when you're transitioning from QuickBooks to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or if you outsource your payroll but also want to keep track of it in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Steps to import payroll data
The first step is for you, or maybe your accountant, to use the export features in QuickBooks to export the payroll data to an .IIF file. The second step is to open the **General Journals** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and use the **Import Payroll Transactions** action to import the file. During the import process, you map the general ledger accounts from QuickBooks to corresponding accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The final step is to post the payroll transactions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] according to the account mapping. 

For more information, see [Import Payroll Transactions](finance-how-import-payroll-transactions.md).

# Design your own financial reports

You can use financial reporting to create custom reports. For example, if you want more complex reports.

To create a new financial report, choose the **New** action. You can then give the report a name and add a description. Afterward, you can specify default settings for the report, such as:

* **Row Definition**
* **Column Definition**
* **Analysis Views**

## Copy an existing report

To copy an existing report, use the **Copy Financial Report** action. When you choose this option, you can rename the copied report. You can also copy and rename individual row definitions and column definitions.  

## Create your own row definition

To create your own row definition, choose **Edit Row Definition**. To explore existing row definitions, choose the **Name** field. Choose **New**, and give the row definition a name and description.

You now have a blank row definition that you can use to build your new report.  

> [!TIP]
> Take a moment to personalize your screen to show only the **Row No.**, **Description**, **Totaling Type**, **Totaling**, **Row Type**, and **Bold** columns. These columns are recommended as the minimum columns needed for a basic row definition. There are many columns available, which can be used as you become familiar with creating more advanced financial reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

When getting started with financial reporting, there are a few choices we recommended in fields. The following table describes the recommended choices.

|Field  |Option  |
|---------|---------|
|Row No.     |Alpha, numeric, or alphanumeric codes are used here to identify rows in formulas.         |
|Description  |Specifies the words to label each row of the report.         |
|Totaling Type    |The **Posting Accounts** and **Formulas** options are often used.         |
|Totaling     | Together with the **Totaling Type** of **Posting Accounts**, maps general ledger accounts to the report, either individually or in ranges.<br><br> Together with **Totaling Type** of the **Formula**, uses row references to the **Row No.** field to do basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.          |
|Row Type     |**Net Change** is used for income statement reports.<br><br>**Balance at Date** is used for balance sheet reports.<br><br>**Beginning Balance** is used for cash flow statements.          |
|Bold     |  Simple formatting to apply to headers, subtotals, and other elements of the report that you want to emphasize.       |

## When to show the opposite sign in rows and columns

Use the **Show Opposite Sign** option to show the opposite sign in a credit balance account, such as revenue, for reports you present to people who aren't accountants.

> [!TIP]
> It's important to remember that you should use the **Show Opposite Sign** option on the posting account line for the account where the sign needs to be flipped. If you use the option on a formula such as gross margin, where both revenue and cost of goods sold are represented, the calculation will be incorrect. Pay extra attention when you use the setting in formulas.

## Create your own column definition

To create your own column definition, choose **Edit Column Definition**. To explore existing definitions, choose the **Name** field. Choose **New**, and give the new column definition a name and a description.

You now have a blank column definition that you can use to build your new report.  

> [!TIP]
> Take a moment to personalize your screen to show only the **Column No.**, **Column Header**, **Column Type**, **Ledger Entry Type**, **Budget Name**, **Formula**, and **Comparison Period Formula** columns. These columns are recommended as the minimum needed for a basic column definition. There are many columns available, which you can use as you become more familiar with creating advanced financial reports.

When getting started with financial reporting, there are a few field choices we recommended. The following table describes the recommendations.

|Field  |Option  |
|---------|---------|
|Column No.     |Alpha, numeric, or alphanumeric codes are used here to identify columns in formulas.         |
|Column Header     |Used to hold the words used to label each column of the report.         |
|Column Type     |The often used options are **Net Change**, **Balance at Date**, and **Formula**.<br><br>**Net Change** is used for income statement reports.<br><br>**Balance at Date** is used for balance sheet reports.<br><br>**Formula** uses row references to Column No. to do basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.          |
|Ledger Entry Type     |Entries are used for general ledger entries.<br><br>**Budget Entries** are used for budget entry comparisons.         |
|Budget Name     |When using budget entries, select the budget to use.         |
|Formula     | Formula uses row references to Column No. to do basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.        |
|Comparison Period Formula     | Holds various period-related formulas that determine the period for the report combined with the date filter.        |

## When to use a comparison period formula and comparison date formula in a column definition

There are two options for column definition comparisons for accounting periods:

* Comparison period formula
* Comparison date formula

Comparison period formula is often used for reports that show monthly, quarterly, or annual accounting periods. In most cases, financial reports use these increments of time.  

Comparison date formula is typically used for reports that show weekly or daily accounting periods. These increments of time are appropriate for operational reporting, such as daily sales or weekly invoicing.

### Column definitions that include budgets

Budgets can be included on any report when included on the column definition. By selecting a ledger entry type of **Budget Entries**, and entering the **Budget Name** for the selected budget, you can easily show comparisons of actual to budget in reports.

# The Ceridian Payroll Extension

To account for salary payments and related transactions, you must import and post financial transactions made by your payroll provider to the general ledger.

To do this, you first import a file that you receive from the payroll provider into the **General Journal** page. Then you map the external accounts in the payroll file to the relevant G/L accounts. Lastly, you post the payroll transactions according to the account mapping. For more information, see [Import Payroll Transactions](finance-how-import-payroll-transactions.md).

The Ceridian Payroll extension allows you to import payroll transactions from the Ceridian HR/Payroll (US) and Ceridian PowerPay (Canada) services.

# Moving Items

You can move items in your warehouse in different ways, depending on how you've configured your warehouse. The complexity can vary:

* Small warehouses might use basic warehouse configurations to handle orders individually, in a single or multiple steps.
* Large warehouses might use advanced configurations where all warehouse activities are coordinated by a directed workflow. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

Items may need to be moved between bins, for example, due to internal operations:

* A production order needs components delivered, or its finished items put away.
* A warehouse manager wants to optimize space.
* Unplanned movements to and from operations.
* Replenish picking bins or shop floor bins.
* Update bin contents.

Counting, adjusting, and reclassifying items can involve warehouse tasks that must be performed on warehouse entries before they can be synchronized with item ledger entries. Learn more at [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md).  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Design Details: Item Tracking Availability
The **Item Tracking Lines** and **Item Tracking Summary** pages provide dynamic availability information for serial or lot numbers. The purpose of this is to increase transparency for users on outbound documents, such as sales orders, by showing them which serial numbers or how many units of a lot number are currently assigned on other open documents. This reduces uncertainty that is caused by double allocation and instills confidence in order processors that the item tracking numbers and dates that they are promising on unposted sales orders can be fulfilled. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Tracking Lines Page](design-details-item-tracking-lines-window.md).  

 When you open the **Item Tracking Lines** page, availability data is retrieved from the **Item Ledger Entry** table and the **Reservation Entry** table, with no date filter. When you choose the **Serial No.** field or the **Lot No.** field, the **Item Tracking Summary** page opens and shows a summary of the item tracking information in the **Reservation Entry** table. The summary contains the following information about each serial or lot number on the item tracking line:  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Total Quantity**|The total quantity of the serial or lot number that is currently in inventory.|  
|**Total Requested Quantity**|The total quantity of the serial or lot number that is currently requested in all documents.|  
|**Current Pending Quantity**|The quantity that is entered in the current instance of the **Item Tracking Lines** page but is not yet committed to the database.|  
|**Total Available Quantity**|The quantity of the serial or lot number that is available for the user to request.<br /><br /> This quantity is calculated from other fields on the page as follows:<br /><br /> total quantity – (total requested quantity + current pending quantity).|  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You can also see the information in the preceding table by using the **Select Entries** function on the **Item Tracking Lines** page.  

 To preserve database performance, availability data is only retrieved once from the database when you open the **Item Tracking Lines** page and when you use the **Refresh Availability** function on the page.  

## Calculation Formula  
 As described in the preceding table, the availability of a given serial or lot number is calculated as follows.  

 total available quantity = quantity in inventory – (all demands + quantity not yet committed to the database)  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  This formula implies that the serial or lot number availability calculation considers only inventory and ignores projected receipts. Accordingly, supply that is not yet posted to inventory does not affect item tracking availability, as opposed to regular item availability where projected receipts are included.

# Why a Page is Locked from Personalization

There are two conditions that prevent you from personalizing a page. Either the page is locked (as indicated by the ![Personalize Lock.](media/personalization-lock-icon.png "Personalize lock")) icon or it's blocked (as indicated by the ![Personalization blocked.](media/personalization-blocked-icon.png "Personalization blocked") icon).

## Locked from Personalizing

If there's a ![Personalize Lock.](media/personalization-lock-icon.png "Personalize lock") icon in the **Personalizing** banner when you open a page, you're currently prevented from making any more personalization changes to the page.

<!-- This is because we changed the way personalization works behind the scenes since the last time that you personalized the page. Unfortunately, the old way and new of doing things do not work together.

The page currently includes the last personalization changes that you made. If you want to continue personalizing the page, then you can choose the lock icon and then **Unlock**. Just be aware that if you choose to unlock the page, the current personalization of the page will be cleared, and you will have to start from scratch.
-->

There can be two reasons:

1. You've personalized the page before, but it was done using an earlier version of the product. We changed the way personalization works behind the scenes since the last time that you personalized the page. Unfortunately, the old way and new way of doing things don't work together.

2. Until now, you've only used the bow deprecated [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] to personalize the page.

### Unlocking the Page

If you want to unlock a page and continue personalizing it, choose the ![Personalize Lock](media/personalization-lock-icon.png "Personalize lock") icon, and then choose the **Unlock** action.  

> [!CAUTION]
> The current personalization of the page will be cleared. The page will go back to its original layout, and you'll have to start from scratch.  

## Blocked from Personalizing

If there's a ![Personalization blocked](media/personalization-blocked-icon.png "Personalization blocked") icon in the **Personalizing** banner, you're blocked from doing any personalization to the page.

<!-- Only text is translated, so removing this image for non-English UX reasons.  ![Personalize blocked.](media/personalization-blocked.png "Personalize lock") -->

The reason is that the Role Center or role that is currently associated with your user account modifies this page specifically for your role. Contact your administrator for assistance. Alternatively, try switching to a Role Center that does include role-tailoring for this page. For more information, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).

# Set Up Finance Charge Terms

When a customer does not pay by the due date, you can have finance charges calculated automatically and add them to the overdue amounts on the customer's account. You can inform customers of the added charges by sending finance charge memos. But first, you must set up a code that represents each finance charge calculation. Then you can enter this code in the Fin. Charge Terms Code field on customer cards.  

## Finance charge terms

You must set up finance charge terms for each finance charge calculation, and then assign the terms to the customer in the **Fin. Charge Terms Code** field on the **Customer** page.

Finance charges can be calculated using either the average daily balance or the balance due methods.

* Average daily balance  
  
  The number of days the payment is overdue is taken into account:  
  *Average Daily Balance method* - *Finance Charge* = *Overdue Amount* x *(Days Overdue / Interest Period)* x *(Interest Rate/100)*

* Balance due  
  
  The finance charge is a percentage of the overdue amount:  
  *Balance Due method* - *Finance Charge* = *Overdue Amount* x *(Interest Rate / 100)*

Additionally, each term in the Finance Charge Terms table is linked to a subtable, the Finance Charge Text table. For each set of finance charge terms, you can define a beginning and/or an ending text to include on the finance charge memo.

### To set up finance charge terms

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Finance Charge Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.
3. To use more than one combination of finance charge terms, set up a code for each one.

    For each finance charge term, you can specify individual conditions that can include additional fees in both LCY and in foreign currency. You can define additional fees in foreign currencies for each term on the **Finance Charge Terms** page.
4. Choose the **Currencies** action.
5. On the **Currencies for Fin. Chrg. Terms** page, define for each term a currency code and an additional fee.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you create finance charges in a foreign currency, the foreign currency conditions that you set up here will be used to create finance charge memos. If there are no foreign currency finance charge conditions set up, the LCY finance charge conditions specified on the **Finance Charge Terms** page will be used and then converted to the relevant currency.

    For each finance charge term, you can specify text that will be printed before (**Beginning Text**) or after (**Ending Text**) on the entries on the finance charge memo.  
6. Choose the **Beginning Text** or **Ending Text** actions respectively, and fill on the **Finance Charge Text** page.
7. To automatically insert related values in the resulting finance charge text, enter the following placeholders in the **Text** field.

|Placeholder|Value|  
|-----------------|-----------|  
|%1|Content of the **Document Date** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%2|Content of the **Due Date** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%3|Content of the **Interest Rate** field on the related finance charge terms|  
|%4|Content of the **Remaining Amount** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%5|Content of the **Interest Amount** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%6|Content of the **Additional Fee** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%7|The total amount of the reminder|  
|%8|Content of the **Currency Code** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%9|Content of the **Posting Date** field on the finance charge memo header|

# Allocate Costs to Intercompany Partners
When you use intercompany postings to transfer documents between partner companies, the VAT-related settings (primarily the VAT business posting group) assigned to the customer or vendor accounts (associated with the intercompany Partner) control whether, and how, VAT is calculated and registered. 
You can also do cost distributions directly from a purchase order to partner companies. For example, if you register a purchase invoice from an external vendor and you want to distribute some or all of the costs to one or more intercompany partners.

You can allocate costs can be to one or more intercompany partners using the following:

* **Intercompany General Journals** - These journals are useful when a service is purchased. For example, when a parent company hires a service to set up computer systems in two subsidiaries. The invoice is sent to the parent company, but the costs are allocate to the intercompany partners. For more information, see [Work with Intercompany Documents and Journals](intercompany-how-work-documents-journals.md).
* Purchase orders and invoices - Using purchase documents is useful when the purchasing functions of, for example, operating expenses, are centralized in one company and then allocated to the intercompany partners.

## To allocate costs using an intercompany general journal
To enter a  line in an intercompany general journal, follow these steps. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany General Journal** , and then choose the related link.
2. If required, in the **External Document No.** field, enter the document number on the invoice from the vendor.
3. In the **Document Type** field, choose **Invoice**.
4. In the **Account Type** field, choose **Vendor**.
5. In the **Account No.** field, choose the vendor.
6. In the **Amount** field, enter a negative amount equal to the amount on the invoice.
7. In the **Bal. Account Type** field, choose **G/L Account**.
8. In the **Bal. Account No.** field, choose the balancing account to use.
9. To allocate costs to intercompany partners, follow these steps:
   1. Create a new line.
   2. Leave the **Document Type** field, choose the option that leaves the field blank.
   3. In the **Document No.** field, enter a number that is different than the number in the **External Document No.** field. The cost allocation is considered a different transaction.
   4. In the **Account Type** field, choose **IC Partner**.
   5. In the **Account No.** field, choose the intercompany partner to allocate the cost to.
   6. In the **Balance Account Type** field, choose **G/L Account**.
   7. In the **Balance Account No.** field, choose the G/L account to which to post the amount you receive from the intercompany partner.
   1. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount of the invoice to allocate to the intercompany partner.
   1. In the **IC Partner G/L Acc. No.** field, choose the G/L account that you want to post the amount to for the intercompany partner. 
   1. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Repeat these steps for each intercompany partner who should share in the cost.
1. To post the document and allocate the costs, choose **Post**.  

## To allocate costs using a purchase document
The following procedure describes how to allocate costs using a purchase invoice. The steps are the same for purchase orders.

> [!NOTE]
> To complete these steps you must personalize the **Purchase Invoice** page by adding the **IC Partner Code**, **IC Partner Ref. Type**, and **IC Partner** fields. For more information, see [To start personalizing a page through the Personalizing banner](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoice** , and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Type** field, choose **G/L Account**.
   
   G/L Account is the only option you can use to allocate costs.  
1. In the **No.** field, choose the G/L account to post to.
1. In the **IC Partner Code** field, choose the intercompany partner to allocate the cost to.
1. In the **IC Partner Ref. Type** choose the G/L account to use for the allocation. This account will map the expense to an account in the intercomany partner's chart of accounts.
1. In the **Quantity** field, specify the number of units to charge to the intercompany partner.
1. In the **Direct Unit Cost Excl. VAT (or Incl. VAT)** field, enter the cost per item to charge to the intercompany partner.
1. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] 
1. To post the purchase order, choose **Post**.

## To send the allocated costs to intercompany partners
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **IC Outbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose lines to send, and then choose the **Send to IC Partner** action. 
3. To allocate the costs, choose the **Complete Line Actions** action.

## Calculating VAT for Cost Distributions
When you use a document to distribute costs to intercompany partners, there are two VAT settings to be aware of: 
* The settings on the G/L account for expenses:
   * If the general business or VAT business posting groups are set up on the G/L account, then the calculation depends on the groups and the product groups from the document line.
   * If the general business or VAT business posting groups are not specified on the G/L account, the calculation depends on the following:
* The posting group settings on the intercompany partner
   * Whether the intercompany partner is assigned to a customer number that does not have a general business or VAT business posting groups specified.
   * There is no customer number associated with the intercompany partner. Then the general business or VAT business posting groups are blank, and the line in the VAT posting setup is used, which is usually a group where 0% VAT is specified.

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to validate both the intercompany partner setup and the G/L account setup (for the expense account used for the cost distribution) before you allocate costs to intercompany partners.

# Sustainability value chain in transfers

To use the sustainability value chain with transfer orders, you must enable the **Enable Value Chain Tracking** field on the **Sustainability Setup** page.  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Check whether the basic setup already exists. If it doesn't, follow [these instructions](finance-sustainability-setup.md) to set it up.  
3. On the **Procurement** FastTab, select the **Enable Value Chain tracking** field.
4. Close the page.

## Work with transfer orders  

To learn how to work with transfer orders, go to [To transfer items with a transfer order](inventory-how-transfer-between-locations.md#to-transfer-items-with-a-transfer-order).  

To use transfer orders in the sustainability value chain process, you must add the carbon equivalent (CO2e) emission that you produce in the transfer process. For example, if you transfer goods by truck. You can add it in the **Total CO2e** field for each line on a transfer order. The value is the total emissions for the item quantities on the lines.

After you post a transfer order, you can find entries related to the transfer on the **Posted Transfer Shipment** page. To find the entries, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted transfer shipments**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the **Posted Transfer Shipment** you want to check, and then choose the **Find entries** action.
3. On the **Find entries** page, choose **Sustainability Value Entry** to review the transactions related to this document.
4. Close the page.

> [!NOTE]
> Regardless of whether you select the **Direct Transfer** field on the **Transfer Order** page, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates sustainability value entries only for transactions related to the posted transfer shipment. The transactions increase the **CO2e per Unit** value for transferred items using the average method.

# Project analytics

Businesses capture lots of data during daily activities that supports business intelligence (BI) for project managers, such as:

- Cost performance for projects
- Completion rates for projects
- Financial data for projects

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's project data:

- Power BI reports for projects
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using Open in Excel)
- Built-in project analytics tools
- Built-in project reports

Each of these features has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data analysis and the role of the user. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to gain insights into your projects.

## Analytics needs in projects

When you think about the analytics needs in projects management, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes different analytics needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use the data in different ways. For example, people in project management interact with data differently than people in finance.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role  | Data aggregation | Typical ways to consume data          | 
|------------------- |-------------------| ---------------------- |
|COO / CFO / CEO | Performance data  | KPIs, dashboards, financial reports               |
|Project Manager     | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports, ad-hoc analysis      |
|Project participant | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports, on-screen task data |

## Using Power BI to monitor project KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In project management, people often use the following KPIs to monitor project performance:

- % Complete
- % Invoiced
- Realization %
- Actual Profit
- Actual Profit Margin %
- Actual (Total Cost)
- Budget (Total Cost)

:::image type="content" source="media/projects/project-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Projects Overview Power BI Report" lightbox="media/projects/project-overview.png":::

These KPIs (and more) are available for projects in the Project Power BI app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

To learn more, go to [Power BI Projects app](projects-powerbi-app.md).

### Reports in the Power BI Projects app

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-projects-app](includes/power-bi-projects-app.md)]

To learn more, go to [Power BI Projects app](projects-powerbi-app.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of project data

Sometimes, you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data Analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **Project Ledger Entries**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

> [!TIP]
> If you configure OneDrive for system features, the Excel workbook opens in your browser.

## Built-in reports for projects

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports to help project organizations report on their data.

[!INCLUDE [report-explorer-projects](includes/report-explorer-projects.md)]

To learn more about reports that are relevant for project management, go to [Built-in project reports](project-reports.md).

## On-screen project analytics

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you project overviews and tasks to do, such as:

- [Monitor project progress and performance](projects-how-monitor-progress-performance.md)

# Application Compliance

This article provides information about how [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] empowers companies to streamline business processes while consistently and cost-effectively complying with increasing regulation and reporting requirements.

## Data privacy

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] supports data privacy laws and regulations. [Learn how to respond to data subject requests in Business Central](../admin-responding-to-requests-about-personal-data.md).

If you develop [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] extensions, you need to know [how data is classified in Dynamics 365](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-classifying-data).

[Learn more about data privacy in Dynamics 365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839)<!--(https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement)-->.

## Accounting processes and controls to aid compliance

Companies face increasing financial accounting challenges each year. Depending on industry, markets, geographic location, and finance needs, an organization might be subject to local generally accepted accounting principles<!--note from editor: I assume that "local" means that you're not talking about the standard adopted by the SEC in the US. If this is true, you don't want to use the abbreviation because GAAP is an actual standard, which will need to be spelled out with title caps at first mention.--> and one or more of the following:

- The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), a US law passed in 2002 to help protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures.
- The International Financial Reporting Standards section of the European Union's International Accounting Standards (IAS/IFRS), which went into effect in 2005 and sets forth international accounting standards for recognition, measurement, consolidation, and reporting.
- Basel II: The New Basel Capital Accord, enacted in 2004 to address issues of financial institution risk and to promote greater stability in the overall financial system.

## Enhance people practices with technology

Compliance depends not only on accurate information and appropriate accounting processes, but also on the people who set up and administer those processes. An effective business management solution can facilitate compliance by helping manage valid and accessible information through transparent processes set up in compliance with industry and regulatory standards.

## Realize the benefits of an integrated business management solution

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] delivers real-time, integrated operational and financial information from across your organization, so you can:

- Track financial data by using custom financial reports for cash flow, revenue, balance sheets, fixed assets, capital structure, key performance indicators, and more.
- Help safeguard accuracy with role-based security and configurable application controls that prevent invalid or duplicate data entry.
- Quickly and easily generate financial reports in accordance with applicable regulatory standards.
- Maintain comprehensive audit trails with drill-down and drill-through functionality and change logs.

## Gain control of critical information, processes, and reports

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] improves control of key functions and information critical to the successful financial operation of your business.

### Manage compliance to the standards that matter

Integrated information, aligned processes, and easy-to-use tools help your people meet financial management expectations and standards that matter to your specific business.

### Tailor financial reports to your needs

- Define the structure of your company's chart of accounts based on business requirements and applicable regulatory standards.
- Create accounts and handle complex processes related to a range of business activities, including inventory valuation, foreign currencies, segment reporting, and departures from local GAAPs (generally accepted accounting principles).
- Control the level of detail for each recorded transaction and select detailed registration for specific types of transactions, such as fixed assets and accounts payable.
- Tailor scheduled calculations and displays for financial reporting, or export the information to Microsoft Excel for further analysis.

### Improve information validity

- Configure data fields to only accept information in the correct format, such as the correct number of decimal places or alphanumeric patterns.
- Help ensure information is complete with application controls, such as requiring a vendor invoice number to be entered before a purchase order can be posted.
- Reduce the risk of inaccurate information or tampering, and help protect sensitive information by restricting access to information based on job role.
- Prohibit access, provide read-only access, or enable full access for users to add, edit, or delete information.
- Easily identify and resolve discrepancies by using a reconciliation feature that retrieves current bank account and transaction information and compares it to general ledger posts.
- Schedule manual or automatic backups to help protect information from electronic failures.

### Comply quickly with discovery requests and reporting demands

- Save time when creating standard reports that use common business parameters and criteria to satisfy typical reporting needs, ranging from order summaries to aging accounts receivable.
- Perform complex reviews by using basic or advanced business analytics functionality.
- Create custom reports by using both built-in tools and integration with Microsoft Power BI.

### Help ensure clear audit trails

- Trace documents and information both forward and backward through the system, from the original source to final financial statements and back.
- Identify how, when, and by whom information was entered or edited, and to which account financial entries have been posted.
- Look up database changes, including previous and revised data, in the solution's [change log](../across-log-changes.md).
- Increase audit trail transparency and usability, and speed information access for third-party auditors with drill-down, look-up, filtering, register, and navigation features.

## Compliance and local functionality

Microsoft builds localized versions of Business Central for a limited number of markets. These localizations primarily focus on regulatory features in the tax and financial areas but can sometimes involve other parts of the solution. If you want to see what is built in Microsoft's localized versions of Business Central, see **Local Functionality** in the menu on this website and choose a country/region. Learn more at [Local Functionality](../about-localization.md). 

#### Sarbanes-Oxley: Validating Data and Processes
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act establishes standards for all U.S. public company boards, management, and public accounting firms, including evaluation and disclosure of the adequacy of the company's internal financial reporting controls. Documenting and testing critical manual and automated controls represents a huge commitment of time and resources for companies. Business Central is especially suited for subsidiaries of larger organizations, and can help support small to mid-sized businesses in complying with Sarbanes-Oxley.

#### IAS/IFRS: Recognition and Measurement Standards
  
Depending on the current local GAAPs, one of the major recognition and measurement changes for IAS/IFRS is the extended use of fair-value principles instead of historical cost. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] can help companies calculate fair value and net present value (NPV) concepts, which are focused on current and expected cash flow streams rather than historical purchase price. On the reporting side, it can provide segment reporting by business unit and geographical location.

#### Basel II: Implications for reporting and analysis

Basel II, developed by the Bank for International Settlements, helps ensure safety and security in the financial system in three key areas: minimum capital requirements, supervisory review process, and market discipline. Although the accord applies to financial institutions and doesn't target small and medium-sized businesses, Basel II might have some implications for these organizations in reporting and analysis.

# Set up and report Intrastat

All companies in the European Union must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. You must report the movement of goods to the statistics authorities in your country/region every month, and the report must be delivered to the tax authorities. This is referred to as Intrastat Reporting. You use the **Intrastat Journal** page to complete periodic Intrastat reports.

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

## Required and optional Setups

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customer cards and Vendor cards include a field, **Intrastat Partner Type**, that has the same option values as the **Partner Type** field: *"" (blank)*, *Company*, and *Person*. The **Intrastat Partner Type** field has replaced the **Partner Type** field in Intrastat reporting. **Partner Type** is used in SEPA to define the SEPA Direct Debit Scheme (Core or B2B). **Intrastat Partner Type** is used for Intrastat reporting only. This way, you can specify different values for the two fields, if you need to.
>
> However, note that if the **Intrastat Partner Type** field is left blank, the value from the **Partner Type** field is used for Intrastat reporting.

Before you can use the Intrastat journal to report Intrastat information, there are several things you must set up:  

* **Intrastat Setup**: Intrastat Setup page is used to enable intrastat reporting and set defaults for it. You can specify whether you need to report Intrastat from shipments (dispatches), receipts (arrivals) or both depending on thresholds set by your local regulations. You can also set default transaction types for regular and return documents, used for nature of transaction reporting.
* **Intrastat journal templates**: You must set up the Intrastat journal templates and batches you will use. Because Intrastat is reported monthly, you must create 12 Intrastat journal batches based on the same template.  
* **Commodity codes**: Customs and tax authorities have established numerical codes that classify items and services. You specify these codes on items.
* **Transaction nature codes**: Countries and regions have different codes for types of Intrastat transactions, such as ordinary purchase and sale, exchange of returned goods, and exchange of non-returned goods. Set up all of the codes that apply to your country/region. You use these codes on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab on sales and purchase documents, and when you process returns.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Starting in January 2022, Intrastat requires different transaction nature code for dispatches to private individuals or non-VAT registered businesses and VAT registered businesses. To comply with this requirement, we recommend that you review and/or add new transaction nature codes in the **Transaction Types** page according to the requirements in your country. You should also review and update the **Intrastat Partner Type** field to *Person* for private individual or non-VAT registered businesses customers in the relevant **Customer** page. If you are unsure about the correct intrastat partner type or transaction type to use, we recommend that you ask an expert in your country or region.

* **Transport methods**: There are seven, one-digit codes for Intrastat transport methods. **1** for sea, **2** for rail, **3** for road, **4** for air, **5** for post, **7** for fixed installations, and **9** for own propulsion (for example, transporting a car by driving it). [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does not require these codes, however, we recommend that the descriptions provide a similar meaning.  
* **Transaction specifications**: Use these to supplement the descriptions from the transaction types.  
* **Country of origin**: Use the two-letter ISO Alpha Codes for the country/region where the good was obtained or produced. If the good was produced in more than one country/region, the country/region of origin is the last country where it was significantly processed.
* **VAT identification number of the partner operator in the Member State of import**: This is the VAT-ID number of the partner operator in the Member State of import. The VAT-ID is also used in the exchange of intra-EU-export data among Member States, and allows Member States to allocate the received data to the importing company in their own country/region. Reporting units must report the VAT-ID of the company that declared the intra-Union acquisition of goods in the Member State of import.

> [!NOTE]
> The business partner VAT-ID to use can differ, depending on the business circumstance. For example, the ID to use differs for scenarios such as chain sales, where a supplier sells a product to another country, and then that company resells the item to another business in the same country, triangular trade, and so on. If you are unsure about the correct VAT-ID to use, we recommend that you ask an expert in your country or region.

Optionally, you can also set up:

* **Areas**: Use these to supplement information about countries and regions.  
* **Entry/exit points**: Use these to specify the locations where you ship or receive items to or from other countries/regions. Heathrow Airport is an example of an entry or exit point. You enter entry or exit points on sales and purchase documents on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab. This information will also be copied from the item entries when you create the Intrastat journal.  

### To set up Intrastat templates and batches

The Intrastat batch jobs include only item entries, and not general ledger entries. If you have general ledger entries that qualify for Intrastat reporting, you must enter them manually. For example, if you purchase a computer from another EU country or region, the computer is not placed in inventory, but is posted to a general ledger account. You must manually enter this type of entry in the Intrastat journal.  

You can export the entries to a file that you can send to your Intrastat authorities. You can also print a report, manually enter the information on the forms from your authorities, and then submit the information.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommended that you set up an Intrastat journal batch for each month.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Create a template for each Intrastat form you use.  
3. To create batches, choose the **Batches** action.  
4. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]. Create a template for each Intrastat form you use.

> [!NOTE]
> In the **Statistics Period** field, enter the statistics period as a four-digit number, where the first two digits represent the year and the next two digits represent the month. For example, enter 1706 for June, 2017.

### To set up transport methods

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transport Methods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### To set up which Intrastat report fields are mandatory

In some countries/regions, such as Spain and UK, the authorities require that Intrastat reports include, for example, the shipment method for purchases or some other values when sales are over a certain threshold. On the **Intrastat Setup** page, you can select to make **Intrastat Checklist Setup** to set mandatory fields on the **Intrastat Journal** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Intrastat Checklist Setup** action.
3. On the **Intrastat Checklist Setup** page, select in the **Field Name** to pick Intrastat report field you want to make mandatory.

### Czechia

Specifically for Czech businesses, you must also set up commodity codes and transaction nature codes.  

#### To set up commodity codes

All items that you buy or sell must have a commodity code.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Commodity Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. To assign a commodity code to an item, go to the **Item Card** page, expand the **Costs & Posting** FastTab, and then enter the code in the **Commodity Code** field.

### Italy

Specifically for Italian businesses, you must also set up commodity codes and transaction nature codes.  

#### To set up transaction nature codes

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transaction Nature Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

> [!TIP]
> If you frequently use a particular transaction nature code, you can make it the default. To do this, go to the **Intrastat Setup** page, and choose the code.

## To report Intrastat

After you fill in the Intrastat journal, you can run the **Checklist report** action to make sure that all information in the journal is correct. Mandatory fields you have set in **Intrastat Checklist Setup** page that are missing values will be shown in Errors and warning fact box on the **Intrastat Journal** page. Afterward, you can print an Intrastat report as a form, or create a file to submit to the tax authority in your country/region.  

### To fill in Intrastat journals

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journal** and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intrastat Journal** page, in the **Batch Name** field, choose the relevant journal batch, and then choose **OK**.  
3. Choose the **Suggest Lines** action. The **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields will already contain the dates specified for the statistics period on the journal batch.  
4. In the **Cost Regulation %** field, you can enter a percentage to cover transport and insurance. If you enter a percentage, the content of the **Statistical Value** field in the journal is proportionally higher.  
5. Choose **OK** to start the batch job.  

The batch job retrieves all the item entries in the statistics period and inserts them as lines in the Intrastat journal. You can edit the lines if needed.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The batch job retrieves only the entries that contain a country/region code for which an Intrastat code has been entered on the **Countries/Regions** page. Therefore, you must enter Intrastat codes for the country/region codes for which you will run the batch job. The batch job sets the **Partner VAT ID** field to *QV999999999999* for private individuals or non-VAT registered businesses (customers with the **Intrastat Partner Type** field set to *Person*), and it uses the value of the **Transaction Type** field on the posted item ledger entry or job ledger entry.

### To modify Intrastat journals lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intrastat Journal** page, in the **Batch Name** field, choose the relevant journal batch, and then choose **OK**.  
3. User filter pane to filter Intrastat Journal lines based on some criteria. For example, filter on **Partner VAT ID** fields with the value *QV999999999999*.
4. Choose **Share** icon ![Share a page in another app.](media/share-icon.png) and select **Edit in Excel**
5. In Excel, modify the Intrastat journal lines that you filtered out. For example, modify **Transaction Type** field values.  
6. Publish the changes that you have made in Excel back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] versions that do not support [**Edit in Excel**](across-work-with-excel.md#edit-in-excel) for journals, you can create configuration packages to export and import Intrastat journal lines to Excel. For more information, see [Migrate On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data) in the administration content.

### Report Intrastat on a form or a file

To get the information that is required on the Intrastat form from the statistical authorities, you must print the **Intrastat – Form** report. Before you can do this, you must prepare the Intrastat journal and fill it in. If you have both sales and purchase transactions, you must complete a separate form for each type, so that you must print the report two times.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intrastat Journal** page, choose the relevant journal batch in the **Batch Name** field.  
3. If you have not already done this, fill in the journal manually or choose **Suggest Lines** action.  
4. Choose the **Prints Intrastat Journal** action.  
5. On the **Intrastat Jnl. Line** FastTab, add a **Type** filter and then specify whether this is a **Receipt** or a **Shipment**.  
6. Choose **Send to** to print the report.  

### Report Intrastat in a file

You can submit the Intrastat report as a file. Before creating the file, you can print a checklist that contains the same information that will be in the file.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intrastat Journal** page, select the relevant journal batch in the **Batch Name** field.  
3. If you have not already done this, fill in the journal manually or by choosing the **Suggest Lines** action.  
4. Choose the **Create File** action.  
5. On the batch job page, choose the **OK** button.  
6. Choose **Save**.  
7. Browse to the location where you want to save the file, enter the file name, and then choose **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> When a line in the Intrastat report has a supplementary unit of measure, the weight of the item will not be shown, since this value is not required.

## Reorganize Intrastat journals

Because you must submit an Intrastat report every month, and you create a new journal batch for each report, you will eventually have many journal batches. The journal lines are not deleted automatically. You may want to reorganize the journal batch names periodically. You do this by deleting the journal batches that you no longer need. The journal lines in these batches are also deleted.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. To view the options, choose the **Batch Name** field.  
3. Choose the journal batches to be deleted, and then choose the **Delete** button.  

## Tariff numbers

In many countries/regions, the customs and tax authorities establish 8-digit item codes for various items. In order for item entries to contain the necessary information when the program imports them to the Intrastat journal line, you must have entered the information about the tariff number in the **Tariff Numbers** page. Find the codes for the items that your company deals with and enter them in the **Tariff Numbers** page.

In the **Tariff Numbers** page, add all the codes that you use. You must enter the codes on the item card before you begin to post. When you have set up the codes, enter them in the **Tariff No.** field on the item card. You must also fill in the **Net Weight** field on the item card.

# Map e-documents to purchase order lines with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

As procurement processes become more digital, the e-documents feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] plays a key role in automating how companies receive and process vendor invoices. Copilot can help by improving the mapping and matching of lines on vendor invoices to purchase orders. Copilot can reduce the time you spend on tasks that would normally require extensive search, lookup, and data entry. Another benefit is when vendor invoices don't relate exactly with purchase orders. Copilot can identify the corresponding purchase orders. Enhanced matching capabilities particularly benefit small and mid-sized organizations that need efficient document tracking for purchase order lines.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

The **E-Document** app supports scenarios for e-documents throughout the sales process. Copilot can also refine how you manage e-documents in the purchase process, particularly with respect to purchase orders. The app lets you specify the type of purchase document to create for each vendor when you receive e-invoices from them.

You can update existing purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the information from you received in the e-invoice.

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Prerequisites

- Your admin must activate the **E-Document Matching Assistance** capability. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).  

## Identify purchase orders

First, you can identify the purchase orders that you can automatically match. If your **Vendor** configured the **Receive E-Document To** field to work with **Purchase Orders**, when the electronic document is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (manually or from an external endpoint), [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does the following:

1. If the purchase order for this vendor exists and there's a purchase order number in the received e-document file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically links the e-document with the purchase order. The **Document Status** of this **E-Document** is **In Progress**, and the **E-Document Status** in the **Service Status** subpage is **Order linked**.  
The link shows in the **Document** field on the e-document. If you need to change the purchase order, you can use the **Update Purchase Order Link** action and then manually choose another purchase order for this vendor. You can only do so before you match the lines on the e-document and purchase order.  
2. If the purchase order for this vendor exists but there isn't a purchase order number in the received e-document file, if you manually upload the document you can choose an existing purchase order by opening the **Purchase Orders** list from the orders that you got from vendors that contain only e-document. If you don't select the correct purchase order, or if you received the e-document automatically from an external endpoint using the **Job Queue**, the new e-document isn't linked with a purchase document and the **Document Status** field shows **Error** and the **E-Document Status** in the **Service Status** subpage is **Imported document processing error**. To finish linking the purchase order, choose the **Update Purchase Order Link** action, and then choose a purchase order for the vendor.  

## Map lines

Copilot helps you automatically match e-invoice lines with purchase order lines, and offers extra matching intelligence to improve the matches.

After they're matched and mapped, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the matched purchase order with the relevant receipt information to ensure the correct quantities are received on the order lines.

You can match your received electronic documents with purchase order lines from two different places, from the **E-Documents** page or from the **Purchase Order** page. The easiest way to find purchase orders that are already linked is to use the **Linked Purchase Orders** tile on your Role Center. To find documents that aren't linked, use the **Waiting Purchase E-Invoices** tile to open a list of e-documents that are waiting for review.  

> [!NOTE]
> The **E-Document Activities** group with these two tiles is available in the following Role Centers:
>
> - Business Manager Evaluation
> - Business Manager
> - Accountant
> - Inventory Manager
> - Shipping and Receiving

When you want to run matching from a purchase order, select the **Map E-Document Lines with Copilot** action. The action is available on the **Purchase Orders** list page and the **Purchase Order** page. If you want to run matching from the **E-Documents** page, select the **Match Purchase Order with Copilot** action. To process with matching, follow these steps:

1. Select the **Map E-Document Lines with Copilot** or **Match Purchase Order with Copilot** action for documents that are already linked.  
1. The **E-Document Match Order Lines with Copilot** prompt displays and the **Purchase Order Matching** page in the background. Copilot is automatically creating the mapping for you.
1. After a few seconds, the **E-Document Match Order Lines with Copilot** page suggests lines for matching with a few details:

    1. The prompt header has the following information:

    |Field name |Description |
    |--------|-----------------|
    |Auto-matched | Specifies the number of matches proposed automatically. This number is based on a string comparison. If 80% or more of the descriptions overlap, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches them automatically without using Copilot capabilities. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also shows lines as auto-matched as item references exist with appropriate conditions. |
    |Copilot matched | Specifies the number of matches proposed by Copilot using both string and semantic comparison. |
    |E-Document No. | Specifies the linked e-document number. |
    |Invoice Total Amount Excl. VAT | Specifies the total invoice amount excluding VAT. |
    |Matched Total Amount Incl. VAT | Specifies the matched amount excluding VAT. |

    1. If all lines match, the following text displays in green font in the upper-right corner, **All lines (100%) are matched. Review match proposals**.  
    1. The **Matched proposal** lines contain the following information:  

       |Field name |Description |
       |--------|-----------------|
       |E-Document Line No. | Specifies the e-document line number from the original e-document file. |
       |E-Document Line Description | Specifies the e-document line description from the original e-document file. |
       |Matched Quantity | Specifies the quantity that is applied to the purchase order line. |
       |Proposal | Specifies the action that Copilot proposed for matching the purchase order lines. |
       |Learn Matching Rule | Specifies whether to create a matching rule for this proposal. If you select this checkbox, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates item references for items and text to account mappings for G/L accounts. |

    1. All fully suggested and matched lines are marked with green color. If there's an issue, for example, a different price but within the allowed price range, this line is marked with a yellow color. If there's any similarity between the description fields but the price difference is larger than allowed, this line is marked with a red color.
    1. If you aren't satisfied with some suggestions, you can delete them using the **Delete Line** action.  
    1. If you want to see proposal matchings, you can select the link in the **Proposal** column to open the **E-Document Match Details** page.
    1. On the **E-Document Match Details** page you can compare details from the **E-Documents** and **Purchase Order**, to be sure about the suggested matching before confirming it.
    1. After reviewing, close the page.

1. If you aren't satisfied with most of the suggestions, or if you don't want to use the **E-Document Match Order Lines with Copilot** feature, select **Discard it**. You can create the matches manually. To learn more, go to[manual matching](finance-how-use-edocuments-purchase.md).  
1. If you want to keep suggestions, select **Keep it**.
1. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] closes the Copilot prompt and lines on the **Purchase Order Matching** page are marked as green.  
1. You can continue to work as if you're doing a manual matching. For example, you can remove, create, or reset matches. If you don't want to change anything, just select the **Apply To Purchase Order** action and continue to work with the purchase order.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also select the **Match with Copilot** action from the **Purchase Order Matching** page again. If you do, you're asked whether you want to overwrite the existing matches.  

> [!NOTE]
> Price/Cost analysis and the check for available quantity are preprocessing activities.

# The Image Analyzer Extension

The Image Analyzer extension uses powerful image analytics provided by the Computer Vision API for Azure Cognitive Services to detect attributes in the images that you import for items and contact persons, so you can easily review and assign them. For items, attributes could be whether the item is a table or a car, and whether it is red or blue. For contact persons, attributes can be gender or age.

Image Analyzer suggests attributes based on tags that the Computer Vision API finds, and a confidence level. By default, it suggests attributes only if it is at least 80% sure that the attribute is correct. You can set another confidence level, if needed. To learn more about how the tags and confidence level are determined, see [Computer Vision API](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=851476).  

Image Analyzer is free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], but there is a limit to the number of items that you can analyze during a certain period of time. By default, you can analyze 100 images per month.

After you enable the extension, Image Analyzer runs each time you import an image to an item or contact person. You will see the attributes, confidence level, and details right away, and can decide what to do with each attribute. If you imported images before you enabled the Image Analyzer extension, you must go to the item or contact cards and choose the **Analyze Picture** action.  

## Privacy notice

This extension uses the Computer Vision API from Azure Cognitive Services, which may have varying levels of compliance commitments than [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you enable the Image Analyzer extension, Customer Data such as a contact image or an item image will be sent to the Computer Vision API. By installing this extension, you agree for this limited set of data to be sent to the Computer Vision API. Note that you may disable, and uninstall, the Image Analyzer extension at any time to discontinue use of this functionality. For more information, see [Microsoft Trust Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=851463).

## Requirements

There are a few requirements for the images:

* Image formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP  
* Maximum file size: Less than 4 MB  
* Image dimensions: Greater than 50 x 50 pixels  

## Switch on the Image Analyzer extension

The Image Analyzer extension is built in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You just need to switch it on.

> [!NOTE]  
> To enable the Image Analyzer extension, you must be an administrator. Make sure that you are assigned the **SUPER** user permission set. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

    > [!TIP]  
    > The **Image Analysis Setup** page is also where you can change the degree of confidence for attribute suggestions. For example, if you want to require a greater degree of confidence, you can enter a higher percentage.

## Analyze an item image

The following steps describe how to analyze an image that was imported before you enabled the Image Analyzer extension.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the item, and then choose the **Analyze Picture** action.  
3. The **Image Analyzer Attributes** page displays the detected attributes, the confidence level, and other details about the attribute. Use the **Action to perform** options to specify what to do with the attribute or choose **Add to item description** to add the name of the attribute to the item description. For example, this action can be useful for quickly adding detail.

The **Action to perform** field has following options:

| Action | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| *Ignore* | No actions will be performed. |
| *Use as attribute* | The value is added to the item attributes. Learn more at [Work with Item Attributes](inventory-how-work-item-attributes.md). |
| *Use as a category* | The selected value is added as a category. Learn more at [Categorize Items](inventory-how-categorize-items.md). |
| *Add to blocklist* | If the analysis suggests an attribute that you do not want to see, you can block the attribute. Use caution, however. Blocked attributes are not suggested for other items either. If you regret blocking an attribute, choose **View Blocked Attributes**, and then delete the attribute from the list. |

> [!NOTE]  
> By default **Item Attributes** displays attributes where **Confidence Score** is above **Confidence Score Threshold %** defined in the **Image Analysis Setup**. To see all detected attributes, choose the **View All Attributes** action.

## Analyze a contact person picture

The following steps describe how to analyze an image that was imported before you enabled the Image Analyzer extension.

# Set up inventory valuation and costing

To make sure that inventory costs are recorded correctly, you must set up various fields and pages before you begin to make item transactions. Typically, businesses choose a specific costing method and apply that to inventory items, for example, to help them track the value of items on stock.  

> [!TIP]
> For an introduction to costing in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], see [About Inventory Costing](finance-learn-about-costing.md).

# Transferring and posting cost entries

Before you define cost allocations, you must understand how cost entries come from the following sources:  

- Automatic transfer of general ledger entries.  
- Manual cost posting for pure cost entries, internal charges, and manual allocations.  
- Automatic allocation postings for actual costs.  
- Transfer of budget entries to actual.

## Criteria for transferring general ledger entries to cost entries

It's important to understand the criteria for transferring general ledger entries to cost entries. During the transfer, the **Transfer GL Entries to CA** batch job uses the following criteria to determine if and how the general ledger entries are transferred.  

General ledger entries are transferred if:  

- The entries have dimension values corresponding to either a cost center or a cost object.  
- The entries have dimension values that correspond to a cost center and a cost object. For these entries, the cost center takes precedence. This helps avoid a situation where a cost type appears in both a cost object and a cost center and is therefore counted twice in the statistics.  
- The document number in the entries is empty, so it will appear with a document number of 0000 in the cost entries.  
- The entries are transferred to a cost type that allows for combined entries and these entries are transferred as a combined entry either monthly or daily.  

General ledger entries aren't transferred if:  

- The entries have dimension values that don't correspond to a cost center or a cost object.  
- The entries have an amount of zero.  
- The entries have a general ledger account that has been deleted.  
- The entries have a general ledger account that isn't of the type **Income Statement**.  
- The entries have a general ledger account that isn't assigned a cost type.  
- The entries have a posting date before the **Starting Date for G/L Transfer**.  
- The entries have been posted with a closing date. These are typically entries that set back the balance of the income statement at the end of the year.

## Transferring general ledger entries to cost entries

You can transfer general ledger entries to cost entries.  

Before you run the process for transferring general ledger entries to cost entries, you must prepare the transfer to avoid manual correction posting.  

### To prepare the transfer  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cost Accounting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Cost Accounting Setup** page, verify that the **Starting Date for G/L Transfer** field is set to the correct value.  
3.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Cost Types**, and then choose the related link.  
4.  On the **Cost Type Card** page, verify that the **G/L Account Range** field is linked correctly for each cost type to take entries from the general ledger.  
5.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
6.  For each relevant general ledger account, on the **G/L Account Card** page, verify that the **Cost Type No.** field is linked correctly to a cost type. For more information, see [Setting Up Cost Accounting](finance-set-up-cost-accounting.md).  
7.  Verify that all relevant general ledger entries have dimension values that correspond to a cost center and a cost object.  

### To transfer general ledger entries to cost entries

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer GL Entries to CA**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Yes** button to start the transfer. The process transfers all general ledger entries that haven't already been transferred.  

During the transfer, the process creates connections in the entries in the **Cost Entry** table and the **Cost Register** table. This makes it possible to trace the source of cost entries.

## Automatic transfer and combined entries

In cost accounting, you can transfer general ledger entries to a cost type by using a combined posting. You can specify if a cost type receives combined entries in the **Combine Entries** field in the cost type definition. The following table describes the different options.  

|Combine Entries|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|None|Each general ledger entry is transferred individually to the corresponding cost type.|  
|Day|General ledger entries with the same posting date are transferred as one entry to the corresponding cost type.|  
|Month|All general ledger entries in the same calendar month are transferred as one entry to the corresponding cost type.|  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you have selected the **Auto Transfer from G/L** check box on the **Cost Accounting Setup** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the cost accounting after every posting in the general ledger. Combined entries are not possible.

## Results of transferring general ledger entries to cost entries

During the transfer of general ledger entries to cost entries, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates connections in the entries in the **G/L Entry** table, the **Cost Entry** table, and the **Cost Register** table to make it possible to trace the connections between cost entries and general ledger entries.  

### General ledger entries

For each general ledger entry that is transferred to cost accounting, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fills the cost **Entry No.** field.  

### Cost entries

For each cost entry, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] saves the entry number of the corresponding general ledger entry in the **G/L Entry No.** field in the **Cost Entry** table.  

For combined cost entries, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] saves the entry number of the last general ledger entry, which is the entry with the highest entry number.  

The **G/L Account** field in the **Cost Entry** table contains the number of the general ledger account that the cost entry came from.  

For single cost entries, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] transfers the posting text from the general ledger entry to the **Description** text field. For combined entries, the text field shows these entries are transferred as combined entries. For example, for a combined entry for the month of October in 2013, the text can be **Combined Entries, October 2013**.  

### Cost register

In the **Cost Register** table, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an entry with the source transfer from general ledger. The entry records the first and last entry numbers of the general ledger entries that are transferred, in addition to the first, and last entry numbers of the cost entries that are created.

# Enable picking items by FEFO

First-Expired-First-Out (FEFO) is a sorting method that ensures that items with the earliest expiration dates are picked first.  

 This functionality only works when the following criteria are met:

- The item must be assigned an item tracking code where the **SN Warehouse Tracking**, **Lot Warehouse Tracking**, or **Package Warehouse Tracking** fields are selected. The item must be posted to inventory with an expiration date.
- On the location, the **Pick According to FEFO** toggle must be turned on.

Depending on which document you plan to use, make some more settings:

- **Inventory Pick**. You can use picking by FEFO for locations with and without bins.
- **Warehouse Pick**. On the location, the **Bin Mandatory** toggles must be turned on.

When all the criteria are met, the serial/lot-numbered items to pick are sorted with the oldest first in all picks and movements.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If some serial or lot-numbered items have specific tracking defined in the source document, such as sales order, then those are respected first and under them, the remaining, non-specific, serial/lot numbers are listed according to FEFO.
<br /><br />
If two serial or lot-numbered items have the same expiration date, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] selects the item with the lowest serial or lot number.
<br /><br />
When picking serial or lot-numbered items in locations set up for directed put-away and pick, only quantities in bins of the type *Pick* are picked according to FEFO.  
<br /><br />
To enable movements according to FEFO, leave the **From Bin** field empty on the **Inventory Movement** or **Movement Worksheet** pages.  
<br /><br />
If the **Strict Expiration Posting** field is selected on the **Item Tracking Code Card**, only items that aren't expired are included in the pick, and the lines are sorted according to the FEFO principle.
<br /><br />
> If you posted the item to inventory without an expiration date, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] populates the serial or lot number as a warehouse pick, but not an inventory pick.

# Set up nondeductible VAT

Nondeductible value-added tax (VAT) is the VAT that's payable by a purchaser but that isn't deductible from the purchaser's own VAT liability. Companies can usually recover VAT on the purchase of goods and services that are related to their business activities. However, in some situations, a business incurs VAT that isn't deductible. These situations are typically related to the local regulations and can differ among countries/regions. However, the model of using nondeductible or partially deductible VAT is similar. You can use proportional VAT to calculate VAT when there's deductible and nondeductible VAT.

In general, VAT can't be deducted for some purchases because of the following factors:

- **The type of goods or services that are purchased** – VAT is fully or partially nondeductible according to the law about goods such as cars, mobile phones, and food purchased at restaurants.
- **Partially deductible pro-rated VAT** – VAT is pro-rated according to the ratio between the sales operations that VAT is owed for and all performed operations. VAT that exceeds this ratio can't be deducted.

Because it can be difficult to know where and how an item is used, contact the local tax authorities in your country/region. They can help determine whether you can deduct a specified percentage of the VAT, based on historical data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This global feature is available in all countries with enabled VAT **except for Belgium, Italy, and Norway**. These localizations already have existing local feature and will be upgraded in the future. Don't run this feature in these countries because the upgrade procedure doesn't exist.

## Use nondeductible VAT

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the **Enable Non-Deductible VAT** checkbox.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > After you enable non-deductible VAT, you can't turn it off, because the feature might include changes to data and might initiate an upgrade of some database tables. Microsoft strongly recommends that you first enable and test this feature in the sandbox environment before you enable it in the production environment.

3. Configure how the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] treats nondeductible VAT values.

    1. In the **Use For Item Cost** field, specify whether the nondeductible VAT must be added to the item cost when you purchase items. Otherwise, the nondeductible VAT won't influence the item cost and the full amount is recorded only at the general ledger level.
    2. Select the **Use For Fixed Asset Cost** checkbox to add the nondeductible VAT to the fixed asset cost when you purchase new fixed assets. Otherwise, the nondeductible VAT won't influence the fixed asset cost and the full amount is recorded only at the general ledger level.
    3. Select the **Use For Job Cost** checkbox to specify that the nondeductible VAT must be added to the project cost when you purchase items for the project. Otherwise, the nondeductible VAT  won't influence the project cost and the full amount is recorded only at the general ledger level.
    4. Select the **Show Non-Ded. VAT In Lines** checkbox to specify that the nondeductible VAT must be shown on document line pages for easier manipulation of VAT amounts.

## Use the nondeductible VAT percentage

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **VAT Posting Setup** page, set the fields as described in the following table.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Allow Non-Deductible VAT** | Specify whether the nondeductible VAT is considered for the current combination of a VAT business posting group and a VAT product posting group. |
    | **Non-Deductible VAT %** | Specify the percentage of the transaction amount that VAT isn't applied to. |
    | **Non- Deductible Purchase VAT Account** | Specify the account associated with the VAT amount that isn't deducted because of the type of goods or services that are purchased. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > To have general ledger (G/L) entries that use the dedicated account instead of the sales/purchase account, you can either leave the **Non-Deductible Purchase VAT Account** field blank or set the **G/L Account** field.

3. Select **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use unrealized VAT together with non-deductible VAT.
>
> Don't use the same **VAT identifier** value for both normal VAT where the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field is set to **0** (zero) and normal VAT where the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field is set to a non-zero value. Otherwise, the total non-deductible VAT amount will be incorrectly calculated.

# Manage Many Incoming Document Records

As you create or process incoming document records, the number of lines on the **Incoming Documents** page may grow to an extent where you lose overview. Therefore, you can set incoming document records to *Processed* to remove them from the default view. When you choose the **Show All** action, you can view both processed and unprocessed records.

> [!NOTE]  
> You cannot edit information, attach files, or perform other processes on incoming document records that are set to *Processed*. You must first set it to *Unprocessed*.

The **Processed** check box is automatically selected on incoming document records that have been processed, but you can also select or deselect the check box manually. Depending on your business process, an incoming document record may be processed when a related document has been created for it or a file has been attached.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you open the **Incoming Documents** page with the **My Incoming Documents** action on the Role Center, only unprocessed incoming document records are shown by default. This is referred to in this topic as "the default view".

## To remove incoming document records from the default view

1. On the **Incoming Documents** page, select one or more lines for incoming document records that you want to remove from the default view.
2. Choose the **Set to Processed** action.

    The incoming document records are removed from the default view, and the **Processed** check box is selected on the lines.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also perform this action for the individual record on the **Incoming Document Card** page.

## To view all incoming document records

1. On the **Incoming Documents** page, choose the **Show All** action.

All incoming document records are displayed, including records where the **Processed** check box isn't selected.

## To add incoming document records to the default view

1. On the **Incoming Documents** page, choose the **Show All** action.
2. Select one or more lines for incoming document records that you want to appear in the default view.
3. Choose the **Set to Unprocessed** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also perform this action for the individual record on the **Incoming Document Card** page.

# Restrict and allow usage of a record

If you want to restrict a record from being used in certain activities, for example, until the record has been approved, you can add two workflow responses in the workflow that controls the use of the record. One workflow response restricts usage of the record as defined by the workflow event and conditions. The other workflow response allows the use of the record as defined by the workflow event and conditions. Two responses exist in the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for this purpose: **Add record restriction** and **Remove record restriction**.

> [!NOTE]  
> The default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers support for restricting a record from being posted, from being exported as a payment, and from being printed as a check. To support other restrictions, a Microsoft partner must customize the application code.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The workflow functionality to restrict and allow records from being used is not related to the functionality to block item, customer, and vendor records from being posted.

The following procedure describes how to restrict purchase orders from being posted until they've been approved. The new workflow is based on the *Purchase Invoice Approval Workflow* template.  

## Create a workflow step that restricts posting of unapproved purchase orders

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Workflows** page, choose the **New Workflow from Template** action. Learn more at [Create Workflows from Workflow Templates](across-how-to-create-workflows-from-workflow-templates.md).
3. On the **Workflow Templates** page, choose the *Purchase Invoice Approval Workflow* template.  

   Note that the first two workflow steps are about restricting and then allowing usage of purchase invoices. Change the event condition on the first step of the new workflow to specify that it applies to purchase orders.  
4. On the **Workflow Steps** FastTab, choose the **On Condition** field for the first step, then, for the **Document Type** filter, select **Order**.  
5. Proceed to edit, delete, or add other workflow steps to reflect a business process that begins by restricting unapproved purchase orders from being posted.

# The WorldPay Payments Standard extension

> [!CAUTION]
> The WorldPay Payments Standard extension will be deprecated. The code is marked as obsolete starting in 2023 release wave 2. The app will be active for the next three major releases and then it will be removed.

The WorldPay Payments Standard extension lets you offer customers a convenient alternative to making payments through bank transfers or credit cards. Not only that, payments made through payment services will typically land in your bank account more quickly.

If you enable the extension, when you send a sales invoice by email the document includes a link to the payment service in the email body and in the attached PDF document. A customer can choose the link, and then use the payment service to make the payment.

Enabling payment service extensions is free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], however, you'll need to contact the payment service to get an account. For more information, see [Enable Customer Payment Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

# Business Central for Multi-Site and International Organizations
Organizations that have multiple sites often use a hub-and-spoke business model where a parent company, or headquarters, manages the overall operations of the business while each site functions as a single, standalone entity. Sites are often geographically distributed and have different needs for sharing information with the headquarter company. Additionally, sites typically don't need the same level of complexity, and often lack the resources to maintain a large system.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives small and mid-sized businesses a business management solution that's easy-to-use and maintain at a low cost of ownership.

This article introduces some of the ways in which [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports a hub-and-spoke business model.

## Integrating the Headquarter Company and the Sites

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can integrate with the headquarter company's accounting system while meeting the varying needs of different sites, regardless of size, location, or type of business.

The following diagram is an example of different sites integrated with a headquarter company.

![Diagram Description automatically generated.](media/multisite-headquarter-sites.png)

## Meet the Needs of Domestic and International Sites

Business needs at sites often differ based on industry, business methods, or their relationship to the headquarter company. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can be easily adapted and extended for various types of businesses and locales. Microsoft AppSource offers a wealth of apps from Microsoft and our partners, and partners can quickly deploy [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with minimal disruption to daily operations.

For multi-national organizations, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports local legal requirements and business practices.

* For online versions, there are more than [40 localized country/region versions](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json) that you can install as extensions from Microsoft AppSource.  
* For on-premises versions, [country/region versions](/azure/architecture/solution-ideas/articles/business-central) are available either as Microsoft-localized versions or partner-led add-on localizations.

A network of more than 4,000 Microsoft partners world-wide provides local expertise.

## Consolidate Financial Data

A core facet of the hub-and-spoke business model is the ability for the headquarter company and sites to exchange financial data, even when the headquarter company and sites use different systems, accounting structures, languages, and currencies.

| Connect to 3<sup>rd</sup> party solutions and services. | APIs establish a point-to-point connection between Business Central and 3<sup>rd</sup> party solutions and services. | [API v2.0](/dynamics-nav/api-reference/v2.0/) |


## Promote an Efficient Intercompany Supply Chain

Sites often need access to the supply chain, and the ability to manage certain aspects of it. For example, sites might use the same vendor, but manage their assets and physical locations separately.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Treat inter-divisional transactions as normal sales and purchase transactions. | Use inter-company postings to create sales and purchase documents and general ledger entries for entire workflows, and for more than one company at a time to eliminate duplicate data entry. | [Managing Inter-company Transactions](intercompany-manage.md) |

## Respond Quickly to New Business Conditions

The headquarter company must be able to react quickly to business changes at each site. Combined with Power Automate, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can serve as an early warning mechanism.

# Process sales returns or cancellations

If a customer wants to return items or be reimbursed for items or services that you have sold and received payment for, you must create and post a sales credit memo that specifies the requested change. To include the correct sales invoice information, you can do the following tasks:  

- Create the sales credit memo directly from the posted sales invoice.
- Create a new sales credit memo with copied invoice information.

If you need more control of the sales return process, such as warehouse documents for the item handling, or a better overview when receiving items from multiple sales documents with one sales return, then you can create sales return orders. A sales return order automatically issues the related sales credit memo and other return-related documents, such as a replacement sales order, if needed. For more information, see [Process sales return orders](sales-how-process-sales-returns-orders.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If a posted sales invoice has not yet been paid, then you can use the **Correct** or **Cancel** functions on the posted sales invoice to reverse transactions. These functions only work for unpaid invoices, and they do not support partial returns or cancellations. For more information, see [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Sales Invoices](sales-how-correct-cancel-sales-invoice.md).

A return or reimbursement might relate to only some of the items or services on the original sales invoice. In that case, you must edit information on the lines on the sales credit memo or sales return order. When you post the sales credit memo or sales return order, the sales documents that are affected by the change are reversed and a refund payment can be created for the customer. For more information, see [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).  

The credit memo posting will also revert any item charges that were assigned to the posted document, so that the item's value entries are the same as before the item charge was assigned.

> [!NOTE]
> The bookkeeping aspects of sales returns, such as the payments to customers as reimbursement, is considered bookkeeping work and not described here. For more information, see [Managing Payables](payables-manage-payables.md).

## To create a sales credit memo from a posted sales invoice  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Posted Sales Invoices** page, select the posted sales invoice that you want to reverse, choose the **Cancel** action, and then choose the **Create Corrective Credit Memo** action.

    The sales credit memo header contains some information from the posted sales invoice. You can edit this, for example, with new information that reflects the return agreement.  
3. Edit information on the lines according to the agreement, such as the number of returned items or the amount to reimburse.
4. Choose the **Prepare** action, and then choose the **Apply Entries** action.
5. On the **Apply Customer Entries** page, select the line with the posted sales document that you want to apply the sales credit memo to, and then choose the **Applies-to ID** action.

    The identifier of the sales credit memo displays in the **Applies-to ID** field.
6. In the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount that you want to apply if it's smaller than the original amount.  

    At the bottom of the **Apply Customer Entries** page, you can see the total amount to apply to reverse all involved entries, namely when the value in the **Balance** field is zero.
7. Choose the **OK** button. When you post the sales credit memo, it is applied to the posted sales documents.

    After you create or edit sales credit memo lines, and the single or multiple applications are specified, you can post the sales credit memo.  
8. Choose the **Posting** action, then choose the **Post and Send** action.  

The **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box opens showing the preferred sending method for the customer. You can change the sending method by choosing the lookup button for the **Send Document** to field. For more information, see [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).  

The posted sales documents that you applied the credit memo to are now reversed, and a refund payment can be created for the customer. The sales credit memo is removed and replaced with a new document in the list of posted sales credit memos.

## To create a sales credit memo by copying a posted sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty sales credit memo.
3. In the **Customer Name** field, enter the name of an existing customer.
4. Choose the **Prepare** action, then choose the **Copy Document** action.
5. On the **Copy Sales Document** page, in the **Document Type** field, select **Posted Invoice**.
6. Choose the **Document No.** field to open the **Posted Sales Invoices** page, and then select the posted sales invoice record that contains lines that you want to reverse.
7. Select the **Recalculate Lines** check box if you want the copied posted sales invoice lines to be updated with any changes in item price and unit cost since the invoice was posted.
8. Choose the **OK** button. The copied invoice lines are inserted in the sales credit memo.
9. Complete the sales credit memo as explained in [To create a sales credit memo from a posted sales invoice](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-sales-credit-memo-from-a-posted-sales-invoice).

## To create a sales allowance
You can send a customer a credit memo with a price reduction if the customer has received slightly damaged items or received the items late.  
You can post this reduced price as an item charge in a credit memo or a return order and assign it to the posted shipment. The following describes it for a sales credit memo, but the same steps apply to a sales return order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty sales credit memo.
3. Fill in the credit memo header with relevant information about the customer that you want to give the sales allowance to.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select **Charge (Item)**.  
5. In the **No.** field, select the appropriate item charge value.  
     You might want to create a special item charge number to cover sales allowances.  
6. In the **Quantity** field, enter **1**.  
7. In the **Unit Price Excl. Tax** field, enter the amount of the sales allowance.  
8. Assign the sales allowance as an item charge to the items in the posted shipment. For more information, see [Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md). When you have assigned the allowance, return to the **Sales Credit Memo** page.  

When you post the sales return order, the sales allowance is added to the relevant sales entry amount. In this way, you can maintain accurate inventory valuation.

## To combine return receipts
You can combine return receipts if your customer returns several items that are covered by different sales return orders.  

When you receive the items into your warehouse, post the relevant sales return orders as received. This creates posted return receipts.  

When you're ready to invoice this customer, instead of invoicing each sales return order separately, you can create a sales credit memo and automatically copy the posted return receipt lines to this document. Then you can post the sales credit memo and conveniently invoice all the open sales return orders at once.  

To combine return receipts, the **Combine Shipments** check box must be selected on the **Customer Card** page.  

### To manually combine return receipts  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **Get Return Receipt Lines** action.  
5. Select the return receipt lines that you want to include in the credit memo:  

    - To insert all lines, select all lines, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    - To insert specific lines, select the lines, and then choose the **OK** button.  
6.  If an incorrect shipment line was selected or you want to start over, you can simply delete the lines on the credit memo and rerun the **Get Return Receipt Lines** function.  
7.  Post the invoice.  

### To automatically combine return receipts

You can automatically combine return receipts and have the option of automatically posting the credit memos using the  **Combine Return Receipts** function.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Combine Return Receipts**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Combine Return Receipts** page, fill in the fields to select the relevant return receipts.
3. Select the **Post Credit Memos** check box. If not, you must manually post the resulting purchase credit memos.
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

### To remove a received and invoiced return order

When you invoice return receipts in this way, the return orders from which the return receipts were posted still exist, even if they have been fully received and invoiced.  

When return receipts are combined on a credit memo and posted, a posted sales credit memo is created for the credited lines. The **Quantity Invoiced** field on the originating sales return order is updated based on the invoiced quantity.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Sales Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Specify in the **No.** filter field which return orders to delete.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

Alternatively, delete individual sales return orders manually.  

## Inventory costing

To preserve correct inventory valuation, you typically want to put returned items back in inventory at the unit cost that they were sold at, not at their current unit cost. This is referred to as exact cost reversing.

Two functions exist to assign exact cost reversing automatically:  

|Function|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function on the **Sales Return Order** page|Copies lines of one or more posted documents to be reversed into the sales return order. For more information, see [Create a sales return order based on one or more posted sales documents](sales-how-process-sales-returns-orders.md#create-a-sales-return-order-based-on-one-or-more-posted-sales-documents).|  
|**Copy Document** function in the **Sales Credit Memo** and **Sales Return Order** pages|Copies both the header and lines of one posted document to be reversed.<br /><br /> Requires that the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** check box is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.|

To assign exact cost reversing manually, you must choose the **Appl.-from Item Entry** field on any type of return document line, and then select the number of the original sales entry. This links the sales credit memo or sales return order to the original sales entry and ensures that the item is valued at the original unit cost.

For more information, see [Design Details: Inventory Costing](design-details-inventory-costing.md).

# Work with general journals

Most financial transactions are posted to the general ledger through documents such as purchase invoices and sales orders. However by posting journal lines, you can also process business activities such as:

* Purchasing
* Payments
* Using recurring journals to post accruals
* Refunding employee expenses

Most journals are based on the general journal, and you can process all transactions on the **General Journals** page. Learn more at [Post Transactions Directly to the General Ledger](finance-how-post-transactions-directly.md).  

For example, you can use post employee expenses for reimbursement. Learn more at [Record and Reimburse Employees' Expenses](finance-how-record-reimburse-employee-expenses.md).

However, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also offers journals that are optimized for specific types of transactions, such as the *Payment Journal* for registering payments. Learn more at [Record Payments and Refunds in the Payment Journal](payables-how-post-payments-refunds.md).  

You use general journals to post financial transactions to general ledger accounts and various other accounts. The other accounts include bank, customer, vendor, and employee accounts. Posting with a general journal creates entries on general ledger accounts even when, for example, you post a journal line to a customer account. The entry is posted to a general ledger receivables account through a posting group.

The information that you enter in a journal is temporary and can be changed while it's in the journal. When you post the journal, the information is transferred to entries on individual accounts, where it can't be changed. You can, however, unapply posted entries, and you can post reversing or correcting entries. Learn more at [Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments](finance-how-reverse-journal-posting.md).

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip](includes/journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip.md)]  

## Add context to general journal transactions

When you create a journal, you can add links that give context to its transactions. When you post the journal, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] copies the links to the posted journal and ledger entries the journal creates. For example, providing links can make life easier for your auditor. If you keep images of your expense receipts on your company's Sharepoint site, you can add links to the files. When you post the journal to submit your expenses, your auditor can quickly get to the receipt files.

## Use journal templates and batches

There are several general journal templates. Each journal template is represented by a dedicated page with particular functions and the fields that are required to support those functions, such as the **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page to process bank payments and the **Payment Journals** page to pay your vendors or reimburse your employees. Learn more at [Make Payments](payables-make-payments.md) and [Reconcile Customer Payments with the Cash Receipt Journal or from Customer Ledger Entries](receivables-how-apply-sales-transactions-manually.md).

For each journal template, you can set up your own personal journal as a journal batch. For example, you can define your own journal batch for the payment journal that has your personal layout and settings. The following tip is an example of how to personalize a journal.

> [!TIP]  
> If you select the **Suggest Balancing Amount** checkbox on the line for your batch on the **General Journal Batches** page, then the **Amount** field on, for example, general journal lines for the same document number is automatically prefilled with the value that is required to balance the document. Learn more at [Letting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Suggest Values](ui-let-system-suggest-values.md).

> [!TIP]
> You can add or remove fields in journals by personalizing them. Learn more at [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

### Validating general journal batches

You can turn on a background check that helps prevent delays when posting. The check notifies you when a mistake in the financial journal you're working on will prevent you from posting the journal. On the **General Journal Batches** page, you can choose **Background Error Check** to have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] validate finance journals, such as general or payment journals, while you're working on them.

When you enable the validation, the **Check Document** or **Journal Check** FactBoxes show issues in the current line and the whole batch. Validation happens when you load a finance journal batch, and when you choose another journal line. The **Issues total** tile in the FactBox shows the total number of issues that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] found, and you can choose it to open an overview of the issues.

You can use the **Show Lines with Issues** and **Show All Lines** actions to toggle between journal lines that do or don't have issues. The **Journal Line Details** FactBox provides quick overview and access to data from journal lines, such as the G/L account, customer, or vendor, and the posting setup for specific accounts.

[!INCLUDE [background_doc_journal_check](includes/background_doc_journal_check.md)]  

## Understanding main accounts and balancing accounts

If you set up default balancing accounts for the journal batches on the **General Journals** page, the balancing account is filled in automatically when you fill in the **Account No.** field. Otherwise, fill in both the **Account No.** and **Bal. Account No.** fields manually. A positive amount in the **Amount** field is debited to the main account and credited to the balancing account. A negative amount is credited to the main account and debited to the balancing account.

> [!NOTE]  
> VAT is calculated separately for the main account and the balancing account, so they can use different VAT percentage rates.

## Work with recurring journals

A recurring journal is a general journal with specific fields for managing transactions that you often post with few, if any, changes. For example, transactions for expenses such as rent, subscriptions, electricity, and heat. Using recurring journals lets you post fixed and variable amounts, and specify automatic reversal entries for the day after the posting date. Allocation keys let you divide the recurring entries among various accounts. Learn more at [Allocating Recurring Journal Amounts to Several Accounts](#allocating-recurring-journal-amounts-to-several-accounts).

With a recurring journal, you create the entries that you post regularly only one time. For example, the accounts, dimensions, dimension values, and so on, stay in the journal after posting. If changes are needed, you can make them each time you post.

### Recurring Method field

The **Recurring Method** field is important. It determines how to treat the amount on the journal line after posting. For example, if you use the same amount every time you post the line, you can let the amount remain. If you'll use the same accounts and text on the line, but the amount varies every time you post, you can delete the amount after posting.

| To | See |
| --- | --- |
|F Fixed|The amount on the journal line remains after posting. Lines with amounts of zero remain in the journal, but aren't posted. You can update the amount in a later run.  |
|V Variable|The amount on the journal line is deleted after posting.|
|B Balance|The posted amount on the account on the line is allocated among the accounts specified for the line in the Gen. Jnl. Allocation table. The balance on the account is set to zero. Remember to fill in the **Allocation %** field on the **Allocations** page. For more information, see [Allocating Recurring Journal Amounts to Several Accounts](#allocating-recurring-journal-amounts-to-several-accounts).|
|RF Reversing Fixed|The amount on the journal line remains after posting, and a balancing entry is posted on the next day.|
|RV Reversing Variable|The amount on the journal line is deleted after posting, and a balancing entry is posted on the next day.|
|RB Reversing Balance|The posted amount on the account on the line is allocated among the accounts specified for the line on the **Allocations** page. The balance on the account is set to zero, and a balancing entry is posted on the next day.|
|BD Balance by Dimension|The journal line allocates costs based on a G/L account's balance by dimension. You're prompted to set the dimension filters to be used to calculate the source G/L account's balance by dimension from which you want to allocate costs. As an alternative, choose the **Set Dimension Filters** action later.|
|RBD Reversing Balance by Dimension|The journal line allocates costs based on a G/L account's reversing balance by dimension. You're prompted to set the dimension filters to use to calculate the source G/L account's balance by dimension from which you want to allocate costs. You can also choose the **Set Dimension Filters** action later.|

> [!NOTE]  
> The VAT fields can be filled in on either the recurring journal line or on the allocation journal line but not on both. That is, they can be filled in on the **Allocations** page only if the corresponding lines in the recurring journal are not filled in.

### Recurring Frequency field

This date formula field determines how often to post the entry on the journal line, and it must be filled in. Learn more at [Use Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas).

#### Examples

If the journal line must be posted every month, enter **1M**. After every posting, the date in the **Posting Date** field will be updated to the same date in the next month.

If you want to post an entry on the last day of every month, you can take one of the following actions:

* Post the first entry on the last day of a month by entering 1D+1M-1D (1 day + 1 month - 1 day). With this formula, the posting date is calculated correctly regardless of how many days there are in the month.

* Post the first entry on any day of the month by entering 1M+CM. With this formula, the posting date will be after one full month + the remaining days of the current month.

### Expiration Date field

This field determines the date on which the line is posted for the last time. The line won't be posted after this date.

The advantage of using the Expiration Date field is that the line isn't deleted from the journal immediately. You can enter a later date so that you can use the line in the future.

If the field is blank, the line is posted every time until you delete it from the journal.

### Allocating recurring journal amounts to several accounts

On the **Recurring General Journals** page, you can choose the **Allocations** action to specify how to allocate amounts on the recurring journal line to several accounts and dimensions. Allocation acts as balancing account line for the recurring journal line.

Like a recurring journal, you enter an allocation one time and it stays in the allocation journal after posting. You don't need to enter amounts and allocations every time you post the recurring journal line.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use allocation accounts in journal batches that have an approval workflow for creating journal lines.

If the recurring method in the recurring journal is set to **Balance** or **Reversing Balance**, dimension value codes in the recurring journal are disregarded when the account is set to zero. If you allocate a recurring line to dimension values on the **Allocations** page, only one reversing entry is created.

> [!NOTE]
> If you allocate a recurring journal line that contains a dimension value code, don't enter the same code on the **Allocations** page. If you do, the dimension values will be incorrect.  

To allocate recurring journal amounts based on dimensions, set the **Recurring Method** field to **Balance by Dimension** or **Reversing Balance by Dimension**. If the recurring method in the recurring journal is set to **Balance by Dimension** or **Reversing Balance by Dimension**, dimension value codes in the recurring journal are considered when the account is set to zero. If you allocate a recurring line to dimension values on the **Allocations** page, reversing entries are created that match the number of dimension value combinations that the balance is comprised of. If you allocate account balance through a recurring journal that contains a dimension value code, remember to use **Balance by Dimension** or **Reversing Balance by Dimension** to ensure that the dimension values are correctly balanced or reversed from the source account.  

For example, your company has a couple of business units and a handful of departments that your controllers set up as dimensions. To speed up the purchase invoice entry process, you decide to require the accounts payable clerks to enter only business unit dimensions. Since each business unit has specific allocation keys for the Department dimension, such as based on the number of employees, you can use the **BD Balance by Dimension** or **RBD Reversing Balance by Dimension** recurring methods to reallocate expenses for each business unit to the right departments based on the allocation keys.  

> [!NOTE]
> Dimensions that you set on allocation lines are not automatically calculated, and you must specify which dimension values must be set on the allocation accounts. In case you want to preserve the link between the source account dimension and the allocation account dimension, we recommend that you use the [Cost Accounting](finance-about-cost-accounting.md) capabilities instead.

#### Example: Allocating Rent Payments to Different Departments

You pay rent monthly, so you enter the amount on the cash account on a recurring journal line. On the **Allocations** page, you can use the Department dimension to divide the expense among several departments. For example, according to the number of square feet that each department occupies. The calculation is based on the allocation percentage on each line. You can allocate in different ways:

* Enter different accounts on different allocation lines to divide rental expense among several accounts.
* Enter the same account but use different dimension value codes for the Department dimension on each line.

[!INCLUDE [rev-general-journal](includes/rev-general-journal.md)]

### Calculate the reversal date

When using recurring general journals to post accruals at the end of a period, it's important to have full control over reversal entries. On the **Recurring General Journals** page, the **Reversal Date Calculation** field lets you control the date that reversal entries are posted when reversal recurring methods are used.

#### Example

Accruals are typically posted with **Fixed**, **Variable**, or **Balance** recurring methods on the journal line. The posting date of the posted amount on the account on journal line is calculated using the recurring frequency. The posting date for the balancing entry is calculated using the **Reversal Date Calculation** field, as follows:

* If the field is blank, the balancing entry will be posted the next day.
* If the field contains a date formula (for example, **5D** for five days), the balancing entry is posted with a posting date calculated using the reversal date calculation.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the **Reversal Date Calculation** field is not available on the **Recurring General Journals** page. To use the field, you must add it by personalizing the page. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Work with standard journals

When you create journal lines that you know you're likely to create again later, you can save them as a standard journal before you post the journal. The same applies for item journals and general journals.

> [!NOTE]
> Standard journals might not contain all of the fields you want to include in the resulting ledger entries. For example, if you're using a standard general journal to register a payment, the ledger entries won't contain the Payment Method Code field.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedures refer to the item journal, but the information also applies to the general journal.

### To save a standard journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter one or more journal lines.
3. Select the journal lines that you want to reuse.
4. Choose the **Save as Standard Journal** action.
5. In the **Save as Standard Item Journal** request page, define a new or existing standard item journal that the lines should be saved in.

    If you have one or more standard item journals, and you want to replace one of them with the new set of item journal lines, in the **Code** field, select the item journal.
6. Choose **OK** to verify that you want to replace the content of the existing standard item journal.
7. To save the values in the **Unit Amount** field of the standard item journal, choose the **Save Unit Amount** field.
8. To save the values in the **Quantity** field, choose the **Save Quantity** field.
9. Choose **OK** to save the standard item journal.

When you save the standard item journal, the Item Journal page displays so you can post it.

### To reuse a standard journal

> [!NOTE]
> Standard journals don't always have the same fields as general journals. When you use the Get Standard Journals action to copy the fields to the general journal, the general journal might have less information than if you created it manually. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Get Standard Journals** action.
3. To review a standard item journal before you select it for reuse, choose the **Show Journal** action.

    Changes you make in a standard item journal are implemented right away, and they'll be there next time you open or reuse the standard item journal. Be sure that the change is important enough to generally apply. Otherwise, make the specific change in the item journal after the standard item journal lines are added. See step 4.
4. On the **Standard Item Journals** page, select the standard item journal to reuse, and then choose **OK**.

    The item journal contains the lines you saved. If the item journal already has lines, the new lines appear after them.

    If you didn't turn on the **Save Unit Amount** toggle when you saved the journal, the **Unit Amount** field on lines added from the standard journal contain the value from the **Unit Cost** field on the item card.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you turned on the **Save Unit Amount** or **Save Quantity** toggles when you saved the journal, make sure the new values are correct before you post the item journal.
    >
    > If the inserted item journal lines contain saved unit amounts that you don't want to post, you can adjust it to the current value of the item.

5. Select the item journal lines you want to adjust, and then choose the **Recalculate Unit Amount** action. This action updates the Unit Amount field with the current unit cost of the item.
6. Choose the **Post** action.

## To renumber document numbers in journals

To avoid posting errors caused by the document number, you can use the **Renumber Document Numbers** action before you post a journal.

In all journals that are based on the general journal, the **Document No.** field is editable so that you can specify different document numbers for different journal lines or the same document number for related journal lines.

If the **No. Series** field on the journal batch is filled, then the posting function in general journals requires that the document number on individual or grouped journal lines be in sequential order. Just choose the **Renumber Document Numbers** action, and relevant **Document No.** fields are then updated. If related journal lines are grouped by document number before you used the function, they remain grouped, but might be assigned a different document number.  

This function also works on filtered views.

Renumbering document numbers respects related applications, such as a payment application made from the document on the journal line to a vendor account. Accordingly, the **Applies-to ID** and **Applies-to Doc. No.** fields are updated on the ledger entries.

### To renumber documents in journals

The following procedure is based on the **General Journals** page, but applies to all other journals that are based on the general journal, such as the **Payment Journals** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. When you're ready to post the journal, choose the **Renumber Document Numbers** action.

Values in the **Document No.** field are changed, where required, so that the document number on individual or grouped journal lines are in sequential order. After documents are renumbered, you can post the journal.

# Work with recurring revenue in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

Many companies are moving from a business revenue model where revenue is made from a customer's one-time purchase to a subscription model where revenue is made on a recurring basis in return for consistent access to the delivery of a good or service.
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has the following options for automating how you send subscription invoices to your customers and register recurring revenue. 

## Register revenue with a recurring general journal

A recurring journal is a general journal with specific fields for managing transactions that you post frequently with few or no changes, such as rent, subscriptions, electricity, or heat. Using these fields for recurring transactions, you can post both fixed and variable amounts. 
With a recurring journal, entries that are posted regularly need to be typed in only once. That is, the accounts, dimensions and dimension values, and so on, that you enter will remain in the journal after posting. If any adjustments are necessary, you can make them with each posting.

### Why use this option

With this option, you define flexible invoicing periods with [Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas).

However, with this option, you can't print and send invoices in the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

For more information, see [Work with Recurring Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md#work-with-recurring-journals).  

## Create multiple invoices based on a recurring project journal

The recurring job journal is a more advanced alternative to the general journal. You define Items, Resources, and G/L Accounts that must be repeated for each job and you specify the frequency of recurrence.  

After posting a recurring project journal, you can create multiple invoices with the **Create Job Sales Invoice** task. You can review and post created invoices in the **Sales Invoices** page.

### Why use this option

With this option, you follow the standard invoicing procedure with all the benefits of that, including standard and customer layouts for communication preferences. You can also define prices for each project individually.

However, for each new customer, you must create a new project and add lines to the recurring journal. 

For more information, see [Create project journal lines](projects-how-record-job-usage.md#to-create-project-journal-lines-manually) and [Create multiple project sales invoices](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md#to-create-multiple-project-sales-invoices).

## Create multiple invoices based on recurring sales lines

If you often need to create sales and purchase lines with similar information, you can set up recurring sales lines that you can then insert on recurring sales and purchase documents, for example, for recurring replenishment orders. Use the **Create Recurring Sales Invoices** batch job to create sales invoices according to recurring sales lines that are assigned to the customers and with posting dates within the valid-from and valid-to dates that you specify on the recurring sales lines.  

### Why use this option

With this option, you can assign the same recurring lines to multiple customers. You can define period of validity for the recurring sales lines for specific customer. You can assign multiple recurring lines to the same customer and all of them will be included in the invoice.

However, there's no way to set fixed prices for items because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the actual prices and discount valid on document date, trying to find best combination that gives the lowest price.  

For more information, see [Create Recurring Sales and Purchase Lines](sales-how-work-standard-lines.md).

## Recurring invoices with service contract

A service contract contains the service contract agreements between your customers and your company. A service contract includes service level agreements and the service items that you service as a part of the contract.  

You can define the starting date of the contract, the invoice period, whether or not the contract is prepaid, price update specifications if you plan to change prices while contract is active. You can use both service items or items in service contract lines.
You can create contract templates to define how to create certain types of contracts.  

### Why use this option

With this option, you use a part of the advanced service management functionality that not limited to issuing of recurring invoices but support repair shop and field service operations.

However, this option requires the Premium license. Setting up service management and maintaining it might not give huge advantages in simpler subscription scenarios.  

For more information, see [Work with Service Contracts and Service Contract Quotes](service-how-to-create-service-contracts-and-service-contract-quotes.md) and [Invoice several service contracts](service-how-create-invoices.md#to-invoice-several-service-contracts).

## Related features
There are several related capabilities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Blanket sales orders

A blanket sales order represents a framework for a long-term agreement between your company and your customer.
A blanket order is typically made when a customer has committed to purchasing large quantities that are to be delivered in several smaller shipments over a certain period of time. Often blanket orders cover only one item with predetermined delivery dates. The main reason for using a blanket order rather than a sales order is that quantities entered on a blanket order don't affect item availability, however it can be used for planning purposes.

#### Why use this option

With this option, you use the anticipated demand, so the information is considered during the normal planning routines. For more information, see [Demand Forecasts and Blanket Orders](design-details-central-concepts-of-the-planning-system.md#demand-forecasts-and-blanket-orders).  

However, the default version doesn't offer an out-of-the-box possibility to process multiple blanket orders in bulk.

For more information, see [Work with Blanket Sales Orders](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md).

### Recurring Orders (Norway)

You can use recurring orders to create blanket order templates so that sales orders can be created based on date intervals that you define. For example, if you deliver the same sales order every two weeks, you can use a blanket sales order and create recurring orders.
You can use recurring groups to define a range of parameters that show how you make the orders. These groups are assigned to blanket orders that have to be created regularly. To create the recurring orders, you'll have to periodically run the create recurring orders process. 

#### Why use this option

With this option, you can choose between fixed and "best" prices.

However, this is only available in Norway. Validity period can be defined on the recurring group level.

For more information, see [Recurring Orders](LocalFunctionality/Norway/recurring-orders.md).

### Recurring revenue and subscription billing by other providers

At [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/), you can get extensions for Business Central. Some extensions are provided by Microsoft, and other extensions are provided by other companies. The list of the extensions by other companies grows each month. So keep an eye out for [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646) and get apps to help you in your work in Business Central.

# Accounting and bookkeeping

Accounting is a critical function in any enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution, and also in most businesses. Accounting represents the process of recording and cataloging a company's financial transactions, and then retrieving, measuring, summarizing, and presenting the results by using different reports that are often required by local legislation. The primary goal of this process is to help the company's management understand the financials of the business and measure the results of the company's economic activities.

Bookkeeping is one part of the accounting process and involves regularly recording all financial transactions in a company. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is an ERP system that includes integrated tools to make bookkeeping easier in the system. Many actions can be done automatically.

This article provides an outline of bookkeeping processes, including the rules, procedures, and other guidelines in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The content of this article is intended to help accountants and bookkeepers complete their daily work in this ERP system. For additional help, a context-based assistant is incorporated into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This assistant contains links to information that's related to the current page and instructions for working with the relevant process.

# Reconcile customer payments with a cash receipt journal or from customer ledger entries

When you receive a cash payment from a customer or give a cash refund, you can apply the payment or refund to close open debits or credits. You can specify the amount to apply. For example, you can apply partial payments to customer ledger entries. Closing customer ledger entries keeps customer statistics, account statements, finance charges, and so on, up-to-date.

> [!TIP]  
> On the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, red font means that the related payment is past its due date. If overdue payments are becoming a problem, we can help you reduce their frequency. You can enable the **Late Payment Prediction Setup** extension, which uses a predictive model that we built in Azure Machine Learning to predict the timing of payments. These predictions help you reduce outstanding receivables and fine-tune your collections strategy. For example, if a payment is predicted to be late, you can adjust the terms of payment or the payment method for the customer. For more information, see [Late Payment Predictions](ui-extensions-late-payment-prediction.md).  

You can apply customer ledger entries in several ways:

* Enter information on the following pages:
   * The **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).
   * The **Payment Registration Setup** page. For more information, see [Reconcile Customer Payments from a List of Unpaid Sales Documents](receivables-how-reconcile-customer-payments-list-unpaid-sales-documents.md).
   * The **Cash Receipt Journals** page. For more information, see [To fill and post a cash receipt journal](#to-fill-and-post-a-cash-receipt-journal).
* By filling in the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field on sales credit memo documents. For more information, see [To apply a credit memo to a single customer ledger entry](#to-apply-a-credit-memo-to-a-single-customer-ledger-entry).
* By using the **Set Applies-to ID** action on a customer ledger entry. For more information, see [To apply a payment to a single customer ledger entry](#to-apply-a-payment-to-a-single-customer-ledger-entry).
* By using the **Apply Entries** action on the **Bank Deposit** page, and then entering the invoice number in the **Applies-to ID** field. For more information, see [Create Bank Deposits](bank-create-bank-deposits.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If the **Application Method** field on the customer card contains **Apply to Oldest**, payments are applied to the oldest open credit entry, unless you manually specify an entry. If the application method is **Manual**, you always apply entries manually.

## To fill and post a cash receipt journal

A cash receipt journal is a type of general journal. You can use it to post transactions to general ledger, bank, customer, vendor, and fixed assets accounts. You can apply the payment to one or more debit entries when you post the payment. You can also apply from the posted entries later.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Receipt Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Edit Journal** action.
3. Select the relevant batch in the **Batch Name** field.
4. Fill in the **Posting Date** field.  
5. In the **Document Type** field, select **Payment**.

    The **Document No.** field is filled by the number series assigned to the batch.  
6. Use the **External Document No.** field to store an identifier, such as the customer's check number.

   > [!NOTE]
   > By default, the External Document No. field is hidden. If it is, and you want to use it, you can use personalization to add it. For more information, see [Personalize your workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

7. In the **Account Type** field, select **Customer**.
8. In the **Account No.** field, select the customer.
9. To post the application at the same time as you post the journal, fill in the following fields:
   1. In the **Bal. Account Type** field, select **G/L Account** for cash payments, and **Bank Account** for other payments.
   2. In the **Bal. Account No.** field, select the cash account for cash payments, or the relevant bank account for other payments.
10. Post the journal.

## To apply a payment to a single customer ledger entry

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Receipt Journal**, and choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Edit Journal** action.
3. On the first journal line, enter the relevant information about the entry to be applied.
4. In the **Document Type** field, enter **Payment**.
5. In the **Account Type** field, enter **Customer**.

7. In the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field, choose the field to open the **Apply Customer Entries** page.
8. On the **Apply Customer Entries** page, select the entry to apply the payment to.
9. In the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount you want to apply to the entry. If you don't enter an amount, the maximum amount is applied.

    At the bottom of the **Apply Customer Entries** page, you can see the specific amount in the **Applied Amount** field and also whether the application balances.  
10. Choose the **OK** button. The **Cash Receipt Journal** page now shows the entry in the **Applies-to Doc. Type** and **Applies-to Doc. No.** fields.
11. Post the cash receipt journal.

## To apply a payment to multiple customer ledger entries

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Receipt Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Edit Journal** action.
3. On the first journal line, enter the relevant information about the entry to be applied.
4. In the **Document Type** field, enter **Payment**.
5. In the **Account Type** field, enter **Customer**.
6. In the **Bal. Account Type** field, enter **Bank Account**.
7. In the **Amount** field, enter the full payment as a negative amount.
8. To apply the payment to multiple customer ledger entries when posting, choose the **Apply Entries** action.  
9. Select the lines with the entries that you want the applying entry to be applied to, and then choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action.

3. To apply the credit memo to a single customer ledger entry when posting, in the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field, select the entry to which you want to apply the payment.
4. On the line in the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount you want to apply to the entry.  

    If you don't enter an amount, application automatically applies the maximum amount. At the bottom of the **Apply Customer Entries** page, you can see the specific amount in the **Applied Amount** field and also whether the application balances.  
5. Choose the **OK** button. The **Sales Credit Memo** page now shows the entry you selected in the **Applies-to Doc. Type** and **Applies-to Doc. No.** fields. And the amount of the credit memo to be posted, adjusted for any possible payment discounts.
6. Post the credit memo.

## To apply a credit memo to multiple customer ledger entries

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant sales credit memo.
3. To apply the credit memo to multiple customer ledger entries when posting, choose the **Apply Entries** action.
4. Select the lines with the entries that you want the applying entry to be applied to, and then choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action.
5. On each line, in the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount you want to apply to the individual entry. If you don't enter an amount, the maximum amount is applied.  

    At the bottom of the **Apply Customer Entries** page, you can see the specific amount in the **Applied Amount** field and also whether the application balances.  
6. Choose the **OK** button. The **Sales Credit Memo** page now shows the amount of the credit memo to be posted, adjusted for any possible payment discounts.
7. Post the credit memo.

## To apply posted customer ledger entries

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the customer card for the customer with entries that you want to apply.
3. Choose the **Ledger Entries** action from the **Related** tab, and then select the line with the entry that is the applying entry.
4. Choose the **Apply Entries** action. The **Apply Customer Entries** page opens showing the open entries for the customer.
5. Select the lines with the entries that you want the applying entry to be applied to, and then choose the **Set Applies-to ID.** action.
6. For each line in the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount you want to apply to the individual entry. If you don't enter an amount, the maximum amount is applied.  

    At the bottom of the **Apply Customer Entries** page, you can see the specific amount in the **Applied Amount** field.  
7. Choose the **Post Application** action. The **Post Application** page appears with the document number of the applying entry and the posting date of the entry with the most recent posting date.  
8. Choose the **OK** button to post the application.

    If the posted application resulted in closed customer ledger entries, the **Open** field is cleared for these ledger entries.  
9. To see the ledger entries, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link. Browse to the card for the relevant customer to see the ledger entries.  

On the ledger entry list, on the line that contains the ledger entry that was fully applied to, you can see that the **Open** check box isn't selected.  

> [!NOTE]  
> After you select an entry on the **Apply Customer Entries** page, or several entries by setting the **Applies-to ID**, the **Applied Amount** field on the journal line will contain the sum of the remaining amounts for the posted entries you've selected, unless the field contains something already. If you select **Apply to Oldest** in the **Application Method** field on the customer card, the application occurs automatically.

## To apply customer ledger entries in different currencies to one another

If you sell to a customer in one currency and receive payment in another currency, you can still apply the invoice to the payment.  

Here's an example. You apply Entry A in one currency to Entry B in another currency. The posting date on Entry A is used to find the exchange rate to use to convert amounts on Entry B. The exchange rate is found on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.  

Applying customer ledger entries in different currencies must be enabled. For more information, see [Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies](finance-how-enable-application-ledger-entries-different-currencies.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Receipts Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the journal you want, and fill in the first empty journal line using a currency code.
3. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
4. Select the line with the entry you want to apply to the entry in the cash receipt journal, choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action, and then select the entry you want to apply to.
5. Choose the **OK** button to return to the cash receipt journal.
6. Post the sales journal.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   When you apply entries in different currencies, the entries are converted to USD. Although the exchange rates for the two currencies are fixed, for example between USD and EUR, there may be a small residual amount when they are converted to USD. These small residual amounts are posted as gains and losses to the account specified in the **Realized Gains Account** or **Realized Losses Account** fields on the **Currencies** page. The **Amount (USD)** field is also adjusted on the vendor ledger entries.  

## To correct an application of customer entries
When you correct an application, correcting entries are created and posted for all entries. The correcting entries are the same as the originals but have an opposite sign in the **Amount** field. The correcting entries include all general ledger entries derived from the application. For example, the payment discount and currency gains/losses. The entries that the application closed are reopened.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant customer card.
3. Choose the **Ledger Entries** action.
4. Select the relevant ledger entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
5. Alternatively, choose the **Detailed Ledger Entry** action.
6. Select the application entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
7. Fill in the fields in the header, and then choose the **Unapply** action.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   If an entry has been applied by more than one application entry, you must unapply the latest application entry first.

# Publish a web service

Web services are a lightweight way to make application functionality available to different kinds of external systems and users. By default, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] exposes several objects as web services for better integration with other Microsoft services. You can add other web services as your business requires.  

Set up a web service in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and then publish the web service so that it's available to authenticated users. All authorized users can access metadata for web services, but only users who have sufficient permissions can access actual data.  

## Creating and Publishing a Web Service

The following steps explain how to create and publish a web service.  

### To create and publish a web service  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Web Services**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Web Services** page, choose **New**. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > **Codeunit** and **Page** are valid types for SOAP web services. **Page** and **Query** are valid types for OData web services. Starting with version 16.3, **Codeunit** is also a valid type for OData v4 web services, but then no URL is shown in the user interface. 
    > Also, if the database contains multiple companies, you can choose an object ID that is specific to one of the companies.  
    > Finally, the service name is visible to consumers of your web service and is the basis for identifying and distinguishing web services, so you should make the name meaningful.

3. Select the check box in the **Published** column.  

When you publish the web service, the **OData URL** and **SOAP URL** fields show the new URLs. However, for codeunits that are exposed as OData v4 unbound actions, the URL fields aren't shown.  

You can test the web service immediately by choosing the links in the **OData URL** and **SOAP URL** fields. Optionally, copy the value of the field and save it for later use. To test codeunits that are exposed as OData v4 unbound actions, follow the instructions in the [Verifying web service availability](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-creating-and-interacting-with-odatav4-unbound-action#verifying-web-service-availability) section in the developer content.

> [!NOTE]
> If the objects that you expose as web services must not be accessible from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you must mark the methods exposed in the code as `[Scope('OnPrem')]`. For more information, see [Scope Attribute](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods/devenv-scope-attribute).

After you publish a web service, it's available to external parties. You can verify the availability of that web service by using a browser, or choose the link in the **OData URL** and **SOAP URL** fields on the **Web Services** page. The following procedure illustrates how you can verify the availability of the web service for later use.  

### To verify the availability of a web service  

1. In your browser, enter the relevant URL. The following table illustrates the types of URLs that you can enter for different web service types.  

    > [!div class="mx-tdBreakAll"]
    > |Type|Syntax|Example|
    > |----------------|------|-------|
    > |SOAP|`https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/*version*/*tenant*/Production/WS/*CompanyName*/*entity*/` |`https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/7acc9d3d-d354-4616-8bbd-c4fc9f2b15b3/Production/WS/CRONUS%20USA%2C%20Inc./Page/InvoiceDocument`|
    > |OData V4|`https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/*version*/*tenant*/Production/ODataV4/Company('*CompanyName*')/*entity*`|`https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/7acc9d3d-d354-4616-8bbd-c4fc9f2b15b3/Production/ODataV4/Company('CRONUS%20USA%2C%20Inc.')/InvoiceDocument`<br/>    The company name is case-sensitive.|

2. Review the information that is displayed in the browser. Verify that you can see the name of the web service that you created.  

When you access a web service, and you want to write data back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify the company name. You can specify the company as part of the URI as shown in the examples; alternatively, specify the company as part of the query parameters. For example, the following URIs point to the same OData web service and are both valid URIs.  

```
https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v1.0/OData/Company('CRONUS International Ltd.')/Customer  
```

```
https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v1.0/OData/Customer?company='CRONUS International Ltd.'  
```

# Design Details: Item Tracking
As the flow of goods in today's supply chain becomes more and more complex, the ability to keep track of items is increasingly important to the companies involved. Monitoring an item's transaction flow is a legal requirement in the business of medical and chemical supply, but other businesses may want to monitor products with warranties or expiration dates for customer service reasons.  

An item tracking system should provide a company with easy handling of serial and lot numbers, considering each unique piece of merchandise: when and where received, where stored, when and where sold. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has gradually expanded its coverage of this business requirement and today provides application-wide functionality and a solid core on which to develop extensions.

# Make check payments

You can issue electronic and manual checks in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Both methods use the payment journal to issue checks to vendors. You can also void checks and view check ledger entries.

The following procedure shows how to pay a vendor with a computer checks by:

- Applying the payment to the relevant vendor invoice.
- Printing the check.
- Posting the payment as paid.

These steps result in positive vendor ledger entries that are applied to negative bank ledger entries, and physical checks for processing in the bank.

You can pay with two types of checks. For both types, the **Bal. Account Type** or the **Account Type** field must contain **Bank Account**.

- **Computer Check**: Select this option if you want to print a check for the amount on the payment journal line. You must print the checks before you can post the journal lines.
- **Manual Check**: Select this option if you have created a check manually and want to create a corresponding check ledger entry for this amount. By using this option, you can't print the check.

> [!NOTE]  
> To make sure that your bank only clears validated checks and amounts, you can send them a file that contains vendor, check, and payment information. To learn more, go to [Export a Positive Pay file](finance-how-positive-pay.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your printer must be correctly set up with the check forms, and you must define which check layout to use. To learn more, go to [Select a Check Layout](finance-how-define-check-layouts.md). Alternatively, you can send the check as a PDF file, for example.  

You can print up to 10 invoices on a page for a check stub. If a check applies to more than 10 invoices, when you print the stub we void the check on the first page and print the word VOID on the check. We then print the remainder of the invoices and the total check amount on the second page.

## To pay a vendor invoice with a check

The following describes how to pay a vendor by check. The steps are similar to refund a customer by check.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the payment journal lines. To learn more, go to [Record Payments and Refunds](payables-how-post-payments-refunds.md).
3. In the **Payment Method Code** field, select **Check**.
4. Choose the **Print Check** action.
5. On the **Check** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. If your printer is set up to print checks, choose the **Print** button. Otherwise, choose the **Send to** button, select the **PDF Document** option, choose the **OK** button, and then print the PDF document.

    You can now send the physical checks to the vendors.
7. Choose the **Post** action.

    The payment is applied to the vendor and paid. Fully applied vendor ledger entries and bank ledger entries are created.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want to print and pay checks in more than one currency from different bank accounts, you must run the **Print Check** batch job separately for each currency and specify the appropriate bank account.

## To cancel printed checks that aren't posted

You can cancel non-posted checks after they have been printed by using the **Void Check** action on the **Payment Journal** page.

1. On the **Payment Journal** page, choose the **Void Check**, and then choose which checks to cancel.

## To void checks

After you post a check payment, you can only cancel (void) a check from the resulting bank ledger entries.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the check is applied to an invoice, unapply the payment first so that the invoice can be repaid. To learn more, go to [To unapply an application of vendor entries](payables-how-apply-purchase-transactions-manually.md#to-unapply-an-application-of-vendor-entries). The steps are the same for customers. After you unapply the payment, void the check. If the check was printed but didn't pay an invoice, then choose **Void Check Only** as described in this section.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant bank account, and then choose the **Check Ledger Entries** action.
3. On the **Check Ledger Entries** page, choose the **Void Check** action.
4. Select the **Void Check Only** checkbox.
5. Choose the **OK** button.

## To view a summary of posted checks

If you want to review posted checks, for example to verify multiple checks paid to one vendor, you can use the **Bank Account - Check Details** report.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Account - Check Details**, and then choose the related link.
2. Set filters as relevant, and then choose the **Preview** button.

# Analyze data in lists with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how to use *analysis assist* to help you analyze data on list pages.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## About analysis assist

Analysis assist is a Copilot for the [analysis mode](analysis-mode.md) on list pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Analysis mode provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. To analyze data in analysis mode, you create an *analysis* tab where you transform the data to display the desired aggregations and summarizations. For example, you arrange fields in rows and columns, specify filters, sort columns, and pivot on fields. With analysis assist, instead of doing this task manually, you achieve much of the same&mdash;or least as a start&mdash;by using words. By expressing the structure you want in natural language, like "sort on quantity from smallest to largest" or "show average cost per category," analysis assist uses AI to generate a suggested layout on an analysis tab.

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-language-support.md)]

## Prerequisites

- An administrator must activate the **Analyze list** capability on the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page and grand users permissions to use analysis mode. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).  

## Get started

1. Open the list page you want to analyze.

   For example, to work with the **Items** page, select the ![Magnifying glass that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png) icon (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>), enter *items*, and then choose the related link.

1. You can start analyzing data with Copilot directly from the list page or by first entering analysis mode. To get started, do one of the following steps:

    - In the action bar at the top of the page, select ![Shows the copilot icon](media/copilot-icon.png) **Copilot** > **Analyze list**.
    - In the action bar at the top of the page, select ![Shows the enter analysis mode icon](media/analysis-mode-icon.png) **Enter analysis mode**, then select ![Shows the copilot icon](media/copilot-icon.png) **Copilot** > **Create new analysis**.

1. In the **Analyze Items** window, enter a description of the layout you want. This description is known as a *prompt*.

    ![Shows the analysis assist Copilot](media/analysis-assist.svg)

    > [!TIP]
    > For help in writing a prompt, select ![Shows the view prompt icon](media/prompt-guide-icon.png) **Prompt guide**, and choose one of the options to get you started. The text in brackets `[ ]` is shown only as an example and isn't included in the Copilot window.

1. Select **Generate** and then wait while Copilot generates the layout on new analysis tab.
1. Review the results on the new analysis tab.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you navigate away from the new analysis tab (such as going to another analysis tab or page), the new analysis tab is automatically saved and Copilot closes.

1. If you want to change the generated analysis, you can do one of these steps:

   - To build on the previous instructions, enter the information in the **Add more details about the analysis** box, then select the ![Show the adjust arrow](media/analysis-assist-adjust-button.png) **Adjust** arrow. Copilot remembers your previous instructions and uses them to make adjustments.

     ![Shows the analysis assist history buttons](media/analysis-assist-paging.svg)

   - To manually adjust the layout, you can interact directly with the columns, data area, and analysis filters. For example, you can adjust a filter and remove a column, and Copilot remains available in case you want assistance with building on your manual adjustments and previous instructions.
   - To start from scratch by adding new instructions, select the ![Shows the edit prompt pencil icon](media/edit-pencil.png) **Edit prompt:**, add the details to the prompt, and then select **Generate**.

1. Use **< Back** and **> Next** at the top of the Copilot window to review the different layouts you created as you made adjustments for this analysis tab. You can go back to any adjustments that you or Copilot made to the tab since you created it.

1. If you want to save the analysis tab, select **Keep it**. If you don't want to save it, select **Discard**.

## Prompt tips and examples

Creating effective prompts for Copilot is essential to get accurate and relevant analysis suggestions. There are also ways to minimize text you add in prompts to make it faster when typing. Here are some tips and guidelines followed by some examples:

- Be concise and avoid long sentences or multiple sentences.
- Make sure field names used in prompts are somewhat close to actual field names on the page.
- Use natural language, expressing the data structure you want in a friendly and conversational manner.
- Use common keywords, phrases, and terms used in data analysis, like `group by`, `sum`, `sort by`, and so on.
- If the initial response isn't what you want, add follow-up instructions or rephrase the last instruction.
- Common abbreviations are acceptable.
- Letter case isn't important.

### Examples

These following prompt examples use analysis assist on the **Items** list. The items page includes three summable fields for analysis: **Quantity on Hand**, **Unit Cost**, **Unit Price**.

Prompt: `Show low-stock items by category`

This prompt can be used to group item records by their assigned category, filtering items to only those items with low stock. Copilot suggests a definition for low inventory and applies a filter such as "Quantity on Hand less than 10". In this case, the items list doesn't display the **Category** field, Instead, Copilot brings that field into the analysis tab so that you don´t need to go through the manual effort of personalizing the page.

Prompt: `Show items by brand and unit of measure`

This prompt tries to show totals for all summable fields, grouped by brand and the **Base Unit of Measure** field. But in this case, "brand" doesn't match any field name, so Copilot probably can't find a matching field. It then asks you to rephrase the prompt and try again.

Prompt: `Show items by type and uom`

This prompt  shows totals for all summable fields, grouped by the **Type** field and **Base Unit of Measure** field. In this prompt, the abbreviation `uom` is used instead of writing out "unit of measure". Copilot is often able to interpret abbreviations or alternate names and match them to fields on the list.

Prompt: `Show total quantity per type per UoM`

This prompt creates a pivot table on the **Quantity on Hand** field per **Base Unit of Measure** per **Type**.

## How Copilot works with fields for analysis assist

Copilot can use any of the visible or hidden fields on the list page and add them as columns to the analysis tab layout. Hidden fields are those fields that you would typically add to the list by personalizing the page.

When Copilot determines that a hidden field is useful for your analysis tab, the field is shown as a column in the tab layout. It's also shown in the **Columns** pane so that you can hide or reorder it, or add it to any other analysis tabs for this list.  

> [!NOTE]
> If an administrator has turned off personalization for your profile (role), Copilot isn't able to use hidden fields from the list.

Copilot can't reach fields that are on the table but not on the page, and it can't use fields from other pages.

# Set Up Customer Price Groups
  
Sales prices can be made dependent on the customer groups to which you sell. These are called customer price groups.

Before you set up customer price groups, you must decide how many groups you want and which customers will belong to each group.  

## How to create sales prices for a group of customers  

When you have agreed on the prices that the group of customers will pay for certain items, you register the agreement for the individual items on the lines in the **Sales Prices** page.

### To create sales prices for a group of customers

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer Price Groups**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Select the line for the customer price group. If a line does not already exist you can create a new line. Select **New** to create a new entity and give it a name.  
    
    For the selected line, verify the contents of the fields **Allow Line Disc.**, **Allow Invoice Disc.**, **Price Includes Tax** and **Tax Bus. Posting Gr. (Price)**. 
  
3. Select the **Navigate** action, and choose **Sales Prices**. The **Sales Prices** page opens. The **Sales Type** field will be filled in with **Customer Price Group**.  
  
4. Fill in the **Sales Code** with the sales code you selected on the previous page.  
  
5. Fill in the fields on the lines with the **Item No.**, **Unit of Measure Code**, and the agreed **Unit Price**. You can also show the **Variant Code** column and specify the **Variant Code** if there are several variants of the item.  
  
6. If the customer group needs to purchase a minimum quantity in order to gain the price agreed on, fill in the **Minimum Quantity** field.  

7. If required, enter the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** of the price agreement.  
  
8. If relevant, you can also specify the **Currency Code**.

Repeat steps 4 through 8 for each item that you want to create a Sales Price for.

## How to enter customer price group codes on customer cards  

After you have set up the customer price groups, you can enter the customer price group codes on the customer cards.

### To enter customer price group codes on a customer card  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Open the relevant **Customer Card** for a customer that you want to be part of a customer price group.  

3. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, in the **Customer Price Group** field, select the **Customer Price Group** code.

# Schedule jobs to adjust and reconcile inventory cost

Schedule Jobs for automatic cost adjustment with the general ledger, posting to the general ledger are turned on by default.
However, as data accumulates over time that might impact performance. To reduce the load on the application, it's often helpful to use job queue entries to move tasks to run in the background.

## Move the task of adjusting item costs to the background with the help of assisted setup

Creating the job queue entries can be tricky, even for an experienced consultant, so we have an assisted setup guide to make the process easier for adjusting item costs.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Inventory Setup** page, toggle the **Automatic Cost Posting** field, or specify **Never** in the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field.  
3. In the notification that now displays at the top of the page, choose the **Schedule Job Queue Entry** link. This opens the **Schedule Cost Adjustment and Posting** assisted setup guide.  
4. Specify the task that you want to schedule.  

  > [!NOTE]
  > You cannot create a new job queue entry if a job queue entry for the specified task already exists.

5. Select the **View job queue entries when finished** field to review and adjust settings. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

## To create a job queue entry for adjusting and reconciling inventory cost manually

Alternatively, you can create job queue entries manually. The following procedure shows how to set the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job to automatically run daily, but the same steps apply to the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Object Type to Run** field, choose *Report*.  
4. In the **Object ID to Run** field, choose *795*, **Adjust Cost - Item Entries**.  
5. In the **Next Run Date Formula** field, enter *1D*.
6. In the **Starting Time** field, enter *2 AM*.
7. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action.

Now, inventory cost will be updated every night.  

To schedule a task for reconciling inventory with the general ledger, choose Codeunit 2846 **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**.

> [!TIP]
> To avoid locking, do not schedule tasks for the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** codeunit, and tasks for posting sales or purchasing transactions at the same time. Also, make sure that they use same job queue category.

# Set up unrealized VAT for cash-based accounting

If you're using cash-based accounting methods, you can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to handle unrealized VAT.

## To use general ledger accounts for unrealized VAT

You can choose to have VAT amounts calculated and posted to a temporary general ledger account when an invoice is posted, and then posted to the correct general ledger account and included in VAT statements when the actual payment of the invoice is posted. Before you can do this, you must complete the [VAT posting setup](finance-setup-vat.md).

To use accounts for unrealized VAT, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, and enter **General Ledger Setup**.
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, select the **Unrealized VAT** check box.
3. Choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), and enter **VAT Posting Setup**.
4. On the **VAT Posting Setup** page, choose the VAT posting group, and then choose the **Edit** action.
5. In the **Unrealized VAT Type** field, choose an option to specify how to allocate payments to the invoice amount (excluding VAT) and the VAT amount itself, and how to transfer VAT amounts from the unrealized VAT account to the realized account. The following table describes the options.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Blank | Choose this option if you don't want to use the unrealized VAT feature. |
| Percentage | Payments cover both VAT and the invoice amount in proportion to the payment's percentage of the remaining invoice amount. The paid VAT amount is transferred from the unrealized VAT account to the realized VAT account. |
| First | Payments cover VAT first and then invoice amounts. In this case, the amount transferred from the unrealized VAT account to the VAT account will equal the amount of the payment until the total VAT has been paid. |
| Last | Payments cover the invoice amount first and then VAT. In this case, no amount will be transferred from the unrealized VAT account to the VAT account until the total amount of the invoice, excluding VAT, has been paid. |
| First (Fully Paid) | Payments will cover VAT first (like the _First_ option), but no amount will be transferred to the VAT account until the full amount of VAT has been paid. |
| Last (Fully Paid) | Payments will cover invoice amount first (like the _Last_ option), but no amount will be transferred to the VAT account until the full amount of VAT has been paid. |

6. In the **Sales VAT Unreal. Account** field, choose the account for unrealized sales VAT.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The VAT amount will be posted to this account, and stay there until the customer payment is posted. The amount is then transferred to the account for sales VAT.
7. In the **Purch. VAT Unreal. Account** field, enter the general ledger account for unrealized purchase VAT.

> [!NOTE]  
> The VAT amount will be posted to this account, and stay there until the customer payment is posted. The amount is then transferred to the account for purchase VAT.

# Design Details: Item Tracking Lines Page
Item tracking records and reservation records are created in the reservation system, and their availability is calculated dynamically. Data that is entered on the **Item Tracking Lines** page is managed in a temporary version of the **Tracking Specification** table. When the page is closed, the active data is committed to the **Reservation Entry** table and the historic data is committed to the **Tracking Specification** table. For more information, see [Design Details: Active versus Historic Item Tracking Entries](design-details-active-versus-historic-item-tracking-entries.md).  
  
Lookups from the **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields show availability based on both the **Item Ledger Entry** table and the **Reservation Entry** table, with no date filter. The matrix of quantity fields on the header of the **Item Tracking Lines** page dynamically displays the quantities and sums of item tracking numbers that are being entered on the lines of the page. The quantities must correspond to those of the document line, which is indicated by **0** in the **Undefined** fields in the header of the page.  
  
To coordinate the flow of serial and lot numbers through inventory, the following rules exist for entering data on the **Item Tracking Lines** page:  
  
* For both inbound and outbound item tracking lines, you cannot enter a serial number, with or without a lot number, more than once in the same instance of the **Item Tracking Lines** page. If you try to enter any combination of serial or lot numbers that is already present on the page, then an error message blocks the data entry.  
* For inbound item tracking lines, you cannot post the related document if an item of the same variant and with the same serial number is already in inventory. If you try to post a positive line for an inventory item with the same variant and serial number, then an error message blocks the posting. However, for both inbound and outbound item tracking lines on open documents, you can have the same combination of serial or lot numbers that relate to different source document lines, that is, existing in different instances of the **Item Tracking Lines** page until the related document is posted.  
* If the item is set up for serial number-specific tracking or lot number- specific tracking, then you cannot post an outbound document line unless an item with the defined serial or lot number exists in inventory. If you try to post an outbound document line for an item with a serial lot number that is not in inventory, then an error message blocks the posting.  
  
The rules for entering data on the **Item Tracking Lines** page also support the coupling principles that govern order tracking, planning, and reservation. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Tracking and Planning](design-details-item-tracking-and-planning.md).

# About production orders

Use production orders to manage the conversion of purchased materials into manufactured items. Production orders route work through various work or machine centers on the shop floor.  

Before they start production, most companies do supply planning, typically once a week, to calculate how many production orders and purchase orders they need fulfill sales demand. Purchase orders supply the required components according to the end item's bill of materials (BOM).

Production orders are central components in manufacturing, and contain the following information:  

- Products planned for manufacturing  
- Materials required for the planned production orders  
- Materials that are already selected  
- Products that were manufactured in the past  
- Materials that were used in previous manufacturing operations  

Production orders are the starting points for:  

- Planning future manufacturing  
- Controlling current manufacturing  
- Tracking of finished manufacturing  

## Production order creation  

You can create production orders on an order-by-order basis manually on the **Production Order** page, or generate them from the **Sales Order Planning** or **Order Planning** pages. You can also create multiple orders from the **Planning Worksheet** page.  

You create production orders using information from:  

- Items  
- Production BOMs
- Routings  
- Machine centers  
- Work centers  

## Reserving and tracking production orders to their source

Production orders are automatically reserved and tracked to their source when you create them from:  

- The [Planning Worksheet](production-how-to-run-mps-and-mrp.md) page.
- The [Sales Order Planning](production-how-to-create-production-orders-from-sales-orders.md) page.
- The [Order Planning](production-how-to-plan-for-new-demand.md) page.  
- The [Replan](production-how-to-replan-refresh-production-orders.md) action on production orders.  

To learn more, go to [Track Relations Between Demand and Supply](production-how-track-demand-supply.md).

If you create production orders by other means, they aren't automatically reserved and tracked.

## Production order status  

A production order can have one of the following statuses:

- Simulated
- Planned
- Firm Planned
- Released
- Finished

The status of a production order controls what you can do with it, and the form and content of the production. Production orders display on different pages according to their status. You can't change the status of a production order manually. To change the status of an order, use the **Change Status** action on the production order or use the **Change Production Order Status** page to change the status of one or orders in one go.

The **Change Status** action is available for the following types of orders:

- Simulated production orders
- Planned production orders
- Firm planned production orders
- Released production orders

> [!TIP]
> A confirmation dialog with additional questions displays for each order individually. If there are multiple orders with partial output or consumption, confirm each one separately.

If the status of orders can't change, they're skipped. The **Error Message** page shows the orders that were skipped and the reasons.  

### Simulated production order  

A simulated production order is unique because of the following characteristics:  

- It's a simulation you can use for quotes and costing. For example, when the Research and Development department wants a cost estimate for a proposed item. A simulated production order serves as an example of a production order.  
- They don't influence the planning of orders. MPS and MRP don't consider and aren't affected by simulated production orders. Also, you can't use a simulated production order as a template because it disappears when you change its status.  

### Planned production order  

A planned production order is unique because of the following characteristics:  

- You can automatically create a planned production order from a sales order.  
- Planned production orders are like released production orders and provide input to planning by showing the total capacity requirements by work center or machine center.  
- A planned production order represents the best estimate of the future load for the work center or machine center load based on available information. Typically, they're generated from planning, but you can also manually create them. However, they're erased the next time you run planning so it isn't practical to create them manually.  
- Their generation in planning results in a suggested "planned order release" that includes the quantity, release date, and due date. The planning system logic is based on the replenishment system, reorder policies, and order modifiers that it encounters in the net requirement planning process.  
- The load for each work center or machine center on the planned production order's routing shows their effect.  

### Firm planned production order  

A firm planned production order is unique because of the following characteristics:  

- You can automatically create a firm planned production order from a sales order.  
- A firm planned production order acts as a placeholder in the planning schedule for a future project released to the floor.  
- You can generate them during planning, create them manually, or create them from sales orders. They aren't erased during subsequent planning.  
- Their generation in planning results in a suggested "planned order release" that includes the quantity, release date, and due date. The planning system logic is based on the replenishment system, reorder policies, and order modifiers that it encounters in the net requirement planning process.  
- The load for each work center or machine center on the firm planned production order's routing show their effect.  

### Released production order  

The released production order is unique, based on the following characteristics:  

- You can automatically create a released production order from a sales order.  
- A released production order doesn't necessarily mean that materials are picked or the project moves to its first operation.  
- People typically create a released production order immediately after they enter the sales order in make-to-order (MTO) environments.  
- You can use a released production order to record the actual material consumption and product output. In addition, automatic flushing of consumption and product output only occur for released production orders.  

### Finished production order  

A finished production order is unique, based on the following characteristics:  

- A finished production order is typically one that is manufactured.  
- Finishing the production order is an important task in completing the costing lifecycle of the produced item. After you finish a production order, you can adjust and reconcile costing.  
- Finished production orders are used for reporting and to support the ability to track back to other orders (for example, sales, production, and purchases). The ability to track back to a finished production order allows you to review the detailed history.  
- You can't change finished production orders.  

#### Reopen a finished production order to make corrections

After you complete a production order and set its status to **Finished**, you might discover a mistake. For example, you might find that consumption is missing or the item tracking information is incorrect. To make sure that your inventory and cost transactions are correct, use the **Reopen** action on the **Finished Production Orders** page to make adjustments. However, to protect your data there are a few restrictions:

- You can only reopen an order one time.
- You can't reopen an order that has no output and cost was written off to an adjustment account.

## Production order execution  

After you create and schedule a production order, you must release it to the shop floor so that work can start. While you work on an order, you record:  

- The materials that were picked or consumed.  
- The time spent working on the order.
- The quantity of the item produced.

You can record this information manually or through automatic reporting. The method depends on the selection in the **Flushing Method** field on the item and work center.  

### Material consumption  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers options for how to record material consumption. For example, you can record material consumption manually, which can be useful if you often substitute components or generate more scrap than you expected.  

Consumption of materials can be processed through the [consumption journal](production-how-to-post-consumption.md), or [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can record it automatically, which is known as automatic reporting (flushing). The **Manual**, **Forward**, and **Backward** reporting methods are available.

Manual consumption reporting uses consumption journals to specify material picking.  

Forward consumption reporting assumes the expected quantity of all materials for the entire order is consumed at the release of a production order, unless you use routing link codes. When you use routing link codes, the material consumed after the start of the operational step is recorded in the output journal. To forward flush the entire production order, you need to do two things:  

- All items in the top-level production BOM need to have forward flushing selected on their respective item card.  
- All routing link codes on the production BOM must be removed.  

Backward consumption reporting records the actual quantity of all material picked or consumed when the status of a production order is changed to *Finished,* unless using routing link codes. When you use routing link codes, the material is consumed after a quantity of the parent item is recorded for the operational step in the output journal.  

When you refresh the production order, the flushing method is copied from the item card. The flushing method for each production order component controls how and when you record consumption. Therefore, it's important to note that you can change flushing method for specific items directly on the production order. To learn more, go to [Flush Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md).

### Production output  

You can track the time spent working on a production order and the quantity produced. This information can help you determine the costs of production. Also, manufacturers who use a standard costing system might want to record actual information in order to help them develop better standards.  

Output can be processed through [output journals](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md), but can also be recorded automatically. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] copies the flushing method from the machine center or work center card to the production order routing when refreshing. As with material consumption, there are **Manual**, **Forward**, and **Backward** reporting methods for output.

The Manual method uses the output journal to specify time consumed and quantity produced.  

The Forward method records the expected output (and time), which is automatically recorded at the release of a production order. Routing link codes aren't a factor in the forward flushing of the output.  

Backward method records the expected output (and time), which is automatically recorded at the finish of a production order. Routing link codes aren't a factor in the back flushing of the output.  

### Posting consumption and output  

You can use any combination of automatic flushing and manually recorded information for both consumption and output. For example, you might want to automatically forward flush components, but still use a consumption journal to record scrap. Similarly, you might want to automatically record output, but use an output journal to record scrap of the parent item or extra time spent on the order.  

Finally, if you enter consumption and output manually, you need to determine the sequence in which you're going to record this information. You can record consumption first and use a shortcut method to enter the information, which is based on expected quantity of output. Or, you can enter output first, using the **Explode Routing** action. You would then record consumption based on actual quantity of output.  

### Production journals  

The [Production Journal](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md) combines the functions of a consumption journal and output journals into one journal, which is accessed directly from the released production order.  

The purpose of a production journal is to provide a single interface for you to register consumption and output from a production order.  

Production journals have a simple view and provide you with the ability to:  

- Easily record output and consumption related to a production order  
- Relate the components to operations  
- Relate actual operation data with the standard estimates on a production order routing and component lines  
- Post and print an overview of registered operation data for a production order  

Production journals do many of the same things as consumption and output journals. Dimensions, item tracking, and bin contents are handled in the same way.  

However, production journals differ from the consumption and output journals in the following ways:  

- You open them directly from a released production order line and they're preset with the relevant data.
- They let you define which types of components to handle based on a flushing method filter on the journal.  
- Quantities and times already posted for the order display at the bottom of the journal as actual entries.  
- Fields where data entry is irrelevant are blank and noneditable.  
- You can specify how output quantities are preset in the journal. For example, that the last operation must have zero as the output quantity.  
- A confirmation message displays if you exit a journal without posting your changes.  
- They display operations and components together in a structure that provides an overview of the production process.  

In the production journal, consumption quantities are posted as negative item ledger entries, output quantities are posted as positive ledger entries, and times spent are posted as capacity ledger entries.

# Purchases Overview (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Purchases Overview** report gives a clear picture of your purchasing activities. It highlights important metrics such as

- Total purchase amounts
- Outstanding liabilities
- Invoiced purchases

The report breaks down purchase quantities by location and item category, and provides vendor information to help with financial analysis, budget management, and compliance.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases Overview Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-overview.png":::

## Use the report

The report helps leadership and management teams track actual spending on purchasing activities, manage budgets, and evaluate vendor performance.

CEOs can use the report to keep track of purchasing activities. This report gives a clear picture of your total purchase amount, outstanding liabilities, and invoiced purchases. By analyzing purchase quantities by location and item category, and reviewing vendor information, you can gain valuable insights into your financial performance. With this information, you can make informed decisions about budget management and vendor relationships.

Purchasing managers can identify where you might be overspending or underspending. For example, you might notice that your organization spent a lot on a specific item category, but the quantity of purchases was lower than expected. You might review vendor contracts, find alternative vendors with better prices, or negotiate better terms with existing vendors. By taking these actions, you can optimize purchasing activities, reduce costs, and comply with the overall budget.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Purchases Overview* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)
- [**Outstanding Amount (excluding VAT)**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#outstanding-amount-excl-vat)
- [**Amount Received but Not Invoiced (excluding VAT)**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#amt-rcd-not-invd-excl-vat)
- [**Invoiced Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#invoiced-amount)
- [**Purchase Quantity**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-quantity)

# About inventory costing
Managing inventory costs is concerned with recording and reporting business operating costs. It includes the reporting of manufacturing costs and inventory costs, that is, the value of items.  

 Central principles to understand are that costing methods define how items are valued when they leave inventory, that cost adjustment updates the cost of goods sold with related purchase costs posted after the sale, and that inventory values must be posted to dedicated G/L accounts at regular intervals.  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Count, adjust, and reclassify inventory using journals

To ensure that your quantities are correct, physically count all of the items in your inventory. Some businesses do an annual physical count, and others count all or only some items more often. After you count items, use journals to post the actual quantities to the general ledger. For example, when you valuate inventory at the end of a period.

To count some items more often than others, perhaps because of their value, use cycle counts. For cycle counts, assign special counting periods to the items. Learn more at [To do cycle counting](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-do-cycle-counting).

To adjust quantities after a physical count or other purposes, use an item journal to change the inventory ledger entries without posting transactions. You can also adjust the quantity for a single item on an item card.

To change attributes on item ledger entries, use an item reclassification journal. Typical attributes to reclassify include dimensions and sales campaign codes. You can also use reclassification journals for transfers by reclassifying bin and location codes. Special steps apply when you want to reclassify serial or lot numbers and their expiration dates. For more information, see [Work with Serial and Lot Numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md).

> [!NOTE]
> In multi-step processes, items are registered in bins as warehouse entries, not as item ledger entries. Therefore, you do counting, adjusting, and reclassifying in warehouse journals that support bins. Then you synchronize the new or changed warehouse entries with their related item ledger entries to reflect the changes in inventory quantities and values.

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel](includes/edit-in-excel.md)]

## To count physical inventory

To check whether the quantity registered is the same as the physical quantity in stock, count your physical inventory. That is, count the actual items on hand. Typically, counts happen at the end of a fiscal year, but some businesses count items more often. If there are differences, post the actual quantities to the item accounts before you do inventory valuation.

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure describes how to do a physical inventory using a journal on the **Phys. Inventory Journal** page. You can use documents on the **Physical Inventory Order** and **Physical Inventory Recording** pages. These documents offer more control and support for distributing the counting work to multiple employees. Learn more at [Count Inventory Using Documents](inventory-how-count-inventory-with-documents.md).<br /><br />
> Note that you can't use the document-based functionality to count items in bins or warehouse entries.

The counting process also involves the following tasks:

- Calculate the expected inventory.
- Print the report you want to use for the count.
- Enter and post the actual quantities.

Depending on your warehouse setup, count physical inventory in one of the following ways. For more information, see [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

- If your location doesn't use directed put-away and pick, use the **Phys. Inventory Journal** page. The procedure is similar to physical inventory without cycle counting.  
- If your location uses directed put-away and picks, use the **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal** page. Then use the **Item Journals** page to run the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** action. <!--We should say what to do on each of these pages.-->

### To calculate expected inventory in basic warehouse configurations

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Calculate Inventory** action from **Prepare**.
3. On the **Calculate Inventory** page, specify the conditions to use to create the journal lines, such as whether to include items that have zero recorded inventory.
4. Set filters if you only want to calculate inventory for certain items, bins, locations, or dimensions.
5. Choose the **OK** button.

> [!NOTE]  
> Item entries are processed according to the information that you specified, and lines are created in the physical inventory journal. Notice that the **Qty. (Phys. Inventory)** field has the same quantity as the **Qty. (Calculated)** field. You don't need to enter the counted quantity for items where these values match. However, if the quantity counted differs, enter the quantity that was counted.

### To print the report to be used when counting

1. On the **Physical Inventory Journals** page containing the calculated expected inventory, Choose the **Print** action from **Home**.
2. On the **Physical Inventory List** page, specify whether the report will show the calculated quantity and inventory items by serial and lot numbers.
3. Set filters if you only want to print the report for certain items, bins, locations, or dimensions.
4. Choose **Print**.

Warehouse employees can now count inventory and record any differences on the printed report.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take several days before printed reports come back for final processing and posting. When you specify and post actual counted inventory, the system adjusts inventory to reflect the difference between the expected and the actual counted inventory. You must keep the originally calculated journal lines and not recalculate the expected inventory, because the expected inventory may change and lead to incorrect inventory levels. If you need to issue multiple reports, such as for different locations or group of items, you must create and keep separate journal batches.

### To enter and post the actual counted inventory in basic warehouse configurations

1. On each line on the **Physical Inventory Journals** page where the actual inventory on hand, as determined by the physical count, differs from the calculated quantity, enter the actual inventory on hand in the **Qty. (Phys. Inventory)** field.
  
  > [!NOTE]  
  > If the physical count reveals differences caused by items posted with incorrect locations, don't enter the differences in the physical inventory journal. Instead, use a reclassification journal or a transfer order to redirect the items to the correct locations. 

2. To adjust the calculated quantities to the actual counted quantities, choose the **Post** action from **Home**.

    Posting creates item ledger entries and physical inventory ledger entries. Open the Item Card page for the item to find its physical inventory ledger entries.

3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
4. To verify the count, open the **Item Card** page for the item, and choose the **Phys. Inventory Ledger Entries** action from **Item**
1. .

### To calculate the expected inventory in advanced warehouse configurations

Synchronize item ledger and warehouse <!--warehouse what?--> before you count physical inventory. Otherwise, what you post to the physical inventory journal and item ledger is the physical inventory results combined with other warehouse adjustments for the items. Learn more at [Synchronize quantities in the item ledger and warehouse](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-synchronize-the-adjusted-warehouse-entries-with-the-related-item-ledger-entries).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Calculate Inventory** action to open the **Whse. Calculate Inventory** page.  
3. Set the filters to specify the items to count in the journal, and then choose **OK**.

   [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a line for each bin that meets the filter requirements. You can delete lines, but if you want to post the results as a physical inventory, count the item in all the bins that contain it.  

   If you only count an item in some bins but not others, you can enter differences and post them in the **Item Journal** page later by using the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** action.  

### To enter and post the actual counted inventory in advanced warehouse configurations

1. On the **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal** page, enter the actual quantities in the **Qty. (Phys. Inventory)** field.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **Qty. (Calculated)** field is filled in based on bin records. This quantity is copied to the **Qty. (Physical)** field on each line. If the quantities in these fields don't match, enter the actual quantity.  

2. After you enter all actual quantities, choose the **Register** action.  

    When you register the journal, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates two warehouse entries in the warehouse register for every line that was counted and registered:  

    - If the calculated and the actual quantities differ, a negative or positive quantity is registered for the bin, and a balancing quantity is posted to the location's adjustment bin.  
    - If the calculated quantity equals the physical quantity, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] registers **0** for both the bin and the adjustment bin. 

When you register physical inventory, you don't post to the item, physical inventory, or the value ledgers. However, the records are available for reconciliation when needed. To keep quantities accurate, after you count items in all bins, post the results.<!--physical inventory journal--> Learn more at [Synchronize quantities in the item ledger and warehouse](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-synchronize-the-adjusted-warehouse-entries-with-the-related-item-ledger-entries).

## To do cycle counting

You can count items as often as you'd like. For example, because they're more valuable or top sellers. Specify the counting frequency by assigning special counting periods to the items.

Depending on your warehouse setup, you can do cycle counting in the following ways. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

- If your location doesn't use directed put-away and picks, use the **Physical Inventory Journal** page. The steps are similar to counting physical inventory without cycle counting.  
- If your location uses directed put-away and picks, use the **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal** page. Then use the **Item Journals** page to run the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** action. <!--we should say what to do on each of these pages-->  

### To set up counting periods

Counting physical inventory is typically a recurring task, for example monthly, quarterly, or annually. You can set up the inventory counting periods you need and assign one to each item. Afterward, use the **Calculate Counting Period** action on the **Physical Inventory Journal** page to automatically create lines for the items.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Counting Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### To assign a counting period to an item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the item to which you want to assign a counting period.  
3. In the **Phys Invt Counting Period Code** field, select the counting period.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you're changing the counting period, a message displays information about the results of the change. Choose **Yes** to change the code and calculate the first counting period for the item. The next time you choose to calculate a counting period in the physical inventory journal, the item appears as a line on the **Phys. Invt. Item Selection** page. You can then count the item periodically.

### To start a count based on counting periods in basic warehouse configurations

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Calculate Counting Period** action.

    The **Phys. Invt. Item Selection** page shows items that need to be counted according to their counting periods.
3. Count the physical inventory. Learn more at [To count physical inventory](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-count-physical-inventory).

### To start a count based on counting periods in advanced warehouse configurations

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Calculate Counting Period** action.

    The **Phys. Invt. Item Selection** page show items need to be counted according to their counting periods.
3. Count the physical inventory. Learn more at [To count physical inventory](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-count-physical-inventory).  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > Count the item in all bins that contain it. If you delete bin lines that were retrieved for counting on the **Whse. Phys. Inventory** page, the count will be incorrect when you post it in a physical inventory journal.  

## To adjust the quantity of one item

After you do a physical count of an item, use the **Adjust Inventory** action to record the actual inventory quantity.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the item for which you want to adjust inventory, and then choose the **Adjust Inventory** action.
3. In the **New Inventory** field for the location, enter the result of the count.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

<!-- I don't see a "Quantity on Hand" field on the Item Card page. Should this point to the options for viewing availability?

The item’s inventory is adjusted. The new quantity is shown in the **Quantity on Hand** field on the **Item Card** page.-->

You can also use the **Adjust Inventory** action as an easy way to add purchased items to inventory if you don't use purchase invoices or orders to record your purchases. Learn more at [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> After you adjust inventory, update its current value. For more information, see [Revalue Inventory](inventory-how-revalue-inventory.md).

### To adjust the quantities of multiple items in basic warehouse configurations

On the **Item Journals** page, you can post item transactions directly to adjust inventory for purchases, sales, and positive or negative changes without using documents.

If you often use the item journal to post the same or similar journal lines, for example, for material consumption, the **Standard Item Journal** page can make this recurring work easier. For more information, see [Work with Standard Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md#work-with-standard-journals).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Choose the **Post** action to adjust the quantities.

### To adjust bin quantities in advanced warehouse configurations

If your location uses directed put-away and picks, use the **Warehouse Item Journal** page to post unplanned positive and negative quantity changes. For example, for items posted as missing that show up unexpectedly, or losses due to breakage.  

Warehouse item journals give you more levels of adjustment to make your quantities more precise. The warehouse knows how many items are on hand and where they're stored, but each adjustment isn't posted to the item ledger. Credits or debits are made to the real bin with the quantity adjustment. A balancing entry is made in an adjustment bin. The adjustment bin is a virtual bin with no real items. You specify the virtual bin in the **Invt. Adjustment Bin Code** field on **Location Card** pages.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Item Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the header information.  
3. In the **Item No.** field on the line, choose the item.  
4. Enter the bin in which you're putting the extra items or where items are missing.  
5. In the **Quantity** field, if you find extra items, enter a positive quantity. If items are missing, enter a negative quantity.  
6. Choose the **Register** action.

## To synchronize the adjusted warehouse entries with the related item ledger entries

Post the adjustment bin records in the item ledger for the defined periods. Some companies post daily adjustments to the item ledger, while others reconcile less often.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields on each journal line.  
3. Choose the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** action, and then add filters on the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** page. Adjustments are calculated only for the entries in the adjustment bin that meet the filter requirements.  
4. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the **Document No.** field with a number. The number displays on the item journal lines.
5. Choose **OK**. The positive and negative adjustments are totaled for each item, and lines are created in the item journal.  
6. Post the journal lines to enter the quantity differences in the item ledger. The quantities in the bins and the item ledger now match.

* *ATHENS Desk* is *Draft* because we configured the default status for all added products to be *Draft*.
* *ATHENS Mobile Pedestal* is *Archived* because we configured the shop to automatically assign status *Archived* for deleted products.

Notice that inventory for ANTWERP Conference Table is 100, because we configured the system to use inventory only from two locations, MAIN and EAST. Inventory on another location (WEST) is ignored.

* Open *ANTWERP Conference Table*, notice the **Custom Type**, **Vendor**, **Weight**, and **Cost per item** fields, and the **Search engine listing preview** section.
* Open *Athens Desk*, scroll down to the **Variants** section, and notice how **SKU** is populated.

# Synchronize and fulfill sales orders

This article describes the settings and steps that you must complete to synchronize and fulfill sales orders with Shopify in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

## Set up the import of orders on the Shopify Shop Card

Enter a **currency code** if your online shop uses a different currency than the local currency (LCY). The specified currency must have exchange rates configured. If your online shop uses the same currency as [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], leave the field empty. 

You can access the Store Currency in the [Store details](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/general) settings in your Shopify Admin. Shopify can be configured to accept different currencies. However, imported orders into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] use store currency.

A regular Shopify order can include costs in addition to the subtotal, such as shipping charges or, if enabled, tips. These amounts are posted directly to the G/L account you want to use for specific transaction types:

* **Shipping Charges Account**: You can choose different types of shipping charges, such as G/L account, item, or item charge, and specify the shipping agent and shipping agent service on the **Shipping Charges** page. To learn more, go to [Shipment method mapping](#shipment-method-mapping).
* **Sold Gift Card Account**: Learn more at [Gift Card](synchronize-orders.md#gift-cards)
* **Tip account**  

Enable **Auto Create Orders** to automatically create sales documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] once the Shopify order is imported.

It can be useful for people who work with Shopify Admin to see whether orders synchronized to Business Central. In some cases, for example in high load environments, you might want to turn off synchronization. The **Add Business Central Doc. No. as Attribute** toggle gives you control over synchronization.

If you want to automatically release a sales document, turn on the **Auto Release Sales Order** toggle.

If you don't want to send automatic shipping confirmations to customers, turn off the **Send Shipping Confirmation** toggle. For example, you might turn off the toggle if you sell digital goods or want to use another notification mechanism.

If you select the **Shopify Order No. on Doc. Line** field, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] inserts sales lines of the type **Comment** with the Shopify order number.

> [!NOTE]
> The sales document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] links to the Shopify order, and you can add the **Shopify Order No.** field to the list or card pages for sales orders, invoices, and shipments. To learn more about adding a field, go to [Start personalizing by using the personalization mode](../ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode). 

In the **Tax area priority** field, prioritize how to select a tax area code for addresses on orders. The Shopify order you import contains information about taxes. Taxes are recalculated when you create sales documents, so it's important that the VAT or tax settings are correct in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about taxes, go to [Set Up Taxes for the Shopify Connection](setup-taxes.md).

Specify how you process returns and refunds:

* **Blank** specifies that you don't import and process returns and refunds.
* **Import only** specifies that you import information, but you manually create the corresponding credit memo.
* **Auto create credit memo** specifies that you import information and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates the credit memos. This option requires that you turn on the **Auto Create Sales Order** toggle.

#### Setup returns and refunds

Specify a location for returns, and G/L accounts for refunds for goods and other refunds.

You can use the original return location from Shopify for refunds and returns. The location helps ensure that locations are accurate on credit memos, which reduces manual adjustments and streamlines the returns process.

To turn on the feature, on the **Shopify Shop Card** page, in the **Return Location Priority** field choose **Original > Default Location**.

The **Return Location Priority** field offers the following options:

* **Default Return Location**: This is the default option. It uses the value from the Default Return Location field when creating sales credit memos.
* **Original > Default Location**: Select this option if you want the connector to find the original location on the Shopify refund or, if applicable, the Shopify return document. If the connector can't find the original location, for example, when an item is restocked in several locations, it uses the **Default Return Location** defined on the **Shopify Shop Card** page.

* **Refund Account non-restock Items** specifies a G/L Account No. for items where you don't want to have an inventory correction.
* **Refund Account** specifies a G/L account for the difference in the total refunded amount and the total amount of the items.

Learn more at [Returns and refunds](synchronize-orders.md#returns-and-refunds)

#### Time zone consideration

There are several cases when the connector converts Date Time values received from Shopify to Date values in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. The **Document Date** field on orders is one such field.

Shopify returns Date Time values as an ISO 8601-encoded date and time string. For example, 3:50 PM on September 7, 2019 in the time zone of UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is represented as "2019-09-07T15:50:00Z." If your company time zone is different, that might lead to errors in conversions. To prevent that, go to the **Company Information** page, locate the **Post Code** field, and verify that the **Time Zone** value of selected post code entry is populated.

### Shipment method mapping

The **Shipment method code** for sales documents imported from Shopify can be filled in automatically. You need to configure the **Shipment Method Mapping**.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Shops**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the shop for which you want to define a mapping to open the **Shopify Shop Card** page.
3. Choose the **Shipment Method Mapping** action. This action automatically creates records for shipping methods defined in the [**Shipping**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/payments) settings in your **Shopify admin**.
4. In the **Name** field, you can see the name of the shipping method from Shopify.
5. Enter the **Shipment Method Code** with the corresponding shipping method in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].
6. To use different accounts for shipping fees than the account specified in the **Shipping Charges Account** field on the **Shopify Shop Card** page, fill in the **Shipping Charges Type** and **Shipping Charges No.** fields. The Shopify Connector supports the following types:

   * G/L Account
   * Item
   * Item Charge. Item Charge is automatically assigned to all items on the sales document.

7. You can also find the **Shipping Agent Code** and **Shipping Agent Service Code** fields on the **Shopify Shipment Methods** page. If you fill them in, they populate the corresponding fields on the sales document.

> [!NOTE]  
> If multiple shipping charges are associated with a sales order, only one will be selected as the shipping method and assigned to the sales document.
>
> Shopify lets you add multiple shipment fees to an order. For example, by editing the order in the Shopify Admin. When you receive several shipping fees with a Shopify order, the Shopify Connector uses the first one to initialize the **Shipment Method Code**, **Shipping Agent Code**, and **Shipping Agent Service Code** fields in the header of the document.
>
> In some cases, Shopify merges multiple shipping rates into one value called **Shipping** and doesn’t transfer individual rates.

### Location mapping

The location mapping is required to fill in the **Location Code** for sales document lines imported from Shopify. This mapping is important when the **Location Mandatory** toggle is enabled on the **Inventory Setup** card. Otherwise, you can't create sales documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Shops**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the shop for which you want to configure the mapping of locations to open the **Shopify Shop Card** page.
3. Choose the **Locations** action to open the **Shopify Shop Locations**.
4. Choose the **Get Shopify Locations** action to import all the locations defined in Shopify. You can find them in the [**Locations**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/locations) settings in your **Shopify admin** panel. 
5. Enter the **Default Location Code** with the corresponding location in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]  
> Location mapping is also used to sync inventory. To learn more, go to [Sync inventory to Shopify](synchronize-items.md#sync-inventory-to-shopify).
  
## Run the order synchronization

The following procedure describes how to import and update the sales orders.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't import orders that are archived in Shopify. If you need to check the order status, open the order from the [orders](https://www.shopify.com/admin/orders) page of the **Shopify admin** panel and review its details.
>
> Deactivate the **Automatically archive the order** option in the **Order Processing** section of the **General** settings in your **Shopify Admin** panel to make sure that all orders are imported to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. If you need to import archived orders, use the **Unarchive Orders** action on the [Orders](https://www.shopify.com/admin/orders) page of the **Shopify admin** panel. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Shops**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the shop for which you want to import orders to open the **Shopify Shop Card** page.
3. Choose the **Orders** action.
4. Choose the **Sync Orders From Shopify** action.
5. Define filters on orders as necessary. For example, you can import fully paid orders or the ones with a low risk level.

   > [!NOTE]  
   > When filtering by tag, you should use filter tokens `@` and `*`. For example, if you want to import orders containing *tag1*, use `@*tag1*`. `@` will ensure the result is case insensitive, while `*` finds orders with multiple tags.

6. Choose the **OK** button.

Alternatively, you can search for the **Sync Orders From Shopify** batch job.

You can schedule the task to be performed automatically. Learn more at [Schedule recurring tasks](background.md#to-schedule-recurring-tasks).

### Under the hood

The Shopify Connector imports orders in two steps:

1. It imports order headers to the **Shopify Orders to Import** table when they match certain conditions:

   * They aren't archived. This means you can include or exclude orders from sync by archiving or unarchiving them in the Shopify Admin.
   * They were created or modified after the last sync. This means you can force reimport of a specific order if you modify it—for example, by adding **Notes** or **Tag**.

2. It imports Shopify orders and supplementary information.

   * The Shopify Connector processes all records in the **Shopify Orders to Import** table that match the filter criteria you defined on the **Sync Orders from Shopify** request page. For example, tags, channel, or the fulfillment status. If you don't specify filters, it processes all records.
   * When it imports a Shopify order, the Shopify Connector requests additional information from Shopify:

     * Order header
     * Order lines
     * Shipping and fulfillment information
     * Transactions
     * Returns and refunds, if configured

The **Shopify Orders to Import** page is useful for troubleshooting order import issues. It shows the newest orders on top. You can assess the orders that are available and take the next steps:

* Check whether an error blocked the import of a specific order, and explore the error's details. Check the **Has Error** field.
* Process only specific orders. Fill in the **Shop Code** field, select one or more orders, and then choose the **Import Selected Orders** action.
* Delete orders from the **Shopify Order to Import** page to exclude them from the sync.

## Review imported orders

After import completes, you can explore the Shopify order and find all related information. For example, the payment transactions, shipping costs, risk level, order attributes and tags, or fulfillments if the order was already fulfilled in Shopify. You can also see the order confirmation that was sent to the customer by choosing the **Shopify Status Page** action.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can navigate to the **Shopify Orders** window directly and you'll see orders with the *open* status from all shops. To review completed orders, you need to open the **Shopify Orders** page from the specific **Shopify Shop Card** page.

Before sales documents are created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], you can use the **Synch order from Shopify** action in the **Shopify Order** page to reimport specific orders.

You can also mark an order as paid, which is useful in a B2B scenario where payments are processed outside Shopify checkout. Choose the **Mark as Paid** action on the **Shopify Order** page. Also, you can mark an order as canceled to start the refund flow in Shopify. Choose the **Cancel Order** action on the **Shopify Order** page, fill in the fields as necessary on the **Shopify Cancel Order** page, and press **OK**. Run order synchronization to import the updates to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

## Create sales documents in Business Central

If the **Auto Create Orders** toggle is enabled on the **Shopify Shop Card**, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] tries to create a sales document after the order is imported. If issues such as a missing customer or product occur, fix the problems, and then create the sales order again.

### To create sales documents

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Shops**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the shop for which you want to synchronize orders to open the **Shopify Shop Card** page.
3. Choose the **Orders** action.
4. Select the order for which you want to create a sales document and choose the **Create Sales Documents** action.
5. Choose **Yes**.

If the Shopify order requires fulfillment, a **Sales Order** is created. For fulfilled Shopify orders, such as those orders that contain only a gift card or which are already handled in Shopify, a **Sales Invoice** gets created. 

A sales document is created and can be managed by using standard [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] functionality.

If you want to recreate a sales document, you can use the **Unlink Processed Documents** action in the **Shopify Order** page. This action doesn't delete the already created sales document. You must process it manually.

### Manage missing customers

If your settings prevent creating a customer automatically and a matching customer isn't found, assign a customer to the Shopify order manually. There are a few ways to assign customers to orders:

* Assign the **Sell-to Customer No.** and **Bill-to Customer No.** directly on the **Shopify Orders** page by choosing a customer from the list of existing customers.
* Select a customer template, then create and assign the customer via the **Create new customer** action on the **Shopify Orders** page. The Shopify customer must have at least one address. Orders you create via the Shopify POS sales channel are often missing address details.
* Map an existing customer to the related **Shopify Customer** on the **Shopify Customers** page, and then choose the **Find Mapping** action on the **Shopify Orders** page.

### How the connector chooses which customer to use

The *Import order from Shopify* function tries to select customers in the following order:

1. If the **Default Customer No.** field is defined in the **Shopify Customer Template** for the **Ship-to Country/Region Code**, then the **Default Customer No.** is used, regardless of the settings in the **Customer Import From Shopify** and **Customer Mapping Type** fields. Learn more at [Customer Template per Country](synchronize-customers.md#customer-template-per-countryregion).
2. If the **Customer Import From Shopify** is set to *None* and the **Default Customer No.** is defined on the **Shopify Shop Card** page, then the **Default Customer No.** is used.

The next steps depend on the **Customer Mapping Type**.

* If it's **Always take the default customer**, then the connector uses the customer defined in the **Default Customer No.** field on the **Shopify Shop Card** page.
* If it's **By EMail/Phone**, the connector tries to find the existing customer by ID first, then by email, and then by phone number. If the customer isn't found, the connector creates a new customer.
* If it's **By Bill-to Info**, the connector tries to find the existing customer by ID first and then by the bill-to address information. If the customer isn't found, the connector creates a new customer.

> [!NOTE]  
> The connector uses information from the bill-to address and creates the bill-to customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. The sell-to customer is the same as the bill-to customer.

For B2B orders, the flow is the similar although the connector uses the **Default Company No.**, **Company Import From Shopify**, and **Company Mapping Type** fields on the **Shopify Shop Card** page. There's no **Default Company No.** in the **Shopify Customer Template** because for B2B named customers are expected.

### Different processing rules for orders

You might want to process orders differently based on a rule. For example, orders from a specific sales channel, like POS, should use the default customer, but you want your online store to have real information about the customer.

One way to address this requirement is to create another Shopify Shop card and use filters in the **Sync Orders from Shopify** request page.

Example: You have an online store and a Shopify POS. For your POS, you want to use a fixed customer, but for your online store you want to create customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. The following procedure lists the high-level steps. To learn more, go to the corresponding help articles.

1. Create a Shopify shop called *STORE* and link it to your Shopify account.
1. Configure item/product synchronization so that this store manages product information.
1. Specify that customers are imported with orders. The connector should find customers by looking for their email address. If it doesn't find an address, it uses the customer template to create a new customer.
1. Create a Shopify shop called *POS* and link it to the same Shopify account.
1. Make sure that item/product synchronization is disabled.
1. Configure the connector to use the default customer.
1. Create a recurring job queue entry for Report 30104 **Sync orders from Shopify**. Select **STORE** in the **Shopify Shop Code** field, and use filters to catch all orders except the ones that the POS sales channel creates. For example, **<>Point of Sale**
1. Create a recurring job queue entry for Report 30104 **Sync orders from Shopify**. Select **POS** in the **Shopify Shop Code** field, and use filters to catch orders generated by the POS sales channel. For example, **Point of Sale**.

Each job queue imports and processes orders within the defined filters and uses the rules from the corresponding Shopify Shop card. For example, they create point of sales orders for the default customer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To avoid conflicts when processing orders, use the same job queue category for both job queue entries.

### Effect of order editing

In Shopify:

|Edit|Effect on Shopify Orders not yet processed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] | Effect on Shopify orders already processed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] |
|------|-----------|-----------|
|Change the fulfillment location | Fulfillment location is synched to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. | Fulfillment location is synched to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].|
|Edit an order and increase quantity|Imported order uses the new quantity.| Connector detects the change and marks the orders. |
|Edit an order and decrease quantity|Imported order uses the new quantity. A Shopify refund with zero amount is imported that can't be converted to a credit memo.| Connector detects the change and marks the orders. |
|Edit an order and remove existing item |Removed item isn't imported. A Shopify refund with zero amount is imported that can't be converted to a credit memo.| Connector detects the change and marks the orders. |
|Edit an order and add new item | Original and added items are imported. | Connector detects the change and marks the orders. |
|Process order: fulfill, update payment information | Order header is updated. |Order header is updated. The fulfillment isn't synchronized with Shopify.|
|Cancel paid order | Order header is updated, to be processed separately |Connector detects the change and marks the orders. |
|Cancel unpaid order | Removed item isn't imported. A Shopify refund with zero amount is imported that can't be converted to a credit memo. |Connector detects the change and marks the orders. |

If an order was already processed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], the connector displays the following error message: *The order has already been processed in Business Central, but an edition was received from Shopify. Changes were not propagated to the processed order in Business Central. Update the processed documents to match the received data from Shopify. If you wish to force the synchronization use the action "Sync order from Shopify" in the Shopify Order card page.*

Depending on status of the created sales document, you can perform following actions:

1. Delete created sales document
2. Choose the **Unlink Processed Documents** action to reset the **Processed** indicator.
3. Choose the **Synch order from Shopify** action to update the individual order with recent data from Shopify.

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]:

|Edit|Effect|
|------|-----------|
|Change the location to another location. Post shipment. | Order is marked as fulfilled. Fulfillment location from Shopify is used. |
|Decrease quantity. Post shipment. | The Shopify order is marked as partially fulfilled. |
|Increase quantity. Post shipment. | The fulfillment won't synchronize with Shopify. It's the same if the fulfillment was split in Shopify but processed as one line in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. |
|Add a new item. Post shipment. | The Shopify order is marked as fulfilled. New lines aren't added. |

## Export posted sales invoices to Shopify

You can export posted sales invoices to Shopify so that buyers can sign in to Shopify and access all their invoices, regardless of which app they were created in.

You can export posted sales invoices to Shopify as orders by using the **Sync Posted Invoices to Shopify** action on the Shopify Shop Card page, or you can use Tell Me search to find it. You can also run the report by using the job queue.

To enable the capability for a specific shop, go to the **Shopify Shop Card** page and turn on the **Posted Invoice Sync** toggle. You also need to configure the **Payment Terms Mapping**.

The sync includes invoices under the following conditions:

* The **Shopify Order ID** field contains **0**.
* The bill-to customer has a mapping in the **Shopify Customers** or **Shopify Companies** pages.
* The bill-to customer isn't used as the default customer on the **Shopify Shop Card** or **Shopify Customer Template**.
* The posted invoice has at least one non-comment line where the **No.** field has a value.

When you run the report, the following happens in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] and Shopify.

**Business Central**

Update the **Shopify Order ID** field based on the results of the sync:

* Successful export: update the **Shopify Order ID** field with the ID of the order in Shopify.
* Export failed: set "-1"
* Invoice is excluded from sync for a reason listed in the conditions mentioned earlier: set "-2"

>[!Note]
>The same pattern is used in the posted sales shipment, where the **Update Document** page lets you replace **-1** and **-2** with **0** to retry the export.

**Shopify**

The Shopify connector does the following steps:

* Creates a draft order with header and item lines
* Converts the draft order it to an order

**Fields export to order headers and lines**

The following fields export on the order header:

* The mapped bill-to customer/company is used.
* The **Fulfillment Status** field shows **Fulfilled**. Tracking details don't synchronize.
* The **Paid Status** field shows **Paid** or **Partially Paid**, based on the customer ledger entry linked to the sales invoice. For partially paid, it shows the **Remaining Amount** field.

The following fields export on the order lines:

* Items and lines of other types, such as **G/L Account** or **Item Charge** lines, export as custom products in Shopify.
* Shipping charges in Shopify aren't created. The shipping cost is registered as a custom product in Shopify.
* Tax amounts. Because the Graph API doesn't currently support the TaxLine object, the calculated tax is added as a custom product. Tax information from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] won’t be available in the tax report in Shopify Admin. To prevent Shopify from recalculating taxes, orders are marked as **Tax Exempt**.
* Quantity, in whole numbers. Shopify doesn’t support fractions.

### Effect on the process of synchronizing orders

Synchronization imports the order and checks whether it was exported earlier. If it was exported earlier:

* It marks the order as processed.
* It adds a link to the posted sales invoice (related documents, should happen automatically because the Shopify Order ID is already populated). Shopify might automatically archive fully paid and fulfilled orders, and the synchronization won't process them.

### Deal with updates

In Shopify, because the order is already fulfilled, the only meaningful changes are notes, payment status, and payment transactions. If payments are processed in Shopify, refunds and returns are as well.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't track changes. Currently, if you want to mark the order as paid, use the **Mark as Paid** action on the **Shopify Order Card** page.

## Synchronize shipments to Shopify

When a sales order created from a Shopify order is shipped, you can synchronize the shipments with Shopify.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sync Shipments to Shopify**, then choose the related link.
2. Define the filters on shipments as necessary. For example, you can update a shipment posted on a specific date.
3. Choose **OK**.

The order in Shopify is marked as fulfilled. The customer automatically receives a shipment notice email or text message (SMS). If a shipping agent and a tracking code are specified on the shipment, the tracking information is included in the email.

Alternatively, use the **Sync Shipments** action in the Shopify Sales Orders or Shopify Shop pages.

You can schedule the task to be performed in an automated manner. Learn more at [Schedule recurring tasks](background.md#to-schedule-recurring-tasks).

> [!Note]
> **Know limitations**. Orders with multiple lines of the same product will not be fulfilled. Mark such orders as fulfilled in Shopify Admin. This issue can occur when using the **Buy X get Y** discount with identical products for **Customer gets** and **Customer buys**.

Remember to run **Synchronize Orders from Shopify** to update the fulfillment status of an order in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. The connector functionality also archives completely paid and fulfilled orders in both Shopify and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], provided the conditions are met. 

### Shipping agents and tracking URL

If the **Posted Sales Shipment** document contains the **Shipping Agent Code** and/or **Package Tracking No.**, this information is sent to Shopify and to the customer in the shipping confirmation email.

The tracking company is populated in the following order (from highest to lowest) based on the shipping agent record:

1. **Shopify Tracking Company**
1. **Name**
1. **Code**

If the **Package Tracking URL** field is filled in for the shipping agent record, the shipping confirmation contains a tracking URL.

>[!Tip]
>If you don't want to send automatic shipping confirmations to customers, turn off the **Send Shipping Confirmation** toggle on the **Shopify Shop card** page.
>
>The **Shipping Agent Code** and **Shipping Agent Service Code** can be automatically filled in based on settings on the **Shipping Charges** page. To learn more, go to [Shipment method mapping](#shipment-method-mapping).

## Returns and refunds

In an integration between Shopify and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], it's important to be able to synchronize as much business data as possible. That makes it easier to keep your finance and inventory levels up to date in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. The data you can synchronize includes returns and refunds that were recorded in Shopify Admin or Shopify POS.

Returns and refunds are imported with their related orders if you enabled the processing type on the Shopify Shop Card.

Returns are imported for informational purposes only. No processing logic is associated with them.

Financial and, if needed, inventory transactions are processed via refunds. Refunds can include products or just amounts—for example, if a merchant decides to compensate shipping charges or some other amount.

You can create sales credit memos for refunds. The credit memos can have the following types of lines:

|Type|No.|Comment|
|-|-|-|
|G/L Account|Sold Gift Card Account| Use for refunds related to gift cards.|
|G/L Account|Refund Account Nonstock | Use for refunds related to products that weren’t restocked. |
|Item |Item No.| Use for refunds related to products that were restocked. Valid for direct refunds or refunds linked to returns. The location code on the credit memo line is set based on the value selected for the return location.|
|G/L Account| Refund Account | Use for other refunded amounts that aren't related to products or gift cards. For example, tips, or if you manually specified an amount to refund in Shopify. |

> [!Note]
> The return locations, including blank locations, defined in the **Shopify Shop Card** are used on the created credit memo. The system ignores the original locations from orders or shipments.

## Gift cards

In the Shopify shop you can sell gift cards, which can be used to pay for real products.

When dealing with gift cards, it's important to enter a value in the **Sold Gift Card Account** field in the **Shopify Shop Card** page. The sold gift card synchronizes together with the orders. An applied gift card also imports with the order, but now as a transaction. The gift card doesn't reduce the amount to invoice.

To review the issued and applied gift cards, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Gift Cards**, then choose the related link.

# Synchronize items and inventory

**Items** in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] are equivalent to **products** in Shopify. They're the physical goods, digital downloads, services, and gift cards that you sell. There are two main reasons to synchronize items:

1. When you primarily manage data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. You need to export all or some data from there into Shopify and make it visible. You can export the item name, description, image, prices, availability, variants, vendor details, and barcode. Once exported, you can review the items or make them visible immediately.
2. When an order from Shopify is imported, the information about items is vital to further document processing in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

The preceding two scenarios are always enabled.

A third scenario is to manage data in Shopify but import those items in bulk to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. This scenario can be useful for data migration events, such as when you want to connect an existing online shop with a new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] environment. The connector always creates or updates product variants in bulk.

## Define item synchronizations

1. Choose the search ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and enter **Shopify Shop**. Open the shop for which you want to configure the item synchronization.
2. From the **Sync item** field, select the required option.

   The following table outlines the options.

   |Option|Description|
   |------|-----------|
   |**Blank**| Products are imported together with the importing of orders. Products are exported to Shopify if a user runs the **Add Item** action from the **Shopify Products** page. This option is the default process.|
   |**To Shopify**| Select this option if, after the initial sync is triggered by the **Add Item** action, you plan to update products manually using the **Sync Product** action or using the job queue for recurring updates. Remember to enable the **Can Update Shopify Product** field. If it isn't enabled, it equals the **Blank** (default process) option. Learn more in the [Export items to Shopify](synchronize-items.md#export-items-to-shopify) section.|
   |**From Shopify**| Choose this option if you plan to import products from Shopify in bulk, either manually using the **Sync Product** action or using the job queue for recurring updates. To learn more, go to [Import items from Shopify](synchronize-items.md#import-items-from-shopify).|

   > [!NOTE]
   > Changing **Sync Item** from **From Shopify** to **To Shopify** won't have an effect unless you enable **Can Update Shopify Products**.

## Overview of ways to manage product information in both apps

Shopify and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] both offer extensive features for managing products and variants. Depending on your needs, you can choose different options. In Shopify, where you focus on convenience for customers, and in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], where other criteria is taken into consideration, such as the ability to define an assembly BOM.

|Product Information  |Business Central: Flat item list.<br><br>Only items, no variants  |Business Central: Items with item variants  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Shopify: Flat product list.</br>Only products, no variants.     | Supported<br><br>Import into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]<br><br>To point to an item in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], use the barcode or SKU fields on the Shopify product.<br><br>Export items from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] by using the **Add Item to Shopify** action.| Not supported<br><br>You can manually create products/items in both system independently, and use the barcode or SKU for automatic mapping or map products to item variants manually.|
|Shopify: Products with variants| Supported<br><br>We recommend that you select **Item No.**, **Vendor Item No.**, or **Barcode** in the **SKU Mapping** field and add the barcode or SKU on the variant to ensure that when a product/variant is imported from Shopify it finds the corresponding item in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].<br><br>Export from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] by using the **Add Items as Shopify Variants** action.| Supported<br><br>We recommend that you select **Item No.+Variant Code** in the **SKU Mapping** field and add the barcode or SKU on the variant to ensure that when you import the product or variant from Shopify it finds the corresponding item or variant in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].<br><br>Export from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] by using the **Add Item to Shopify** action.|

To learn more, go to [Effect of Shopify product SKUs and barcodes on mapping and creating item variants in Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/shopify/synchronize-items#effect-of-shopify-product-skus-and-barcodes-on-mapping-and-creating-items-and-variants-in-business-central).

## Import items from Shopify

First, import items either in bulk from Shopify or together with orders to add them to the **Shopify Product** and **Shopify Variant** tables. Then, map imported products and variants to items and variants in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. The connector always creates or updates product variants in bulk. Manage the process using the following settings:

|Field|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Auto create unknown items**|When Shopify products and variants are imported into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] function first tries to find the matching record in the item list. **SKU Mapping** impacts how the matching is performed and creates a new item and/or item variant. Enable this option if you want to create a new item or when a matching record doesn't exist. The new item is created using imported data and the **Item Template Code**. If this option isn't enabled, create an item manually and use the **Map Product** action on the **Shopify Products** page.|
|**Item Template Code**|Use this field with the **Auto create unknown items** toggle.<br>Choose the template you want to use for automatically created items.|
|**SKU Mapping**|Choose how you want to use the **SKU** value imported from Shopify during the item/variant mapping and creation. Learn more in the [Effect of Shopify product SKUs and barcodes on mapping and creating items and variants in Business Central](synchronize-items.md#effect-of-shopify-product-skus-and-barcodes-on-mapping-and-creating-items-and-variants-in-business-central) section.|
|**SKU Field Separator**|Use this field with **SKU Mapping** set to the **[Item. No + Variant Code](synchronize-items.md#effect-of-shopify-product-skus-and-barcodes-on-mapping-and-creating-items-and-variants-in-business-central)** option.<br>Define a separator to be used to split the SKU.<br>So, if in Shopify you create the variant with the SKU '1000/001', you'd type '/' in the **SKU Field Separator** field to make the item number in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] '1000' and the item variant code '001'. If you create the variant with the SKU '1000/001/111' in Shopify, the item number in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] is '1000' and the item variant code is '001'. The '111' part is ignored. |
|**Variant Prefix**|Use together with **SKU Mapping** set to either the **Variant Code** or **Item No. + Variant Code** option as a fallback function when the SKU coming from Shopify is empty.<br>If you want to create the item variant in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically, you to enter a value in **Code**. By default, the value defined in the SKU field imported from Shopify is used. However, if the SKU is empty, it generates code starting with the defined variant prefix and '001.'|
|**Shopify Can Update Item**|Choose this option if you want to update items and/or variants automatically.|
|**UoM as Variant**| Choose this option if you want all item units of measure to be exported as separate variants. To add the field, personalize the page. Learn more in the [Unit of Measure as Variant](synchronize-items.md#unit-of-measure-as-variant) section.|
|**Variant Option Name for UoM**| Use this field with **UoM as Variant** to specify under which option to add variants that represent units of measure. The default value is *Unit of Measure*. Use personalization to add the field to the page.|

## Export items to Shopify

There are multiple ways to export items to Shopify:

* Use the **Add item to Shopify** action directly from the **Item card** page.
* Use the **Add Item** action on the **Shopify Products** page.
* Use the **Add Item as Shopify Variants** action on the **Shopify Products** page.
* Run item synchronization once or repeatedly with automation.

No matter how you export items, specific item information is transferred to the Shopify products list depending on your choice of settings for item synchronization.

Before it exports an item to Shopify, the connector checks whether an item already exists. First, it checks whether there's a product or variant with a barcode, because it's defined in the **Item References** entry of a barcode type. If the **SKU Mapping** field is filled in, the connector checks whether there's a product or variant with a SKU. To learn more, go to [Effect of Shopify product SKUs and barcodes on mapping and creating items and variants in Business Central](synchronize-items.md#effect-of-shopify-product-skus-and-barcodes-on-mapping-and-creating-items-and-variants-in-business-central).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The product is added only to the **Online Store** sales channel. You need to publish products to other sales channels, like Shopify POS, from Shopify.

You manage the process of exporting items using these settings:

|Field|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Sync Item Extended Text**|Select this field to sync the extended text of the item. Because it's added to the **Description** field, it can contain HTML code. |
|**Sync Item Attributes**|Select this field to sync the item attributes. Attributes are formatted as a table and included in the **Description** field in Shopify.|
|**Sync Item Marketing Text**|Select this field to sync marketing text for the item. Although marketing text is a kind of description, it's different from an item's **Description** field. The **Description** field is typically used as a concise display name to quickly identify the product. The marketing text, on the other hand, is more rich and descriptive. Its purpose is to add marketing and promotional content. This text can then be published with the item in Shopify. There are two ways to create the marketing text. Use Copilot, which suggests AI-generated text for you, or start from scratch.|
|**Language Code**|Select this field if you want the translated versions used for title, attributes, and extended text. You can also export additional translations. To learn more, go to [Sync product translations to Shopify](synchronize-items.md#sync-product-translations-to-shopify).|
|**SKU Mapping**|Choose how you want to populate the SKU field in Shopify. Supported options are:</br> - **Item No.** to use the item number for both products and variants.</br> - **Item No.+ Variant Code** to create an SKU by concatenating values of two fields. For items without variants, the item number only is used.</br>- **Item Vendor No.** to use the item vendor number defined in the **Item Card** for both products and variants.</br> - **Barcode** to use the barcode type of **Item Reference**. This option respects variants.</br>If **Can Update Shopify Products** is enabled, changes in the **SKU Mapping** field will be propagated to Shopify after the next sync for all products and variants listed in the **Shopify Products** page for the selected shop.|
|**SKU Field Separator**|Define a separator for the **Item. No + Variant Code** option.|
|**Inventory Tracked**| Choose how the system should populate the **Track Inventory** field for products exported to Shopify. You can update availability information from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] for products in Shopify whose track inventory is enabled. Learn more in the [Inventory](synchronize-items.md#sync-inventory-to-shopify) section.|
|**Default Inventory Policy**|Choose *Deny* to prevent negative stock on the Shopify side. </br>If **Can Update Shopify Products** is enabled, changes in the **Default Inventory Policy** field will be propagated to Shopify after next sync for all products and variants listed in the **Shopify Products** page for selected shop.|
|**Can Update Shopify Products**|Define this field if [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] can only create items or can update items as well. Select this option if, after the initial sync is triggered by the **Add Item** action, you plan to update products manually using the **Sync Product** action or using the job queue for recurring updates. Remember to select **To Shopify** in the **Item Sync** field.</br>**Can Update Shopify Products** doesn't impact synchronization of prices, images, or inventory levels, which are configured by independent controls.</br>If **Can Update Shopify Products** is enabled, the following fields on the Shopify side are updated on the product and, if needed, the variant level: **SKU**, **Barcode**, **Weight**. The **Title**, **Product Type**, **Vendor**, and **Description** on the product are also updated if the exported values aren't empty. For description, this means you need to enable any of the **Sync Item Extended Text**, **Sync Item Marketing Text**, and **Sync Item Attributes** toggles and  attributes, extended or marketing text must have values. If the product uses variants, then the variant is added or removed if necessary. </br>If the product on Shopify is configured to use a variant matrix that combines two or more options, the Shopify Connector can't create a variant for that product. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], you can't define an option matrix, so the connector uses the **Variant Code** as the only option. However, Shopify expects several options and refuses to create a variant if information about other options is missing. |
|**UoM as Variant**| Choose this option if you want some options to be exported as imported as units of measure instead of variants. Personalize the page to add the field. Learn more in the [Unit of Measure as Variant](synchronize-items.md#unit-of-measure-as-variant) section.|
|**Variant Option Name for UoM**| Use this field with **UoM as Variant** to specify which option contains variants that represent units of measure. The default value is **Unit of Measure**. To add the field, personalize the page.|
|**Weight Unit**|When you enable the connector, it imports the default weight unit of measure from Shopify and uses it when it sends the weight of the product. You can change whether the **Net weight** field in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] stores values with different unit of measure.|

> [!NOTE]
> When you want to export many items and variants, some might be blocked. You can't include blocked items and variants in price calculations, so they aren't exported. The Connector skips those items and variants, so you don't need to filter them on the **Add Item to Shopify** request page.

### Activate sales channels

When you sync products from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to Shopify, you can choose which sales channels to activate directly from the **Shopify Sales Channels** page. The **Shopify Sales Channels** page shows all available channels in Shopify. Just activate the ones you want, and the Shopify Connector handles the rest. If you haven't set up this page yet, don't worry. Your products default to the Online Store.

### Sync product translations to Shopify

Automatically synchronizing translations from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to Shopify guarantees consistent product descriptions and details across various languages. Offering customers product information in their native language enhances accessibility and satisfaction, which can boost conversion rates and foster customer loyalty.

To include translations to the product synchronization, follow these steps:

1. Choose the **Tell Me**  icon, enter **Shopify shops**, and choose the related link.
2. Select the shop to open the **Shopify Shop Card** page.
3. To open the **Shopify Languages** page, choose the **Languages** action.
4. To import languages enabled on Shopify, choose the **Refresh** action. Notice that the primary language isn't be listed. For the primary language, continue to use the **Language Code** field in the **Shopify Shop Card**.
5. For each language to include in synchronization, fill in the **Language Code** field and turn on the **Sync translations** toggle.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Marketing text is only added for the primary language.
> * Extended texts are added for each language, plus extended texts where the **All Languages** toggle is turned on.
> * Attributes are added for each language. If a translation is missing, the primary language is used.
> * Item translations are added for each language if a translation is defined.
> * Variant translations aren't used because the connector only exports the variant code, and not its description.

## Advanced details

### Effect of Shopify product SKUs and barcodes on mapping and creating items and variants in Business Central

When products are imported from Shopify to **Shopify Products** and **Shopify Variants** tables, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] tries to find existing records.

The following table outlines the differences between options in the **SKU Mapping** field.

|Option|Effect on mapping|Effect on creation|
|------|-----------------|------------------|
|**Blank**|The SKU field isn't used in the item-mapping routine.|No effect on the creation of the item.</br>This option prevents the creation of variants. When in a sales order, only the main item is used. A variant can still be mapped manually on the **Shopify Product** page.|
|**Item No.**|Choose if the SKU field contains the item number.|No effect on the creation of an item without variants. For an item with variants, each variant is created as a separate item.</br>If Shopify has a product with two variants and their SKUs are '1000' and '2000', [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] creates two items numbered '1000' and '2000'.|
|**Variant Code**|The SKU field isn't used in the item-mapping routine.|No effect on creation of the item. When an item variant is created, the value of the SKU field is used as a code. If the SKU is empty, a code is generated using the **Variant Prefix** field.|
|**Item No. + Variant Code**|Select this option if the SKU field contains an item number and the item variant code is separated by the value defined in the **SKU Field Separator** field.|When an item is created, the first part of the value of the SKU field is designated **No.**. If the SKU field is empty, an item number is generated using the number series defined in the **Item Template Code** or **Item Nos.** field of the **Inventory Setup** page.</br>When an item is created, the variant function uses the second part of the value of the SKU field as **Code**. If the SKU field is empty, a code is generated using the **Variant Prefix** field.|
|**Vendor Item No.**|Choose if the SKU field contains the vendor item number. In this case, the **Item Vendor No.** isn't used on the **Item Card** page; rather the **Vendor Item No.** from the **Item Vendor Catalog** is used. If the *Item Vendor Catalog* record contains a variant code, that code is used to map the Shopify variant.|If a corresponding vendor exists in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], the SKU value is used as the **Vendor Item No.** on the **Item Card** page and as the **Item Reference** of the *vendor* type. </br>Prevents the creation of variants. It's useful when you want to use only the main item in the sales order. You're still able to map a variant manually from the **Shopify Product** page.|
|**Barcode**|Choose if the SKU field contains a barcode. A search is performed among **Item References** of the *barcode* type. If the item reference record contains a variant code, that variant code is used to map the Shopify variant.|No effect on the creation of the item. </br>Prevents the creation of variants. It's useful when you want to use only the main item in the sales order. You're still able to map a variant manually from the **Shopify Product** page.|

The following table outlines the effects of the **Barcode** field.

|Effect on mapping|Effect on creation|
|-----------------|------------------|
|A search is performed on the **Item References** containing a barcode type as the value in the **Barcode** field in Shopify. If the item reference record contains a variant code, that variant code is used to map the Shopify variant.|The barcode is saved as **Item Reference** for the item and item variant.|

> [!NOTE]  
> You can trigger mapping for the selected products/variants by choosing **Try Find Product Mapping** or for all the imported unmapped products by choosing **Try Find Mappings**.

### Import and export product information using Shopify Metafields

Shopify's platform includes data models for fundamental commerce concepts. However, commerce is diverse and often requires more complex or specific data models. The custom data platform enables you to extend Shopify's data models and create your own by using metafields. Metafields are a flexible way to add and store additional information about a Shopify resource, such as a product or variant. The additional information stored in metafields can be almost anything related to a resource. Some examples are specifications, size charts, downloadable documents, release dates, images, or part numbers.

You can import and export data stored in metafields. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] also provides an extensibility model that allows developers to map standard or custom fields, attributes, or other related entries in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to metafields in Shopify.

You can access and edit metafields on the **Shopify Metafields** page, which you open from the **Shopify Products** and **Shopify Variants** pages.

> [!NOTE]
> The page is editable if the **Product Sync** field is set to **Products to Shopify**, and the **Can update Shopify products** toggle is turned on. When you add a record, the connector immediately sends a request to Shopify and stores the entry only when it gets a response with the Shopify ID for the metafield.
> Further edits of records synchronize with Shopify during the next product synchronization.
> You can't edit types that have AssistEdit functionality defined directly on the line.

#### Supported metafield content types

**Date and time:**

* Date
* Date and time

**Measurements:**

* Dimension
* Volume
* Weight

**Number:**

* Decimal
* Integer

**Text:**

* Single line text
* Multi-line text

> [!NOTE]
> Rich text isn't supported.

**References:**

* Product
* Variant
* Collection
* File
* Metaobject
* Page

> [!NOTE]
> Company and Customer aren't supported.

**Other:**

* True or false
* Color
* URL
* Money
* NOT SUPPORTED: Link
* NOT SUPPORTED: Rating

**Advanced:**

* Mixed reference
* JSON

### Tags

Review the imported tags in the **Tags** FactBox on the **Shopify Product** page. On the same page, to edit tags, choose the **Tags** action.

If the **To Shopify** option is selected in the **Sync Item** field, assigned tags are exported to Shopify at the next synchronization.

### Unit of measure as variant

Shopify doesn't support multiple units of measure. If you want to sell the same product as, for example, piece, and set and use different prices or discounts, you must create units of measure as product variants.

You can configure the Shopify connector to export units of measure as variants, or import variants as units of measure.

To enable this capability, use the **UoM as Variant** and **Variant Option Name** fields on the **Shopify Shop Card** page. The fields are hidden by default. To add them to the page, use personalization.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * When you're dealing with a matrix of variants, for example Color and UoM, and you want to import products into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], you should set *Item No. + Variant Code* in the **SKU Mapping** field and make sure that the **SKU** field in Shopify has the same value for all units of measure and include both item numbers and variant codes.
> * [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] calculates availability per item/item variant and not by unit of measure. The same availability is assigned to each variant representing the unit of measure (with respect to **Qty. per Unit of Measure**), which can lead to cases where the available quantity in Shopify isn't accurate. Example: Item that is sold in PCS and Box of six. The inventory in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] is six PCS. Item is exported to Shopify as Product with two variants. After inventory syncs, the inventory level in Shopify is six for variant PCS and one for variant Box. The buyer can explore the store and see that product is available in both options and place an order for one Box. The next buyer can see that Box isn't available, but there are still six PCS. The value will update with the next inventory sync.
> * You can't add a unit of measure option to existing products with variants (specific result depends on other settings, such as **SKU Mapping**).

### URL and Preview URL

An item added to Shopify or imported from Shopify might have the **URL** or **Preview URL** populated. The **URL** field is blank if the product isn't published to the online store—for example, because its status is draft. The **URL** is empty if the store is password protected—for example, because it's a development store. In most cases, you can use the **Preview URL** to check how the product looks when you publish it.

## Run item synchronization

Full or partial item synchronization can be performed in many different ways.

### Initial sync of items from Business Central to Shopify

1. Go to the search ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Products**, and choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Add Items** action.
3. In the **Shop Code** field, enter the code. If you open the **Shopify Product** window from the **Shop Card** page, the shop code is filled in automatically.
4. If you configured image and inventory sync, you can include them in the same process. Including them in the same process is convenient for demo scenarios or when dealing with smaller amounts of data.
5. Define filters on items as required. For example, you can filter by the item number or item category code.
6. Choose **OK**.

The resulting items are automatically created in Shopify with prices. Depending on choices you made, images and inventory levels might be included. The operation might take some time if a large number of items are added.

Alternatively, you can sync one item by choosing the **Add to Shopify** action in the **Item Card** page.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Initial sync of items from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to Shopify doesn't consider **Sync Item** and **Can Update Shopify Products** settings. 

### Adding item as variant to Shopify products

If your products in Shopify have variants, but the list of items is flat on the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] side you can use the **Add item as Variant** action on the **Variants** FastTab of the **Shopify Products** page.

Items are added as Shopify variants under the existing product option. For example, color, material, or title, if the product only had the default variant. If the Shopify product has more than one option, you can't add the item as a Shopify variant.

> [!NOTE]
> You can add item as variants if it has its own item variants, however, only the item itself is added, and not item variants.
>
> You can't add an item as a variant if the **UOM as Variant** toggle is turned on on the **Shopify Shop Card** page.
>
> Shopify always creates a variant, even if you haven’t defined any. This variant is called **Default title**. When you add more variants via **Shopify Admin**, this technical variant entry is deleted. The Shopify connector runs similar logic. When the first item is added to Shopify as a product, the Default title variant is added to Shopify and to Business Central. When you run the **Add Item as Shopify Variants** action, the selected item is added as a variant and the default variant is deleted in both Shopify and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].
>
> When it adds an item as a variant, the connector doesn’t search by SKU or barcode.

### Sync products from Shopify to Business Central

1. Go to the search ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Shop**, and choose the related link.
2. Select the shop for which you want to synchronize items to open the **Shopify Shop Card** page.
3. Choose the **Sync Products** action.

Alternatively, use the **Sync Products** action on the **Shopify Products** page or search for the **Sync Products** batch job.

You can schedule the task to be performed in an automated manner. Learn more at [Schedule recurring tasks](background.md#to-schedule-recurring-tasks).

### Ad-hoc updates of Shopify products

When the records are updated in the **Shopify Product** table, the following changes are synchronized with Shopify.

Update:

* **Status** - You can choose between active, archived, or draft.
* **SEO Title**
* **SEO Description**

Deletion:

Based on the value in **Action for Removed Products and Blocked Items** on the **Shopify Shop Card** page, the product gets updated in Shopify when the record is deleted from the **Shopify Products** page.

* **Blank**: Nothing happens. If needed, perform the required action from the **Shopify admin**.
* **Status to Draft**: The status of the product in Shopify is set to *Draft*.
* **Status to Archived**: The product is archived in Shopify.

## Sync item images

Synchronization of images can be configured for synchronized items. Choose from the following options:

* **Disabled**: Image synchronization is deactivated.
* **To Shopify**: Images of items are exported to Shopify.
* **From Shopify**: Images from Shopify are imported to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

Image synchronization can be initialized in the two ways described in the next sections in this article.

### Sync product images from the Shopify shop page

1. Go to the search ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Shops**, and choose the related link.
2. Select the shop for which you want to synchronize images to open the **Shopify Shop Card** page.
3. Choose the **Sync Product Images** action.

### Sync product images from the Shopify products page

1. Go to the search ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Products**, and choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Sync Product Images** action.

> [!NOTE]
> There are a few things to note about image synchronization.
>
> * When you export images from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to Shopify, the images replace the ones you exported previously. The earlier images are no longer available.
> * If you delete an image in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], the image in Shopify isn't also deleted. You need to manually delete the old images in the **Shopify Admin**.
> * Images you export to Shopify must comply with Shopify's requirements. Otherwise, you can't import them. To learn more about media requirements, go to [product media types on help.shopify.com](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/product-media/product-media-types#images).

## Sync prices with Shopify

The Connector can send one main price and one nondiscounted price to Shopify. The prices show in the **Price** and **Compare at Price** fields on the Shopify Product (Shopify Variant) page.

The following table describes the settings you can use to manage the process of defining and exporting prices.

|Field|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Customer Price Group**|Determine the price for an item in Shopify. The sales price of this customer price group is taken. If no group is specified, the price on the item card is used. The Connector doesn't use the customer price group from the customer.|
|**Customer Discount Group**|Determine the discount to use when calculating the price of an item in Shopify. Discounted prices are stored in the **Price** field and the full price is stored in the **Compare at Price** field. The Connector doesn't use the customer discount group from the customer.|
|**Allow Line Disc.**|Specifies whether you allow a line discount when calculating prices for Shopify. This setting applies only for prices on the item. Prices for the customer price group have their own toggle on lines.|
|**Prices including VAT**|Specifies whether price calculations for Shopify include VAT. Learn more at [Set up Taxes](setup-taxes.md).|
|**VAT Business Posting Group**|Specifies which VAT business posting group is used to calculate prices in Shopify. Use your group for domestic customers. Learn more at [Set up Taxes](setup-taxes.md).|
|**Currency Code**|Enter a currency code only if your online shop uses a different currency than the local currency (LCY). The specified currency must have exchange rates configured. If your online shop uses the same currency as [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], leave the field empty.|

You can export prices for synchronized items in the ways described in the following sections in this article.

### Sync prices from the Shopify products page

1. Go to the search ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Products**, and choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Sync Prices to Shopify** action.

> [!NOTE]
> There are a few things to note about price calculations.
>
> * When it determines a price, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] uses the "lowest price" logic. However, the lowest price logic ignores the unit price defined on the item card if a price is defined in the price group. This is true even if the unit price from the item card price is lower.
> * To calculate prices, the connector creates a temporary sales quote for the item with a quantity of 1, and uses standard price calculation logic. Only prices and discounts that are applicable for quantity 1 are used. You can't export different prices or discounts based on quantity.
> * The connector sends a request to update prices in Shopify if the price in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] changed. For example, if you synchronized products and prices and then changed a price in Shopify, choosing the **Sync Prices to Shopify** action doesn't affect the price in the Shopify because the new price calculated by the connector is the same as the price stored in the Shopify Variant from the previous sync. The **Compare at Price** is updated only if the main price changed.

### Price synchronization for B2B

[!INCLUDE [shopify-preview](../includes/shopify-preview.md)]

If you use Shopify B2B, you can configure the Connector to synchronize prices for Shopify Catalogs linked to B2B customers.

#### Synchronize catalogs from the Shopify

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Catalogs**, and select the related link.
2. Select **Get Catalogs**.
3. Select the entry for which to define and export prices, and then fill in the fields as necessary.

   You can use two strategies. One is the default strategy, where you can use settings similar to the ones for synchronizing the **Price** and **Compare at Price** fields for Shopify products (Shopify variant). The following table describes settings for the default strategy.

   |Field|Description|
   |------|-----------|
   |**Customer Price Group**|Determine the price for an item in Shopify. The sales price of this customer price group is taken. If no group is specified, the price on the item card is used.|
   |**Customer Discount Group**|Determine the discount to use when calculating the price of an item in Shopify. Discounted prices are stored in the **Price** field and the full price is stored in the **Compare at Price** field. |
   |**Allow Line Disc.**|Specifies whether you allow a line discount when calculating prices for Shopify. This setting applies only for prices on the item. Prices for the customer price group have their own toggle on lines.|
   |**Prices including VAT**|Specifies whether price calculations for Shopify include VAT. |
   |**VAT Business Posting Group**|Specifies which VAT business posting group is used to calculate prices in Shopify. This should be the group you use for domestic customers. |

   The second strategy is to use the new **Customer No.** field. In this case, the connector uses the customer to calculate the price. It ignores other values defined in the Shopify Catalog entry, and uses the **Customer Price Group**, **Customer Discount Group**, and **Allow Line Discount** fields from the customer card. Use personalization to add the **Customer No.** field to the **Shopify Catalog** page.

4. After you enter the settings, turn on the **Sync Prices** toggle and choose **Sync Prices** to start synchronizing catalog prices.

You can only access catalogs linked to B2B companies. For more information, see [B2B Companies](synchronize-customers.md#b2b-companies). Note that catalogs don't contain products. You manage catalog content in Shopify Admin.

#### Sync prices for B2B Catalog

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Catalogs**, and select the related link.
2. Select the entry for which to define and export prices.
3. Use the available settings to configure how to define prices. The settings are similar to ones used for synchronization of **Price** and **Compare at Price** fields in the Shopify Product (Shopify Variant).
4. Turn on the **Sync Prices** toggle.
5. Choose **Sync Prices**, and wait for synchronization to complete.

## Sync inventory to Shopify

Inventory synchronization can be configured for already synchronized items. There are two conditions that must be met:

1. Inventory tracking must be enabled for a product in Shopify. If items are exported to Shopify, consider enabling the **Inventory Tracked** toggle on the **Shopify Shop** page. Learn more in the [Export items to Shopify](synchronize-items.md#export-items-to-shopify) section.
2. Inventory sync must be enabled for **Shopify Locations**.

### To enable inventory sync

1. Go to the search ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Shop**, and choose the related link.
2. Select the shop for which you want to synchronize inventory to open the **Shopify Shop Card** page.
3. Choose the **Locations** action to open **Shopify Shop Locations**.
4. Choose the **Get Shopify Locations** action to import all the locations defined in Shopify. You can find them in the [**Locations**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/locations) settings in your **Shopify Admin**.
5. In the **Location Filter** field, add locations if you want to include inventory from specific locations only. So, you could enter *EAST|WEST* to make the inventory from only these two locations available for sales via the online shop.
6. Select the stock calculation method to use for the selected Shopify locations.
7. Enable **Default Product Location** if you want location to be used for creation of inventory records and to participate in the inventory synchronization.

You can initialize inventory synchronization in the ways described in the following sections in this article.

### Sync inventory from the Shopify shop page

1. Go to the search ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Shops**, and choose the related link.
2. Select the shop for which you want to synchronize inventory to open the **Shopify Shop Card** page.
3. Choose the **Sync inventory** action.

### Sync inventory from the Shopify products page

1. Go to the search ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Products**, and choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Sync inventory** action.

> [!NOTE]
> There are a few things to note about synchronizing inventory:
>
> * There are two standard stock calculation methods: **Projected Available Balance at date** and **Free Inventory (Not reserved)**. With extensibility, you can add more options. To learn more about extensibility, go to [examples](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-extending-shopify#stock-calculation). 
> * If the stock information in Shopify is different than the **Projected Available Balance** in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], the stock updates in Shopify.
> * When you add a new location in Shopify, you also need to add inventory records for it. Shopify doesn't do that automatically for existing products and variants, and the connector doesn't synchronize inventory levels for such items in the new location. To learn more, go to [Assigning inventory to locations](https://help.shopify.com/manual/locations/assigning-inventory-to-locations).
> * Both **Business Central Fulfillment Services** and normal locations are supported and can be used for shipping and inventory.
> * When dealing with bundles, check whether adjusting inventory via an API is allowed for those products. For example, the **Shopify Bundles** app calculates availability of bundles based on the availability of the components and prevents updates via APIs. It's good idea to map Shopify products of the type Bundle to items of the type Non-inventory. Non-inventory and service items are excluded from the inventory synchronization.

#### Example of calculation of projected available balance

There are 10 pieces of item A available on hand and two outstanding sales orders. One for Monday with quantity *One* and one for Thursday with quantity *Two*. Depending on when you sync inventory, the stock level in Shopify updates with different quantities.

|When sync inventory is run|Value used to update stock level|Comment|
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
|Tuesday|9|Inventory 10 minus sales order set to ship on Monday|
|Friday|7|Inventory 10 minus both sales orders|

#### Example of calculation of available inventory (not reserved)

There are 10 pieces of item A available on hand and three outstanding sales orders. One order with quantity *1* reserved from item ledger entry, one with quantity *2* not reserved, and one with quantity *3* reserved from a purchase order. For this method, the date of synchronization isn't important.

|Value used to update stock level|Comment|
|-----------------|-----------------|
|9|Inventory 10 minus the sales order with reserved inventory from item ledger entry. Other sales orders are ignored.|

### Two approaches to manage fulfillments

There are two ways to deal with fulfillment in Shopify:

* Shopify "built-in" fulfillment and inventory tracking
* Third party fulfillment and inventory tracking

Inventory for each product in Shopify can be stocked by Shopify or by 3PL.

If you use Shopify fulfillment, then you can also define multiple locations in Shopify. Once order is created, Shopify selects location based on availability and priority. You can also specify the locations where you plan to track a specific product, for example never sell from location *ShowRoom*.

If you use 3PL physical handling is taken care of by 3PL provider, so locations aren't needed. For 3PL the SKU field becoming mandatory.

When you decide on which location to track item, Shopify creates records in the **Inventory Levels** table, which can be updated manually with inventory availability.

The connector supports both modes. It can send inventory to multiple Shopify locations or work as a fulfillment service.

From the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] perspective, when you create item and want to send it to Shopify you also want to:

* Use **Default Product Location** toggle to specify whether the item is fulfilled by Shopify fulfillment or by 3PL. There's always **Business Central Fulfillment Service**, but there can be more fulfillments services if more apps are installed. You can enable **Default Product Location** only in one record if you want to use a fulfillment service.
* use **Default Product Location** toggle to specify which locations you want to use to track inventory. You can turn on **Default Product Location** for multiple locations where **Is Fulfillment Service** is disabled. Note that inventory is always tracked for a primary location.

#### What's the difference?

Shopify fulfillment is useful when using Shopify POS and there are multiple physical stores. You want employees in the physical store to know their current inventory. In this case, you create multiple locations in Shopify, multiple locations in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], and activate a **Default Product Location** for all these locations.  

If you handle logistics in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], where you can have many locations, you don't create locations in Shopify. The connector creates Business Central Fulfillment Services automatically and you can link inventory via location filters from several locations to one fulfillment services record. As a result, in Shopify there's no information about where goods are sent from—it only has tracking information, while in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], you can select based on availability and proximity to the destination.

#### Example of using Default Product Location toggle

After you choose the **Get Shopify Locations** action in the **Shopify Locations** page, you see the following locations:

|Name|Is Fulfillment Service|Is Primary|
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
|Main| |**Yes**|
|Second| | |
|Business Central Fulfillment Service|**Yes**| |

Let's review the affect of enabling the **Default Product Location** toggle:

|Name of locations where Default Product Location toggle is turned on|Effect on how the product is created in Shopify|
|------|-----------------|
|Main| Inventory is stocked at: Multiple locations; Selected locations: Main (primary) |
|Main and Second| Inventory is stocked at: Multiple locations; Selected locations: Main and Second |
|Business Central Fulfillment Service|Inventory is stocked at: Business Central Fulfillment Service; Selected locations: (App) Business Central Fulfillment Service|
|Business Central Fulfillment Service and Main| Error: You can't use standard Shopify Locations with FulFillment Service Locations|

### Troubleshooting inventory synchronization

If the inventory level fails to sync with Shopify, try these checks.

1. Go to the **Shopify Shop Locations** page and verify the value chosen in the **Stock calculation** field. To learn more, go to [To enable inventory sync](synchronize-items.md#to-enable-inventory-sync).
2. In the **Shopify admin**, go to **Products** or **Variants** and check that the **Track quantity** toggle is turned on.
3. In the **Shopify admin**, go to **Products** or **Variants** and see whether all locations appear in the **Inventory** section. If a location is missing, it means the inventory level isn't defined. To learn more, go to [Assigning inventory to locations](https://help.shopify.com/manual/locations/assigning-inventory-to-locations).
4. Go to the **Shopify Products** page, locate the specific product, and ensure that the Shopify variant is linked to the item and item variant, if needed. To do that, examine the **Item No.** and **Variant No.** fields in the **Shopify Variants** part.
5. Go to the **Shopify Products** page, locate the specific product, and check the stock details in the **Shopify Inventory** FactBox. The FactBox gives an overview of the Shopify stock and the last calculated inventory in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. It also shows when when the specific inventory level was last synchronized. There's one record per location.
6. Go to the **Shopify Log Entries** page, and check for entries with the **Has Error** enabled around the time the inventory level was synched (see previous step). To limit records, apply the **mutation inventorySetOnHandQuantities** filter to the **Request Preview** field. If such entries exist, open the **Shopify Log Entry** page and inspect the **Response Data** field. If there's a validation error on Shopify's side, the response includes the additional information in the **userErrors** section. To learn more about logging, go to [Logs](troubleshoot.md#logs).

# Synchronize customers and companies

When you import an order from Shopify, getting the information about the customer is essential for further processing the document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. There are two main options for doing so, and several combinations:

* Use a special customer for all orders.
* Import the customer information from Shopify. This option is also available when you export customers to Shopify from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

Shopify allows you to run your business to business (B2B) and direct to customer (DTC) business from one place with the power and ease of Shopify's all-in-one platform. Shopify Connector also works with different flavors of e-commerce.

While Shopify has two entities—customer and company—[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] has only the customer entity, which affects how synchronization works.

When you run DTC, the buyer is created in Shopify as a customer. The customer is then imported to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] as a Shopify customer, and linked or converted to a customer.

If you run B2B, the buyer is created in Shopify as a customer linked to a company. The customer is imported to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] as a Shopify customer, and the company is imported to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] as a Shopify company and linked or converted to a customer.

To export a customer from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to Shopify, the steps are different depending on what you want to do:

* Export a customer as a Shopify customer for DTC.
* Export a customer as a company and customer pair for the B2B flow.

## Important settings when importing DTC customers from Shopify

Whether you import customers from Shopify in bulk or when you import orders, use the following settings to manage the process:

|Field|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Customer Import from Shopify**|Select **All Customers** if you plan to import customers from Shopify in bulk; either manually using the **Sync Customers** action or via the job queue for recurring updates. Regardless of the selection, the customer information will always be imported together with the order. However, the use of this information depends on the **Shopify Customer Templates** and settings in the **Customer Mapping Type** field.|
|**Customer Mapping Type**|Define how you want the connector to perform the mapping.</br></br>- **By Email/Phone** if you want the connector to use email account and telephone information to map the imported Shopify customer to a customer in Business Central.</br></br>- **By Bill-to Info** if you want the connector to use the address of the invoice recipient to map the imported Shopify customer to an existing customer in Business Central.</br></br>- **Always Take the Default Customer** if you want the system to use a customer from the **Default Customer No.** field. |
|**Shopify Can Update Customers**| Select this field if you want the connector to update the customers it finds when either of the **By Email/Phone** or **By Bill-to Info** options are selected in the **Customer Mapping Type** field.|
|**Auto Create Unknown Customers**| Select this field if you want the connector to create missing customers when the **By Email/Phone** or **By Bill-to Info** options are selected in the **Customer Mapping Type** field. A new customer is created using imported data and the **Customer Template Code** defined on the **Shopify Shop Card** or **Shopify Customer Template** pages. Notice that the Shopify customer must have at least one address. Orders created via Shopify POS sales channel are often missing address details. If this option isn't enabled, you must create a customer manually and link it to the Shopify customer.|
|**Customer.Company Template Code**|Use this field together with **Auto Create Unknown Customers**.</br></br>Choose the default template to use for automatically created customers. Make sure the selected template contains the mandatory fields such as **Gen. Business Posting Group**, **Customer Posting Group**, and value-added tax (VAT) or tax-related fields.</br></br>You can define templates per country/region on the **Shopify Customer Templates** page, which helps calculate taxes correctly.</br></br>Learn more at [Set Up Taxes](setup-taxes.md).|

### Customer template per country/region

Some settings can be defined at the country/regional level or a state/province level. The settings can be configured in [Shipping and Delivery](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/shipping) in Shopify.

You can do the following for each customer using the **Shopify Customer Template**:

1. Specify the **Default Customer No.**, which takes priority over the selection in the **Customer Import from Shopify** and **Customer Mapping Type** fields. It's used in the imported sales order.
2. Define the **Customer Template Code**, which is used to create missing customers if **Auto Create Unknown Customers** is enabled. If the **Customer Template Code** is empty, then the function uses the **Customer Template Code** defined on the **Shopify Shop Card**. The system first tries to find a template for the **Country/Region Code** for the default address. If it doesn't find a template, it uses the first address.
3. In some cases, the **Customer Template Code** defined for a country/region isn't enough to ensure correct tax calculations (for example, for countries/regions with sales tax). In this case, including **Tax Area** could be a useful addition.
4. The **Tax Area** field also contains a **Country Code** and **County Name** pair. This pair is useful when the connector needs to convert a code to a name, or vice versa.

> [!NOTE]  
> The country codes are ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes. Learn more at [Country Code](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/custom-storefronts/storefront-api/reference/enum/countrycode).

### Populate customer information in Business Central

A customer in Shopify has a first name, family name, email, and/or phone number. A customer might also have multiple addresses that might contain a company and address in addition to their first name, family name, and/or phone number. The following table describes how data from the customer and address is imported into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. Note that while the customer might have multiple addresses, only one is marked as default and is used to populate fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

|[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]|Field when imported from Shopify|
|------|-----------------|
|Name| Based on the selection in the **Name Source** field, this field can contain first and last name, or company from the default address. |
|Name 2|Based on the selection in the **Name 2 Source** field, this field can contain first and last name, or company from the default address. </br>Field is populated only if **Name** already has a value. Otherwise, the extracted value is assigned to the **Name** field. |
|Contact |Based on the selection in the **Contact Source** field, this field can contain first and last name, or company from the default address. </br>Field is populated only if **Name** already has value. Otherwise, the extracted value is assigned to the **Name** field. |
|Country / Region Code| Country from the default address. Mapping is done by ISO code.|
|County | State/Province from the default address. Based on selection in the **State Source** field, it can be a code or description.|
|Post Code| Zip code from the default address.|
|City| City from the default address.|
|Phone| Phone number from the default address. If a phone number isn't defined for the default address, then it's the phone number from the customer.|
|Email|Email address from the customer.|

The **Tax Area Code**, **Tax Liable**, **VAT Bus. Posting Group** are from the [customer template](#customer-template-per-countryregion). 

## Important settings when exporting DTC customers to Shopify

You can export existing customers to Shopify in bulk. In each case, a customer and one default address are created. You can manage the process using the following settings:

|Field|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Can update Shopify Customers**| Enable this option if you want to generate updates later from Business Central for customers that already exist in Shopify.|

The following are requirements for exporting a customer:

* The customer must have a valid email address.
* When a country/region is selected on the customer card, make sure to fill in the **ISO Code** field. For local customers with a blank country/region, Shopify Connector uses the country/region specified on the **Company Information** page. That is especially important when you export customers with addresses that include provinces/states.
* If the customer has a phone number, the number must be unique because Shopify won't accept a second customer with the same phone number. The phone number must be in the E.164 format. Different formats are supported if they represent a number that can be dialed from anywhere in the world. The following formats are valid:

  * xxxxxxxxxx
  * +xxxxxxxxxxx
  * (xxx)xxx-xxxx
  * +x xxx-xxx-xxxx

After you create the customers in Shopify, you can send them direct invitations to encourage them to activate their accounts.

### Populate customer information in Shopify

A customer in Shopify has a first name, family name, email, and/or phone number. You can enter first and family names from the customer card in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

|Priority|Field in the customer card|Description|
|------|------|-----------|
|1|**Contact Name**|Highest priority, if the **Contact Name** field is filled and the **Contact Source** field in the **Shopify Shop Card** contains either the *First Name and Last Name* or *Last Name and First Name* option to define how to split the values.|
|2|**Name 2**|If the **Name 2** field is filled in and the **Name 2 Source** field in the **Shopify Shop Card** contains either the *First Name and Last Name* or *Last Name and First Name* option to define how to split the values.|
|3|**Name**|Lowest priority, if the **Name** field is filled and the **Name Source** field in the **Shopify Shop Card** contains either the *First Name and Last Name* or *Last Name and First Name* options to define how to split the values.|

A customer in Shopify also has a default address. The address might contain a company and address in addition to their first name, family name, and/or phone number. You can populate the **Company** field based on data from the customer card in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

|Priority|Field in the customer card|Description|
|------|------|-----------|
|1|**Name**|Highest priority, if the **Name Source** field in the **Shopify Shop Card** contains *Company Name*.|
|2|**Name 2**|Lowest priority, if the **Name 2 Source** field in the **Shopify Shop Card** contains *Company Name*.|

For addresses where the county/province is used, select **Code** or **Name** in the **County Source** field on the **Shopify Shop Card** page. The code or name specifies the type of data stored in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] in the **County** field. Remember to initialize customer templates per country/region so that the county code/name mapping is ready. 

## Export DTC customers to Shopify

### Initial sync of customers from Business Central to Shopify

1. Go to the search ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Customers**, and choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Add Customer** action.
3. In the **Shop Code** field, enter the code. If you open the **Shopify Customers** window from the **Shop Card** page, the shop code is populated automatically.
4. Define filters on customers as required. For example, you can filter by Country/Region code.
5. Choose **OK**.

The resulting customers are automatically created in Shopify with addresses.

> [!NOTE]  
> The initial sync of customers from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to Shopify doesn't consider the **Can Update Shopify Customers** settings.

### Sync customers

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify shop**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the specific shop for which you want to synchronize customers.
3. Choose the **Sync Customers** action.

Alternatively, use the **Start Customer Sync** action on the **Shopify Customers** window or search for the **Sync Customers** batch job.

You can schedule the task to be performed in an automated manner. Learn more at [Schedule recurring tasks](background.md#to-schedule-recurring-tasks).

## B2B Companies

If you use B2B in Shopify, you can create companies in addition to customers. You can link one or more individual customers to a company.

### Important settings when importing B2B companies from Shopify

The Shopify Connector imports all company locations, including payment terms and tax IDs, which it can use for automatic entity mapping. The information is available on the **Shopify Locations** page, which you open the page from the **Shopify Companies** and **Shopify Company Card** pages. The first imported location is used to create the customer and add address information and other fields on the **Customer Card** page. This location is marked as the **Default**. 

When you import a Shopify company, you can see associated payment terms for each company location. If the Shopify Connector is configured to update the customer, it uses the payment term from the default location. It's important that the corresponding record exists on the **Shopify Payment Terms Mapping** page.

Whether you import companies from Shopify in bulk or when you import orders, use the settings in the following table to manage the process.

|Field|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Company Import from Shopify**|Select **All Companies** if you plan to import customers from Shopify in bulk, either manually using the **Sync Companies** action or via the job queue for recurring updates. Regardless of the selection, the customer information is always imported together with the order. However, the use of this information depends on the **Shopify Company Templates** and settings in the **Company Mapping Type** field.|
|**Company Mapping Type**|Define how you want the connector to do the mapping.</br></br>- **By Email/Phone** if you want the connector to map the imported Shopify companies to an existing customer in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] using the main contact's email and phone number.</br></br>- Select **Always Take the Default Company** if you want to use the company in the **Default Company No.** field. </br></br>- Select **By Tax ID** if you want the connector to use tax details to map the imported Shopify companies to an existing customer in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. Use the **Company Tax ID Mapping** field to specify where to store tax details. |
|**Company Tax ID Mapping**| Specifies whether to store company tax details in the **Registration Number** or the **VAT Registration No.** field.|
|**Shopify Can Update Company**| Select this field if you want the connector to update the customers it finds when the **By Email/Phone** option is selected in the **Company Mapping Type** field.|
|**Auto Create Unknown Companies**| Select this field if you want the connector to create new customers when the **By Email/Phone** option is selected in the **Company Mapping Type** field. A new customer is created using the imported data and the **Customer/Company Template Code** defined on the **Shopify Shop Card** or **Shopify Customer Template** pages.|
|**Customer/Company Template Code**|Use this field together with **Auto Create Unknown Company**.</br></br>- Choose the default template to use for automatically created customers. Make sure the mandatory fields are filled in on the template, such as the **Gen. Business Posting Group**, **Customer Posting Group**, **Value-added tax (VAT)** or other tax-related fields.</br></br>- You can define templates per country/region on the **Shopify Customer Templates** page, which is useful for proper tax calculation.</br></br>Learn more at [Set up Taxes](setup-taxes.md).|

> [!NOTE]  
> The company must have a main contact. Otherwise, the connector skips to company.
> The oldest location is used as source of information when creating or updating the customer in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].
> Only the main contact is imported.

### Important settings when exporting B2B companies to Shopify

You can export existing customers to Shopify in bulk as a company. In each case, a company and one default location are created and one main contact. It's also possible to create a catalog.

When you export a customer as a Shopify company, the **Company ID** field is filled in with the value in the **No.** field from the **Customer Card** page, which helps traceability. Also, the connector fills in the **Company/Attention** field on the new company location with the company name. The name is used on imported orders.

|Field|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Can update Shopify Companies**| Enable this option if you want to generate updates later from Business Central for companies that already exist in Shopify.|
|**Default Contact Permissions**| Specify which permissions must be assigned to the main contact; you can choose between **None**, **Ordering only**, and **Location admin**.|
|**Auto Create Catalog**| Enable this option if you want to create a catalog that includes all products. A catalog is created for each exported company. When you export a customer as a Shopify company, if you configured the Shopify Connector to create a catalog, the **Customer No.** field is filled in for the catalog. This value ensures that the connector uses the specific customer to calculate prices, which eliminates the need to fill in the **Customer Price Group**, **Customer Discount Group**, and **Allow Line Discount** fields. You just need to turn on the **Sync Prices** toggle and select **Sync Prices** to start synchronizing catalog prices so that your customers get consistent pricing in Shopify and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].|
|**Company Tax ID Mapping**| Specifies if company tax details are stored in the **Registration Number** or the **VAT Registration No.** field.|

The Company Location feature in Shopify allows merchants to define default payment terms. When you export customer information as a Shopify company, payment term details transfer to Shopify and are stored in the default company location if:
* The **Payment Term** field in the **Customer Card** contains a value.
* A corresponding record is located in the **Shopify Payment Terms Mapping** page.

### Export a B2B company to Shopify

#### Initial sync of B2B companies from Business Central to Shopify

1. Go to the search ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Company**, and choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Add Company** action.
3. In the **Shop Code** field, enter the code. If you open the **Shopify Company** window from the **Shop Card** page, the shop code is populated automatically.
4. Define filters on the customer as required. For example, you can filter by Country/Region code.
5. Choose **OK**.

The resulting company and customers are automatically created in Shopify.

> [!NOTE]  
> The initial sync of companies from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to Shopify doesn't consider **Can Update Shopify Company** settings.

### Sync a B2B company

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify shop**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the specific shop for which you want to synchronize customers.
3. Choose the **Sync Company** action.

Alternatively, use the **Start Company Sync** action on the **Shopify Company** page or search for the **Sync Company** batch job.

You can schedule the task to run in an automated way. Learn more at [Schedule recurring tasks](background.md#to-schedule-recurring-tasks).

## Import and export more data using Shopify metafields

Shopify's platform includes data models for basic commerce concepts. However, commerce is diverse and often requires more complex or specific data models. The custom data platform lets you extend Shopify's data models and create your own by using metafields. Metafields are a flexible way to add and store additional information about a Shopify resource, such as a product, customer, or company. The additional information stored in metafields can be almost anything related to a resource. Some examples are preferences, credit limits, loyalty programs, social media links, or segment information.

You can import and export data stored in metafields into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. Also, there's an extensibility model that allows developers to map standard or custom fields, attributes, or other related entries in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to metafields in Shopify.

You can edit metafields on the **Shopify Metafields** page, which you open from the **Shopify Customers**, **Shopify Customer Card**, **Shopify Companies**, or **Shopify Company Card** pages.

> [!NOTE]
> You can edit the **Shopify Metafields** page in the following cases:
>
> * For a Shopify customer, if the **Customer Import from Shopify** field is set to **None** or **With Order Import**, and the **Can Update Shopify Customers** toggle is turned on.
> * For a Shopify company, if the **Company  Import from Shopify** field is set to **None** or **With Order Import**, and the **Can Update Shopify Companies** toggle is turned on.
>
> When you add a new record, the connector immediately sends a request to Shopify and stores the entry only when it gets a response with the Shopify ID for the metafield. You can't edit types that have AssistEdit functionality defined directly on the line.

If standard metafields are defined, you can use the **Get Metafield Definitions** action to get the list from Shopify. All supported metafields are imported. You only need to update the values.

# Run tasks in the background

It's efficient to run some tasks simultaneously and in an automated manner. You can perform such tasks in the background and can also set a schedule when you want those tasks to run automatically. To run tasks in the background, two modes are supported:

- Manually triggered tasks are scheduled immediately via **Job Queue Entries**.
- Recurring tasks are scheduled in **Job Queue Entries**.

## Run tasks in the background for a specific shop

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Shop**, and choose the related link.
2. Select the shop for which you want to run synchronization in the background to open the **Shopify Shop Card** page.
3. Turn on the **Allow Background Syncs** toggle.

Now, when the sync action starts, instead of running a task in the foreground it asks you to wait. When it completes, you can proceed to the next action. The task is created as a **Job Queue Entry** and starts immediately.

## To schedule recurring tasks

You can schedule the following recurring activities to be performed in an automated manner. Learn more about scheduling tasks at [Job Queue](../admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

|Task|Object|
|------|------------|

> [!NOTE]
> Some elements might be updated by several tasks. For example, when you import orders, depending on the setting on the **Shopify Shop Card** page, the system may also import and update customer and/or product data. To avoid conflicts, remember to use the same job queue category.
>
> Use the **Report Request Page** action to define filters. For example, you can specify that you import orders only when their status is **Fully Paid**.

Other tasks that can be helpful to automate further processing of sales documents:

- Report 297 Batch Post Sales Invoices
- Report 296 Batch Post Sales Orders

You can use the **Shopify Order No.** field to identify sales documents that were imported from Shopify.

To learn more about posting sales orders in a batch, go to [To create a job queue entry for batch posting of sales orders](../ui-batch-posting.md#to-create-a-job-queue-entry-for-batch-posting-of-sales-orders).

## To check the status of synchronization

On the **Business Manager** Role Center, the **Shopify Activities** part offers several cues that can help you quickly identify whether there are issues with Shopify Connector.

- **Unmapped Customers**: Shopify customer is imported, but isn't linked to a corresponding customer entry in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].
- **Unmapped Companies**: Shopify company (B2B) is imported, but isn't linked to a corresponding customer entry in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].
- **Unmapped Products** - Shopify product is imported, but isn't linked to a corresponding item entry in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].
- **Unprocessed Orders**: Shopify orders are imported, but sales documents in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] weren't created, often because of unmapped products or customers.
- **Unprocessed Shipments**: Posted sales shipments originated from Shopify orders aren't synchronized with Shopify.
- **Shipments Errors**: Shopify Connector couldn't synchronize posted sales shipments with Shopify.
- **Synchronization Errors**: There are failed job queue entries related to synchronization with Shopify.
- **Unprocessed Order Updates**: There are shopify orders that have already been processed in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], but an edition was received from Shopify. Because changes weren't synchronized to the processed order in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], you need to update the processed documents to match the received data from Shopify. To learn more, go to [Effect of order editing](synchronize-orders.md#effect-of-order-editing).

> [!Tip]
> Use the **Set up cues** action in the **Shopify Activities** part to define thresholds for cue styles. By default, the cue displays in yellow if the count is between one and five, and in red if count is five or higher.

# Set up taxes for the Shopify connection

In this article, we'll investigate how various settings in Shopify affect the storefront prices and taxes that display to customers. We'll also cover how to configure [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to support the settings in Shopify. This article is not intended to be a comprehensive taxation guide. To learn more, contact your local tax authority or a tax professional.  

The article assumes that you are liable to pay taxes when you sell goods locally or internationally.

## If you sell domestically

After you configure your Shopify to collect taxes in your domestic country or region, you can decide how to display prices on your storefront.

You specify whether to include tax in prices by turning on or off the **All prices include tax** toggle in the [**Taxes and Duties**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/taxes) settings in your **Shopify admin**.

The toggle is typically enabled for the following countries/regions:

* Australia
* Austria
* Belgium
* Czech Republic
* Denmark
* Finland
* France
* Germany
* Iceland
* Italy
* Netherlands
* New Zealand
* Norway
* Spain
* Sweden
* Switzerland
* United Kingdom

In markets such as these, a price of 100 EUR defined on the product card already contains value-added tax (VAT). The price, including VAT, is displayed to the customer in the storefront and at checkout.  

In the USA and Canada, customers don't expect to see prices with taxes because the final tax depends on where products ship to. Tax is added at checkout, so the **All prices include tax** toggle is usually turned off. In this case, a price of $100 defined on the product card is the price without tax. At checkout, taxes are added to the price.

To support the scenario where **All prices include tax** is selected, in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], fill in the following fields on the **Shopify Shop Card** page:  

1. Turn on the **Prices including VAT** toggle.  
2. In the **VAT Business Posting Group** field, specify the posting group you use for domestic customers.

Now define item prices in the **Item Card** or **Sales Price List** fields, with or without tax. When exporting prices to Shopify, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] includes domestic taxes in the calculated price and shows that price for the product in Shopify.

> [!NOTE]
> These settings affect the export of prices. When you import orders from Shopify, the information about whether prices include tax comes directly from Shopify, which is useful when selling to different markets using the **Include or exclude tax based on your customer's country** setting in Shopify Admin.

> [!Important] 
> For merchants using the US or Canadian localizations, select **Include sales tax in product price and shipping rate** in Shopify Admin. If enabled, you can't convert imported orders into sales documents because [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support backward sales tax calculation.
>
> If this field is selected and you don't charge taxes, you can manually turn off the **VAT (Tax) Included** field on the **Shopify Order** page and proceed.
>
> To simplify troubleshooting, you can inspect tax lines from the **Shopify Order** page.

## If you sell internationally

This section explores settings for scenarios where you're required to collect taxes when selling to another country/region, such as other countries/regions in the EU.

Currently, the Shopify connector only lets you export one price. Shopify automatically applies local taxes, currencies, and rounding. The **All prices include tax** toggle results in the actions described in the following subsections.

### All prices include tax is selected

|-|Domestic sales|Foreign country/region where you're collecting taxes|Foreign country/region where you're not collecting taxes|
|------------------------|--------|--------|--------|
|Price displayed in the storefront|1200|1200|1200|
|Tax rate percentage|20|25|0|
|Price at checkout|1200|1200|1200|

The price for the customer stays intact, regardless of their location, but your margin is affected due to differing tax rates per country/region.

### All prices include tax is not selected

|-|Domestic sales|Foreign country where you're collecting taxes|Foreign country where you're not collecting taxes|
|------------------------|--------|--------|--------|
|Price displayed in the storefront|1000|1000|1000|
|Tax rate percentage|20|25|0|
|Price at checkout|1200|1250|1000|

Shopify adds local taxes to the price defined on the product card based on where goods are shipped to.

## Dynamic tax-inclusive pricing

Countries/regions have different requirements for including tax in prices. If you want prices to automatically include tax, you can turn on [Dynamic tax-inclusive pricing](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/markets/pricing/dynamic-tax-inclusive-pricing) in Shopify.

In your **Shopify admin**, select **Include or exclude tax based on your customer's country** in the **Other Markets - Preferences** section of the [**Markets**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/markets) settings.  

> [!NOTE]
> This setting doesn't affect prices in domestic markets, which is controlled by the **All prices include tax** toggle.

### All prices include tax is selected

|-|Domestic sales|Foreign country/region where tax is included in price|Foreign country/region where tax is excluded|
|------------------------|---------------|---------------|--------|
|Price displayed in the storefront|1200|1250|1000|
|Tax rate percentage|20|25|10|
|Price at checkout|1200|1250|1100|

The price for each customer changes, depending on their location.

### All prices include tax is not selected

|-|Domestic sales|Foreign country/region where tax is included in price|Foreign country/region, where tax is excluded|
|------------------------|--------|--------|--------|
|Price displayed in the storefront|1000|1250|1000|
|Tax rate percentage|20|25|10|
|Price at checkout|1200|1250|1100|

> [!NOTE]
> The **All prices include tax** toggle doesn't change how prices display to international customers.

## If you sell to EU customers

Different EU countries/regions have different local tax rates. However, if you're located in the EU and sell to other EU countries/regions, you can use your local tax rate in some cases.  

In your **Shopify admin**, check the **Collect VAT** checkbox in the **European Union** section of the [**Taxes and Duties**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/taxes) settings.

|Collect VAT|VAT rate|
|-|-|
|Micro-business exemption|Use your domestic tax rate for all sales inside the EU|
|One-stop shop or specific country/region registration|Use the VAT rate of your customer's country/region|

### Collect VAT set to one-stop shop registration

In the following example, the **All prices include tax** toggle is turned on. The price on the product card is set to *1200*.

|-|Domestic sales|Foreign country/region|
|------------------------|--------|--------|
|Price displayed in the storefront|1200|1250|
|Tax rate percentage|20|25|
|Price at checkout|1200|1250|

Shopify uses the tax rate in the foreign country/region when it calculates final prices.

### Collect VAT set to micro-business exemption

In the following example, the **All prices include tax** toggle is turned on. The price on the product card is set to *1200*.

|-|Domestic sales|Foreign country/region with local tax rate of 25 percent.|
|------------------------|--------|--------|
|Price displayed in the storefront|1200|1200|
|Tax rate percentage|20|20|
|Price at checkout|1200|1200|

Shopify uses the domestic tax rate and ignores the tax rate in the foreign country/region when it calculates final prices.

## Importing Shopify orders sold to international customers

If you're collecting taxes from multiple countries/regions, you must define a specific country/regional setting in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. There's a reason why this setting is required. When a sales document is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] calculates taxes instead of reusing the taxes imported from Shopify.

You specify country/region-specific settings on the **Shopify Customer Template** page. You can define the **Default Customer No.** or **Customer Template No.**. In either case, ensure the customer or template has the following fields filled in:

1. **General Business Posting Group** (used for foreign customers).
2. **VAT Business Posting Group** (used for foreign customers).
3. **Prices including VAT** (aligned with setting on the Shopify side):

* Choose **Yes** if **All prices include tax** is enabled and **Include or exclude tax based on your customer's country** is disabled.
* Choose **No** if **All prices include tax** is disabled and **Include or exclude tax based on your customer's country** is disabled.
* Choose **Yes** if **Include or exclude tax based on your customer's country** is enabled and the country or region is listed in the [Tax-inclusive countries/regions](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/markets/pricing/dynamic-tax-inclusive-pricing#tax-inclusive-versus-tax-exclusive-countries-and-regions).
* Choose **No** if **Include or exclude tax based on your customer's country** is enabled and the country/region isn't listed in [Tax-inclusive countries/regions](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/markets/pricing/dynamic-tax-inclusive-pricing#tax-inclusive-versus-tax-exclusive-countries-and-regions).

> [!NOTE]
> The setting of the **Prices including VAT** field comes from the template, not from the specific customer. It's important to define the customer template.

## Other tax remarks

While the imported Shopify order contains information about taxes, the taxes get recalculated when you create the sales document. That recalculation means it's important that VAT/tax settings are correct in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

* Multiple product tax or VAT rates. For example, some product categories are eligible for reduced tax rates. You can use the [tax override](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/taxes/tax-overrides#create-a-manual-collection-for-products-that-need-a-tax-override) feature in Shopify. When you import and create items [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], they use the tax setup specified on the item template code in the Shopify shop. Before you import orders with such items, update the VAT product posting group.  
* Address-dependent tax rates. Use the **Tax Area Priority** field together with **Customer Templates** table to overwrite standard logic that fills in the **Tax Area Code** in the sales document. The **Tax Area Priority** field specifies the priority regarding where the function should take the information about the country or region and state or province. Then the corresponding record in the Shopify customer templates is identified, and the **Tax Area Code**, **Tax Liable**, and **VAT Bus. Posting Group** are used when a sales document is created.

# Create and Set up a Shopify Account



If you're considering whether to use Shopify as your e-Commerce solution and need a Shopify account to validate integrated workflow, you have the following options:

- Get a trial version. This is the typical starting point for end-users.  
- Create development stores. This approach is for partners who do recurring demos, trainings, and provide support.

## Trial (End-User)

Go to the [Shopify website](https://www.shopify.com) and use your email account for the administrator account to sign up for a free trial. Learn more about how to create and personalize your online store at the [Shopify Help Center](https://help.shopify.com/).

In the **Shopify Admin** of the created shop, apply the following **Settings**:

- Select a plan in the [**Plan**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/plan) settings to be able test the checkout process.

- Consider enabling the *Show login link in the header of onilne store and checkout* in the **Accounts in online store and checkout** section of the [**Customer accounts**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/customer_accounts) settings in your **Shopify admin**.
- Consider selecting *New customer account* in the  **Accounts in online store and checkout** section of the Customer accounts settings.
- Consider enabling *Self-serve returns* in the **New customer accounts** section of the Customer accounts settings.

- Activate test payments. You have two options. Start by going to [**Payments**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/payments) settings:  
  1. *(for testing) Bogus Gateway*. For more information, see [Activate Bogus Gateway for testing](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/checkout-settings/test-orders#place-a-test-order-by-simulating-a-transaction).
  2. *Shopify payments* in test mode. For more information, see [Testing Shopify Payments](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/shopify-payments/testing-shopify-payments).

- Deactivate **Automatically archive the order** in the **Order Processing** section of the [**General**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/general) settings in your **Shopify admin**.
- Consider selecting the *Company name - Optional* option in the **Customer information** section of the checkout settings.
- Enable the **Show tipping options at checkout** option in the **Tipping** section of the checkout settings, if you plan to demonstrate tipping.

> [!Important]  
> To avoid payments, remember to cancel your Shopify trial.

## Development store

Begin by joining the [Shopify Partner Program](https://help.shopify.com/partners/about). Afterwards, use the **Partner Dashboard** to create the development store. Learn more at [Creating development stores](https://help.shopify.com/partners/dashboard/managing-stores/development-stores).

After creating the store, in the **Shopify Admin** of the created shop, apply the following **Settings**:

- Consider enabling the *Show login link in the header of onilne store and checkout* in the **Accounts in online store and checkout** section of the [**Customer accounts**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/customer_accounts) settings in your **Shopify admin**.
- Consider selecting *New customer account* in the  **Accounts in online store and checkout** section of the Customer accounts settings.
- Consider enabling *Self-serve returns* in the **New customer accounts** section of the Customer accounts settings.
  
- Activate test payments. You have two options. Start by navigating to [**Payments**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/payments) settings:  
  1. *(for testing) Bogus Gateway*. For more information, see [Activate Bogus Gateway for testing](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/checkout-settings/test-orders#place-a-test-order-by-simulating-a-transaction).
  2. *Shopify payments* in test mode. Learn more at [Testing Shopify Payments](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/shopify-payments/testing-shopify-payments).
     
- Deactivate **Automatically archive the order** in the **Order Processing** section of the [**General**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/general) settings in your **Shopify admin**.
- Consider selecting the *Company name - Optional* option in the **Customer information** section of the checkout settings.
- If you plan to demonstrate tipping, enable the **Show tipping options at checkout** option in the **Tipping** section of the checkout settings.


> [!Note]  
> Development stores are usually password protected. When you try to open a specific page in your online store from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], for example to go to a specific product or order, you'll need to enter your password. While you're testing, to avoid having to enter your password, sign in to your Shopify admin and open your store from there. You won't need to enter the store password until you close your browser or your session expires.

# FAQ for technical details

This article answers frequently asked questions about the Shopify Connector.

## Which Microsoft products work with the Shopify Connector?

The connector is available only for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online. The connector is preinstalled for new environments. Organizations with existing environments can download and install the connector from AppSource. The organization must have both a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] license and a Shopify license to use the connector. To learn more about supported countries/regions, languages, and editions of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], go to [Shopify Connector on the AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2196238).

It isn't available for on-premises deployments.

The Shopify connector doesn't work for [Embed App](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/embed-app-overview), where the client URL has the `https://[application name].bc.dynamics.com` format.

The Shopify connector doesn't work with other Dynamics 365 applications, like Dynamics 365 Sales or Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.

## What support is offered for the Shopify Connector?

To learn more, go to [Support for the Shopify Connector](shopify-support.md).

## Currently unsupported features; however, we're tracking them and may consider adding them

- Markets
  - Prices per country/region. One price list is available for the selected currency. Shopify handles the conversion to other currencies.
- Draft orders

## Is the Shopify Connector extensible?

The Shopify Connector offers a few points of extensibility. We're keeping the number of points to a minimum so that we can follow the rapid development on the Shopify side without introducing breaking changes. However, the most important scenarios are covered. To learn more and explore some examples, go to [Extend the Shopify Connector](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-extending-shopify).
Instead of building every modification as an extension, we suggest that you investigate whether you can contribute code to the Shopify Connector through a codevelopment process with Microsoft.

## Is the Shopify Connector open for contribution?

This extension is open for contributions from our community. You can find the [source code](https://github.com/microsoft/ALAppExtensions/tree/main/Apps/W1/Shopify) in the Microsoft AL application add-ons repository.

## Building your version of the Shopify Connector

According to Shopify, if you want to build and publish a connector app on Shopify marketplace that has the primary purpose of transferring or sharing merchant data to a third party ([!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]), you must have written consent from Shopify. As part of this process, you must get consent from Microsoft in the "End Recipient Data Acknowledgement Form". We need to ask you to handle the matter with Shopify because Microsoft can't sign third-party agreements.

### What to do

Check the Shopify requirements because you still might be able to have an unlisted app.

Alternatively, the Shopify Connector for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] constantly gets new features and new customers. If you discover a specific gap, consider [submitting a product suggestion](https://aka.ms/bcideas) or a code contribution to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. For requirements that might not be relevant for a majority of customers, and can't be easily addressed by the current extensibility model, please reach out to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] development team to discuss the use case. We should be able to find a feasible solution.

# Transactions and payouts

When a customer completes their checkout in the online store, the information about payments is saved as a **Transaction**. There might be multiple transactions linked to the order, such as when a customer uses a gift card to pay some of the cost and then uses a credit card or PayPal for the remaining amount.

If you use Shopify Payment as a payment provider, you can also see payouts from Shopify to your bank account. The payouts are in addition to information about money received from the customer.

## Transactions

The payment transactions that take place in Shopify are synchronized with the orders and can be viewed on the **Shopify Orders** page.

To review all transactions, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transactions**, and select the related link.

The **Posted Invoice No.** field can be helpful in the reconciliation process.

If you configured a payment method mapping, the created sales document is assigned a **Payment Method Code**. Learn more at [Payment Method Mapping](#payment-method-mapping).

## Payouts

If your store uses Shopify Payment, you receive payments through **Shopify Payouts** when a customer pays using Shopify Payments and accelerated checkouts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Shops**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the shop for which you want to synchronize payouts to open the **Shopify Shop Card** page.
3. Choose the **Sync Payouts** action.

To review all payouts, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payouts**, and select the related link.

**Payouts** are for information purposes only and don't affect the General Ledger or Bank Ledger, though they can be helpful when you process your bank account statement.

## Payment method mapping

To fill in the **Payment method code** for sales documents imported from Shopify automatically, you need to configure **Payment method mapping**.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Shops**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the shop for which you want to define a mapping to open the **Shopify Shop Card** page.
3. Choose the **Payment Method Mapping** action.
4. In the **Gateway** and **Credit Card Company** fields, enter the name of the payment method from Shopify. The record gets created automatically when you import Shopify orders.
5. Enter the **Payment Method Code** with the corresponding payment method in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]  
> If the corresponding payment method in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] has **Bal. Account Type** and **Bal. Account No.** populated, then during posting the invoice system will create a balancing entry of the *Payment* type and apply it to the *Invoice* type in the customer ledger entry.

## Basic use case
  
Parties:

* Buyer - person who buys goods from Shopify online store.
* Merchant - your company.
* Payment provider - company that facilitates payment processing for you. Can be Shopify Payments or a third party.

### How money flows

The Buyer buys goods in online store. The last stage is to process payment.

>[!NOTE]
> This example doesn't cover cases when payment is completed outside Shopify checkout, which is valid for B2B scenarios.
  
The Buyer pays with a credit card, PayPal, or a local payment method like MobilePay in Denmark. The Payment Provider takes the full amount from the Buyer. The Buyers' money moves to the Payment Provider.

Depending on the Payment Provider, the Merchant might see this money in their account with the Payment Provider, including received amounts and deducted commissions. Payment providers often take a commission from each transaction, and in some cases they can have a fixed fee as well.
  
Depending on the Payment provider, the Merchant either triggers a transfer of the money to their Bank Account (payout) manually or that happens automatically within a defined period - once per day, once per month, and so on.
  
Depending on the bank, the Merchant can see this incoming transaction at their bank account via online banking or in the bank statement.

There are several options on how to handle payment transactions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]
  
### Option 1: reconcile incoming transfers to bank account against original invoices
  
Merchant imports sales order to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] and post shipment and invoice.

Result: system creates a **Customer Ledger Entry** of type **Invoice** with the full amount, **Open** is set to Yes. The **Remaining Amount** is equal to the invoiced amount.

Merchant imports bank statement using payment reconciliation journal.

Issues:

1. You might have difficulty if there are multiple invoices (and credit memos), but one lump sum payout from the Payment Provider.
2. Amount usually doesn't match due to commission. You can use payment tolerance or/and payment discounts to handle fees.

### Option 2: reconcile incoming transfers to bank account against interim account representing money at the payment provider
  
Merchant imports sales order to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] and post shipment and invoice.
  
Result: system creates a customer ledger entry of the type **Invoice** with the full amount, and **Open** is set to Yes. The **Remaining Amount** is equal to the invoiced amount.

However, because the sales order has a payment method code where the **Bal. Account Type** and  **Bal. Account No.** fields are filled in, the system automatically creates another customer ledger entry of the type **Payment** and applies it to the customer ledger entry created earlier.

>[!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] fills in the **Payment Method Code** field based on the payment method mapping. Learn more at [Payment Method Mapping](#payment-method-mapping).
  
You can define balancing accounts for payment methods in two ways:

* **Bal. Account Type** set as **Bank**, and **Bal Account No.** 

   Fill in the special bank account that represents your account at the payment provider.
* **Bal. Account Type** set as **G/L Account** and **Bal Account No.** 
   Fill in the G/L account that represents your account at the payment provider.

It makes sense to use a bank account if the payment provider exports some kind of account statement, which you can import into the payment reconciliation journal.

The merchant imports bank statement using payment reconciliation journal. The incoming payout can be processed:

* As a transfer from another bank. If the transfer takes a few days or involves currency exchange, you might want to use an interim G/L account.
* As a difference on the G/L account that represents your account at the payment provider.
  
The remaining balance on the G/L or bank account that represents your account at the payment provider can be written off as "Fees/Commissions"

Issues:

1. You can create multiple G/L or bank accounts if you're dealing with multiple payment providers. However, sales orders in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] support only one payment method code, which makes it difficult to handle cases when a buyer uses multiple payment methods for an order.

## Reconcile payments in Shopify with invoices

When a customer completes their checkout in the online store, the information about their payment is saved as a Transaction. There can be multiple transactions linked to an order. For example, a customer might use a gift card to pay some of the cost and then use a credit card or PayPal for the remaining amount. The gift card scenario is probably the most common, but there are also store credits, which were recently added to the Shopify admin.

### Sample scenario

This sample scenario involves the following parties:

* The Buyer, who is the person who buys goods from your Shopify online store.
* The Merchant, which is your company.
* The Payment Provider, which is the company that facilitates payment processing for you. The provider can be Shopify Payments or a third party.

### How the money flows

The Buyer buys goods from an online store. The last stage is to process their payment.

The Buyer pays part of the amount with a gift card (or store credit), and the remaining amount with a credit card, PayPal, or a local payment method such as MobilePay in Denmark.

The Merchant can access the issued gift card and information about its use in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

Depending on the Payment Provider, the Merchant might see the money in their account with the Payment Provider, including both the amount received and the amount deducted for the provider's commissions. Payment providers often take a commission from each transaction, and in some cases they also have a fixed fee.

Depending on the Payment Provider, the Merchant either transfers the money to their bank account (payout) manually or automatically within a defined period. For example, one time per day, per month, and so on.

Depending on the Bank, the Merchant can access the incoming transaction in their bank account via online banking or their bank statement.

### Reconcile transactions and bank statements

The Merchant imports a sales order to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] and posts the shipment and invoice. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] creates a customer ledger entry of the type **Invoice** with the full amount, and sets **Open** to **Yes**. The remaining amount equals the invoiced amount.

The Merchant processes the imported Shopify transactions in the **Transactions** list. They apply filters, and then use the **Suggest Shopify Payments** action to transfer the transactions to the general journal. Alternatively, the Merchant can use the **Suggest Shopify Payments** action on the **Cash Receipt Journal** page.

The Merchant reviews the lines, and notices that the applied documents are selected automatically. They post the journal, and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] creates a customer ledger entry of the type **Payment** and applies it to the corresponding entry of the type **Invoice**.

> [!NOTE] 
> If you configured a payment method mapping, make sure the payment method doesn't have the **Bal. Account Type** and **Bal. Account No.** fields filled in. If they are, when you post the invoice [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] creates a balancing entry of the **Payment** type and applies it to the **Invoice** type on the customer ledger entry. You can't create a journal line and apply it to the sales invoice.
>
> Instead, create a **Journal Batch** for each payment method, and fill in the **Bal. Account Type** and **Bal. Account No.** fields.

The Merchant imports their bank statement using a payment reconciliation journal or bank reconciliation journal with one or more transactions that represent the transfer from the Payment Provider to the bank account.

### Handle currency

The Shopify connector imports orders and transactions in **Shop Currency**. If you configure Shopify to use different currencies based on country, that might lead to some differences. For example, in a store where the local currency is Danish Krone (DKK), an order for a German customer totaling 13.95 EUR converts to 409.53 DKK in sales. However, the payment transaction shows 409.48 DKK.

# Troubleshooting the Shopify and Business Central synchronization

You might run into situations where you need to troubleshoot issues when synchronizing data between Shopify and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. This page defines troubleshooting steps for some typical scenarios.

## Run tasks in the foreground

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Shop**, and choose the related link.
2. Select the shop for which you want to troubleshoot to open the **Shopify Shop Card** page.
3. Turn off the **Allow Background Syncs** toggle.

Now, when the sync action is triggered, the task runs in the foreground. If an error occurs, you get an error dialog with a **Copy details** link. Use the link to copy information to a text editor for further analysis.

## Logs

The logging features can make it easier to identify why an error occurred. On the **Shopify Shop Card** page, in the **Logging Mode** field, you can specify the level of detail you want to capture about errors. The field provides the following options:

- **Disabled** - Don't log information about errors.
- **Error Only** - Log only the error message, without the request/response pairs. This setting is the default for new shops.
- **All** - Log the request/response pairs for all transactions, including successful pairs. Logging all errors continuously can slow down [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. Use this mode when the data exchange doesn't result in error, but you want insights about the data that was sent and received. Some data is always logged, regardless of whether logging is turned on. For more information, see [Data capture](#data-capture).

### To review logs

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Log Entries**, and choose the related link.
2. Select the related log entry, and then open the **Shopify Log Entry** page.
3. Review the request, status code and description, and response values.

> [!TIP]
> If you must contact Shopify support for help with troubleshooting, note the information in the **Request ID** field. That information can help support resolve the issue more quickly.

You can download the request and response values as files in a text format.

### Manage log entry data

To help keep the size of your database under control, log entries are included in a data retention policy named **Shpfy Log Entry**. Retention policies let you specify how long you want to store different types of data. By default, Shopify log entries are kept for one month. To learn more about retention policies, go to [Define Retention Policies](../admin-data-retention-policies.md).

Also, on the **Shopify Log Entries** page, you can delete all log entries, or just the entries that are older than seven days.

## Troubleshoot export issues

When you export data to Shopify, the Shopify Connector skips records that Shopify will reject or that aren't valid for export for other reasons. While the behavior is expected, you might be confused if some information wasn't processed as you expected. You can find those entries on the **Shopify Skipped Records** page, which shows all skipped records and provides the reasons and the date and time the records were skipped.

The **Logging Mode** field controls the content of the **Shopify Skipped Records** page.

> [!NOTE]
> The **All** option works in the same way as **Error Only** and logs only skipped entries. It won't log entries that were previously skipped.

Over time, the number of records on the Shopify Skipped Records pageTo help you keep the size of your database under control, you can use a retention policy. To learn more about retention policies, go to [Define Retention Policies](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-data-retention-policies).

### Cases that the Shopify Connector logs

Customer:

- A customer has an empty email.
- A customer with the same email or phone number exists.

Posted sales invoice:

- Customer doesn't exist in Shopify.
- Payment term mapping is missing.
- Customer number is the default customer number for the Shopify Shop.
- Customer number is used in the Shopify customer template.
- No lines exist in the sales invoice.
- Invalid (negative or fractional) quantity.
- Empty number value.

Product:

- Item is blocked/sales blocked (item variant).
- Item is blocked.
- Item description is empty.

Catalog:

- Price sync if the catalog isn't found in Shopify.

Shipments:

- Related Shopify order doesn't exist.
- No lines in the posted sales shipment are applicable for fulfillment.
- No corresponding fulfillment is found in Shopify.

If you run sync in the foreground you will get a notification if records were skipped. Choose **View Skipped Records** to open the **Shopify Skipped Records** page.

## Data capture

Regardless of whether logging is turned on, some Shopify responses are always logged. You can inspect or download the logs from the **Data Capture List** page.

Choose the **Retrieved Shopify Data** action on one of the following pages:

- **Shopify order**
- **Shopify order line**
- **Shopify fulfillments**
- **Shopify order shipping costs**
- **Shopify order transactions**
- **Shopify return**
- **Shopify return line**
- **Shopify refund**
- **Shopify refund line**
- **Shopify payouts**
- **Shopify payment transactions**
- **Shopify transactions**

## Reset sync

For optimal performance, the connector imports only customers, products, and orders that were created or changed after the last synchronization. On the **Shopify Shop Card** page, there are functions that change the date/time of the last synchronization, or completely reset it. This function ensures that all data synchronizes, rather than just the changes since the last sync.

This function only applies to syncs from Shopify to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. It can be useful if you need to restore deleted data such as products, customers, or deleted orders.

## Request the access token

If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't connect to your Shopify account, request the access token from Shopify. You might need to request a new token if there were changes to the security keys or required permissions (application scopes).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify shops**, and choose the related link.
2. Select the shop for which you want to get the access token to open the **Shopify Shop Card** page.
3. Choose the **Request Access** action.
4. If prompted, sign in to your Shopify account.

The **Has AccessKey** toggle is turned on.

## Verify and enable permissions to make HTTP requests in a nonproduction environment

To work correctly, the Shopify Connector extension requires permission to make HTTP requests. HTTP requests are prohibited for all extensions when you run tests in sandbox environments.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Extension Management**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the **Shopify Connector** extension.
3. Choose the **Configure** action to open the **Extension Setting** page.
4. Make sure that the **Allow HTTPClient Requests** toggle is enabled.

## Rotate the Shopify access token

The following procedures describe how to rotate the access token used by the Shopify connector to access your Shopify online shop.

### In Shopify

1. From your **Shopify Admin**, go to [Apps](https://www.shopify.com/admin/apps).
2. Select **Delete** in the row with the **Dynamics 365 Business Central** app.
3. Select **Delete** in the message that appears.

### In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify shops**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the shop for which you want to rotate the access token to open the **Shopify Shop Card** page.
3. Choose the **Request Access** action.
4. If prompted, sign in to your Shopify account, review privacy and permissions, and then choose the **Install App** button.

## Known issues

### Error: The Sales Header does not exist. Identification fields and values: Document Type='Quote',No.='YOUR SHOPIFY STORE'

To calculate prices, the Shopify Connector creates a temporary sales document (quote) for a temporary customer (Shop Code) and uses the standard price calculation logic. If a partner extension subscribes to events on a temporary sales document, the header might not be available. We recommend that you contact the extension provider. Ask them to modify their code to check for temporary records. In some cases, they just need to add the `IsTemporary` method in the right place. To learn more about `IsTemporary`, go to [IsTemporary](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods-auto/record/record-istemporary-method).

To verify that the problem is caused by a partner extension, use the **Copy information to clipboard** link in the error message and copy the content to a text editor. The information contains an **AL call stack**, where the top line is the line where the error occurred. The following example shows an AL call stack.

AL call stack:

```AL
[Object Name]([Object type] [Object Id]).[Function Name] line [XX] - [Extension Name] by [Publisher] 
...
"Sales Line"(Table 37)."No. - OnValidate"(Trigger) line 98 - Base Application by Microsoft
"Shpfy Product Price Calc."(CodeUnit 30182).CalcPrice line 20 - Shopify Connector by Microsoft
"Shpfy Create Product"(CodeUnit 30174).CreateTempProduct line 137 - Shopify Connector by Microsoft
"Shpfy Create Product"(CodeUnit 30174).CreateProduct line 5 - Shopify Connector by Microsoft
"Shpfy Create Product"(CodeUnit 30174).OnRun(Trigger) line 12 - Shopify Connector by Microsoft
"Shpfy Add Item to Shopify"(Report 30106)."Item - OnAfterGetRecord"(Trigger) line 2 - Shopify Connector by Microsoft
"Shpfy Products"(Page 30126)."AddItems - OnAction"(Trigger) line 5 - Shopify Connector by Microsoft
```

Remember to share the AL call stack information with the supplier of the extension.

### Error: Gen. Bus. Posting Group must have a value in Customer: 'YOUR SHOPIFY STORE'. It cannot be zero or empty

On the **Shopify Shop Card** page, in the **Customer Template Code** field, choose the template that has **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** populated. The customer template is used to create customers and to calculate sales prices on sales documents.

### Error: Importing data to your Shopify shop isn't enabled. Go to the shop card to enable it

On the **Shopify Shop Card** page, turn on the **Allow Data Sync to Shopify** toggle. This setting helps protect the online shop from getting demo data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

### Error: Oauth error invalid_request: Could not find Shopify API application with api_key

The [Embed App](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/embed-app-overview) might use the client URL with the format: `https://[application name].bc.dynamics.com`. The Shopify connector doesn't work for Embed Apps. To learn more, go to [Which Microsoft products work with the Shopify Connector?](shopify-faq.md#which-microsoft-products-work-with-the-shopify-connector).

### Error: Internal Error. Looks like Something Went Wrong on Our End. Request ID: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX

Contact Microsoft support via your Business Central partner within seven days of experiencing this error, and provide the Request ID. To learn more, see [Support for the Shopify Connector](shopify-support.md).

### Error: Oauth error invalid_request: Your account does not have permission to grant the requested access for this app

The user who requested access doesn’t have the rights to manage apps (the ability to manage and install apps and channels, as well as potentially approve app charges). You might be able to resolve  issue by installing the app as the account owner. Alternatively, you can check the **App permission** for the user in the [**User and permissions**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/account) settings in your **Shopify admin**.  

### You need permissions to update Dynamics 365 Business Central. Ask the store owner to update this app. Or contact them for access to: [PERMISSION]

The updated version of the connector requires more permissions (application scopes) than the user who requested access has. You might be able to resolve this issue by installing the app as the account owner. Alternatively, you can check the **App permission** for the user in the [**User and permissions**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/account) settings in your **Shopify admin**. If the required permissions are missing, which you can see in the error message, ask the account owner to grant the required permissions.

### Error: The application scope is changed, please request a new access token for the store 'YOUR SHOPIFY STORE'

Request a new token because the updated version of the connector requires more permissions (application scopes). To learn more, go to [Request access token](#request-the-access-token).

### [{"message":"Access denied for FIELD field.","locations":[{"line":0,"column":0}],"path":["path"],"extensions":{"code":"ACCESS_DENIED","documentation":https://shopify.dev/api/usage/access-scopes}}]

Request a new token because the updated version of the connector requires more permissions (application scopes). To learn more, go to [Request access token](#request-the-access-token).

### [API] Invalid API key or access token (unrecognized login or wrong password)

Request a new token because the updated version of the connector requires more permissions (application scopes). To learn more, go to [Request access token](#request-the-access-token).

### The app couldn’t be loaded. This app can’t load due to an issue with browser cookies. Try enabling cookies in your browser, switching to another browser, or contacting the developer to get support

It seems that you tried to get an access token multiple times. Make sure that the browser allows pop-ups. If you're using a sandbox environment, [Verify and enable permissions to make HTTP requests in a nonproduction environment](#verify-and-enable-permissions-to-make-http-requests-in-a-nonproduction-environment).

# Get started with the Shopify Connector

Connect your Shopify stores with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] and maximize your business productivity. Manage and view insights from your business and your Shopify store as one unit.

To use Shopify with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], you must do a couple of things first. This article serves as a guide to integrate your Shopify store with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

## Prerequisites for Shopify

You must have:

- A Shopify account
- A Shopify online store

To learn more about how to create Shopify trials and the recommended settings, go to [Create and set up a Shopify account](shopify-account.md).

## Prerequisites for Business Central

- Make sure that the **[Shopify Connector](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2196238)** app is installed.

  The app is preinstalled for all new sign-ups and trials. Learn more about installing apps from AppSource at [Installing and Uninstalling Extensions](../ui-extensions-install-uninstall.md#install). Use the following steps if you don't have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

- Ensure that the user has the right permissions. Shopify Connector is covered by the **Shopify – Admin (SHPFY – ADMIN)** permission set. Learn more at [Create Users According to Licenses](../ui-how-users-permissions.md) and [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](../ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

## Install the Dynamics 365 Business Central app to your Shopify online store

For existing instances of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], this step is optional and can be skipped.

1. Locate the [Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://apps.shopify.com/dynamics-365-business-central) app on the [Shopify AppStore](https://apps.shopify.com/).
2. Choose the **Add App** button. Sign in to your Shopify account if prompted. Select the online shop if you have more than one.
3. After reviewing privacy and permissions, choose the **Install App** button.

   You can find and open the installed **Dynamics 365 Business Central** app in the **Apps** section on the sidebar of the **Shopify admin** page.
4. Choose **Sign up now** to start the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] trial, or **Sign in** if you already have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. You are redirected to your [Business Central](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com) page.

   > [!Note]
   > In countries where Microsoft doesn't offer built-in localization, the sign up process stop and the *[!INCLUDE[prod_long](../includes/prod_long.md)] is not available in this market* message displays. To learn more, go to [Start with the trial in location with partner-based localizations](../trial-signup.md#start-with-the-trial-in-location-with-partner-based-localizations).

6. Do the next steps in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

## Connect Business Central to the Shopify online store

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shopify Shop**, and choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter a code that is easy to find in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, the name might reflect what a shop sells, such as "Furniture" or "Coffee," or the country or region it serves.
4. In the **Shopify URL** field, enter the URL of the online shop that you're connecting. Use the following format: **https://{shop}.myshopify.com/**. You can build the URL by combining the store ID from the admin URL. For example, **admin.shopify.com/store/{shop}** and **.myshopify.com**.

   > [!TIP]
   > You can copy the URL from Shopify Admin, like **https://admin.shopify.com/store/{shop}**, and the connector converts it to the required format.

5. Turn on the **Enabled** toggle, and then review and accept the terms and conditions.
6. If prompted, sign in to your Shopify account. Review the privacy terms and permissions, and then choose the **Install App** button.

Repeat steps 2-6 for all online shops that you want to connect.

### Known issues

- The browser blocks the pop-up window. When you turn on the **Enabled** toggle, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] opens the **Waiting for a response - do not close this page** page while it waits for an access token from Shopify. If that page is closed or blocked, you can't connect to Shopify. Learn more at [Request the access token](troubleshoot.md#request-the-access-token).

## Next steps

Now your online shop is connected to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. In the next steps, you'll define how and what to synchronize.

- [Synchronize Items and Inventory](synchronize-items.md)
- [Synchronize Customers](synchronize-customers.md)
- [Synchronize Orders](synchronize-orders.md)

## Testing strategies

There are different approaches to testing an integration, and each approach has its pros and cons.

You can connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] and Shopify accounts as often as you like. The Shopify Connector affects only the environment, or to be more precise, the company where it's enabled. You can connect to the same Shopify online store from multiple environments or companies. You can disable and re-enable the connector.

It's easy to rerun synchronization tests. The connector allows you to delete imported data, such as products, customers, and orders, and then import them again. Just [reset sync](troubleshoot.md#reset-sync).

### Shopify sandbox and Business Central sandbox

This is probably the safest way to test integration. Instead of using a Shopify sandbox, you can use a trial subscription or Development Store. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], you can also use a test company in a production environment.

To learn more about [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] sandboxes, go to [Create a new environment](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-environments#create-a-new-environment).

### Shopify sandbox and Business Central production

This *isn't* a recommended configuration for testing because the Shopify Connector can create or modify items and customers. It can also create sales documents such as orders and invoices. These documents can be difficult to undo.

If you must use this configuration, we recommend that you review and probably disable the following settings:

- **Auto Create Unknown Item** to not create items.
- **Shopify can update items** to not update mapped items.
- **Auto Create Unknown Customer** to not create customers and contacts.
- **Shopify can update customers** to not update existing customers.
- **Auto Create Sales Order** to not create sales orders and sales invoices.

For more information, see [Restoring an Environment](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-backup-restore).

### Shopify production and Business Central sandbox

It might be a good idea to back up your data. For example, export your products and customers. For more information, see [Using CSV files to back up store information](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shopify-admin/duplicate-store#using-csv-files-to-back-up-store-information).

Turn off the **Allow Data Sync to Shopify** toggle so that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't write to Shopify. In this case, you can import products, images, customers, and orders from Shopify. But you can't send item, prices, inventory levels, customers, and fulfillment information to Shopify.

If you keep the **Allow Data Sync to Shopify** toggle enabled, then other protective measures are:

- Select **Draft** in the **Status for Create Product** field to ensure that exported products aren't available to buyers. You can verify how products look in the online store, and synchronize prices, options, and stock levels. Just make sure to use filters on the **Add Item to Shopify** page to limit the number of exported items.
- Turn off the **Export Customer to Shopify** toggle so that you don't send customers to Shopify.

# Set up general inventory information

You specify your general inventory setup on the **Inventory Setup** page.

## To set up general inventory information

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Inventory Setup** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### To set up inventory valuation and costing

To record inventory costs correctly, you must set up various fields and pages before you make transactions that include item. Typically, businesses choose a specific costing method and apply that to inventory items, for example, to help them track the value of items on stock.  

|**Field**|**Details**|  
|------------|-------------|
|**Automatic Cost Posting**|Ensure that the cost is automatically posted to the general ledger whenever an inventory transaction is posted. The field is turned on by default to ensure that inventory values are always correct in the general ledger. Alternatively, you can manually post costs at regular intervals with the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job. You can also turn off automatic cost posting. A notification displays from which you can start an assisted setup guide to help you schedule tasks for the job queue. To learn more, go to [Reconcile Inventory Costs with the General Ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md).|
|**Automatic Cost Adjustment**| Specifies if item value entries are automatically adjusted when an item transaction is posted. The field is set to **Always** by default to ensure that inventory values are always correct, which in turn keeps your sales and profit statistics up to date. Cost adjustment forwards cost changes from inbound entries, such as purchases or production output, to the related outbound entries, such as sales or transfers. The adjustment is helpful for new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers and small businesses with relatively low inventory transaction levels. However, as a business grows and inventory levels increase, adjustments can slow down system performance. To minimize reduced performance during posting, select a time option to define how far back in time from the work date an inbound transaction can occur to potentially trigger adjustment of related outbound value entries. Alternatively, you can manually adjust costs at regular intervals with the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. You can also set the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field to **Never**. A notification displays from which you can start an assisted setup guide to help you schedule tasks for the job queue. To learn more, go to [Adjust Item Costs](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md).|
|**Expected Cost Posting to G/L**|Ensure that you post expected costs to the general ledger. The interim G/L accounts show an estimate of the amounts due and the cost of the traded items before you invoice them. To learn more, go to [Design Details: Expected Cost Posting](design-details-expected-cost-posting.md) and [Reconcile Inventory Costs with the General Ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md).|
|**Average Cost Calc. Type**|Define if the average cost is to be calculated per item only or per item for each stockkeeping unit and for each variant of the item. To learn more, go to [Design details: average cost](design-details-average-cost.md).|
|**Average Cost Period**|Select the period of time you would like application to use for calculating the weighted average cost of items that use the average costing method. To learn more, go to [Design details: average cost](design-details-average-cost.md).|
|**Default Costing Method**|Select the default costing method that determines whether an actual or a budgeted value is capitalized and used in the cost calculation. You can select a different costing method for a specific item either by selecting item template where costing method is defined or by manually selecting a different value on the **Item Card** page. To learn more, go to [Design details: costing methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).|

To learn more about costing in general, go to [Managing Inventory Costs](finance-manage-inventory-costs.md).  

If you want to include warehouse handling times in the order promising calculation on purchase lines, you can set it up as a default for inventory on the **Inventory Setup** page, and for your location. To learn more, go to [Calculate Order Promising Dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md).  

## Allow workers to post transactions at the same time

To allow people to post inventory transactions at the same time, you can enable the **Enable multiple users to post item ledger entries and value entries at the same time** feature on the **Feature Management** page. By default, the feature isn’t enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Similar features are available for project, resource, and warehouse entries. To learn more, go to:
>
> * [Allow multiple people to post project transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-jobs.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-project-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Allow multiple people to post resource transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-resources.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-resource-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Design details: Creating warehouse entries](design-details-warehouse-entries.md)

If you enable the feature, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns entry numbers for each table from `SequenceNumbers` in the database, which allows more people to post transactions at the same time. The result can be that sometimes inventory entries from two or more transactions are interleaved. For example, an item register might contain any or all of the entry tables, as shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="media/interleaved inventory tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the item register with several entry tables." lightbox="media/interleaved inventory tables.png":::

If you don’t enable the feature, when someone posts an inventory transaction the tables are locked and other users can’t post inventory transactions. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in each table and assigns a number that’s one higher. This numbering ensures that entries that belong to the same register are consecutive, but prevents other people from posting at the same time.

> [!NOTE]
> You might not want to enable the feature if you have a feature or extension that:
>
> - Relies on consecutive entry numbers.
> - Requires that tables are locked throughout the posting process.

# Use OCR to Turn PDF and Image Files into Electronic Documents

From PDF or image files that you receive from your trading partners, you can have an external OCR service (Optical Character Recognition) generate electronic documents that can be converted to document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can [send it to the OCR service from the **Incoming Documents** page](#to-send-a-pdf-or-image-file-to-the-ocr-service-from-the-incoming-documents-page).

As an alternative to sending the file from the **Incoming Documents** page, the OCR service can offer the option to [process files forwarded to a dedicated email address](#to-send-a-pdf-or-image-file-to-the-ocr-service-by-email). Then, when you receive the electronic document back, a related incoming document record is created automatically in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

After some seconds, the OCR service will send the processed file to the **Incoming Documents** page as an electronic document record that can be [converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor](#to-receive-the-resulting-electronic-document-from-the-ocr-service), a sales invoice, credit memo or a journal entry.

Because OCR is based on optical recognition, it's likely that the OCR service will interpret characters in your PDF or image files wrongly when it first processes a certain vendor's documents, for example. It may not interpret the company logo as the vendor's name or it may misinterpret the total amount on a receipt because of its layout. To avoid these errors going forward, you can correct the errors in a separate version of the **Incoming Document** page. Then you send the corrections back to the OCR service to train it to interpret the specific characters and fields correctly next time it processes a PDF or image document for the same vendor. For more information, see [Train the OCR service to avoid errors](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md#to-train-the-ocr-service-to-avoid-errors).

The traffic of files to and from the OCR service is processed by a dedicated job queue entry. This job queue is created automatically when you enable the external OCR service connection. For more information, see [Set Up Incoming Documents](across-how-setup-income-documents.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The OCR feature is provided by external providers. Choose a service package that is appropriate for your organization and/or country/region. Find services compatible with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and details on available features at [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646).

## To send a PDF or image file to the OCR service from the Incoming Documents page

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Documents**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a new incoming document record and attach the file. For more information, see [Create Incoming Document Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).  
3. On the **Incoming Documents** page, select one or more lines, and then choose the **Send to Job Queue** action.

   The value in the **OCR Status** field changes to **Ready**. The attached PDF or image file is sent to the OCR service by the job queue according to the schedule, if no errors exist.
4. Alternatively, on the **Incoming Documents** page, select one or more lines, and then choose the **Send to OCR Service** action to immediately send the files for processing.

   The value in the **OCR Status** field changes to **Sent**, if no errors exist.

## To send a PDF or image file to the OCR service by email

From your email application, you can forward an email to the OCR service provider with the PDF or image file attached. For information about the email address to send to, see the OCR service provider's web site.

Since no incoming document record exists for the file, a new record will be created automatically on the **Incoming Documents** page when the OCR service sends the resulting electronic document. For more information, see [Create Incoming Document Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If you work on a tablet or phone, you can send the file to the OCR service as soon as you have taken a photo of the document, or you can create an incoming document directly. For more information, see [Create an incoming document record by taking a photo](across-how-create-income-document-records.md#create-an-incoming-document-record-by-taking-a-photo).

## To receive the resulting electronic document from the OCR service

The electronic document that is created by the OCR service from the PDF or image file is automatically received into the **Incoming Documents** page by the job queue entry that is set up when you enable the OCR service.

If you aren't using a job queue, or you want to receive a finished OCR document sooner than per the job queue schedule, you can choose the **Receive from OCR Service** action. This option will get any documents that are completed by the OCR service.

> [!NOTE]  
> If the OCR service is set up to require manual verification of processed documents, then the **OCR Status** field will contain **Awaiting Verification**. In that case, perform the following steps to sign in to the OCR service website to manually verify an OCR document.

1. In the **OCR Status** field, choose the **Awaiting Verification** hyperlink.
2. On the OCR service website, sign in using the credentials of your OCR service account. For more information, see [Set up an OCR service](across-how-setup-income-documents.md#to-set-up-an-ocr-service).

   Information for the OCR document is displayed, showing both the source content of the PDF or image file and the resulting OCR field values.
3. Review the field values and manually edit or enter values in fields that the OCR service has tagged as uncertain.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The OCR process is completed and the resulting electronic document is sent to the **Incoming Documents** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], according to the job queue schedule.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for any other OCR document to be verified.

Now you can proceed to create document records for the received electronic documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], manually or automatically. For more information, see the next procedure. You can also [connect the new incoming document record to existing posted or non-posted documents](across-how-connect-disconnect-income-document-records.md) so that the source file is easy to access from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## To create a purchase invoice from an electronic document received from the OCR service

The following procedure describes how to create a purchase invoice record from a vendor invoice received as an electronic document from the OCR service. The procedure is the same when you create, for example, a general journal line from an expense receipt or a sales return order from a customer.

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Description** and **No.** fields on the created document lines will only be filled if you have first mapped text found on the OCR document to the two fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can do this mapping as item references, for document lines of type Item. For more information, see [Use Item References](inventory-how-use-item-cross-refs.md). You can also use the **Text-to-Account Mapping** function. For more information, see [Map text on an incoming document to a specific vendor, G/L, or bank account](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md#to-map-text-on-an-incoming-document-to-a-specific-vendor-account).

1. Select the line for the incoming document, and then choose the **Create Document** action.

A purchase invoice will be created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on the information in the electronic vendor document that you received from the OCR service. Information will be inserted in the new purchase invoice based on the mapping that you've defined as a reference or as text-to-account mapping.

Any validation errors, typically related to wrong or missing data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], will be shown on the **Errors and Warnings** FastTab. For more information, see [Handle errors when receiving electronic documents](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md#to-handle-errors-when-receiving-electronic-documents).

### To map text on an incoming document to a specific vendor account

For incoming documents, you typically use the **Map Text to Account** action to define that a certain text on a vendor invoice received from the OCR service is mapped to a certain vendor account. Going forward, any part of the incoming document description that exists as a mapping text means that the **Vendor No.** field on resulting document or journal lines of type *G/L Account* are filled with the vendor in question.

In addition to mapping to a vendor account or G/L accounts, you can also map text to a bank account. This option is useful, for example, for electronic documents for expenses that are already paid, and for which you want to create a general journal line that is ready to post to a bank account.

1. Select the relevant incoming document line, and then choose the **Map Text to Account** action. The **Text-to-Account Mapping** page opens.
2. In the **Mapping Text** field, enter any text that occurs on vendor invoices that you want to create purchase documents or journal lines for. You can enter up to 50 characters.
3. In the **Vendor No.** field, enter the vendor that the resulting purchase document or journal line will be created for.
4. In the **Debit Acc. No.** field, enter the debit-type G/L account that will be inserted on resulting purchase document or journal line of type G/L Account.
5. In the **Credit Acc. No.** field, enter the credit-type G/L account that will be inserted on resulting purchase document or journal line of type G/L Account.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Do not use the **Bal. Source Type** and **Bal. Source No.** fields in connection with incoming documents. They are used for automatic payment reconciliation only. For more information, see [Map Text on Recurring Payments to Accounts for Automatic Reconciliation](receivables-how-map-text-recurring-payments-accounts-auto-reconcilliation.md).
6. Repeat steps 2 through 5 for all text on incoming documents that you want to automatically create documents for.

## To handle errors when receiving electronic documents

1. On the **Incoming Documents** page, select the line for an electronic document received from the OCR service with errors, indicated by the *Error* value in the **OCR Status** field.
2. Choose the **Edit** action to open the **Incoming Document** page.
3. On the **Errors and Warnings** FastTab, select the message, and then choose the **Open Related Record** action.
4. The page that contains the wrong or missing data, such as a vendor card with a missing field value, opens.
5. Correct the error or errors as described in each error message.
6. Proceed to process the incoming electronic document by choosing the **Create Manually** action again.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for any remaining errors until the electronic document can be received successfully.

## To train the OCR service to avoid errors

Because OCR is based on optical recognition, the OCR service can wrongly interpret characters in your PDF or image files when it first processes documents from a certain vendor, for example. It may not interpret the company logo as the vendor's name or it may misinterpret the total amount on an expense receipt because of its layout. To avoid such errors going forward, you can correct data received by the OCR service and then send the feedback to the service.

The **OCR Data Correction** page, which you open from the **Incoming Document** page, shows the fields from the **Financial Information** FastTab in two columns, one with the OCR data editable and one with the OCR data read-only. When you choose the **Send OCR Feedback** button, the content of the **OCR Data Correction** page is sent to the OCR service. Next time the service processes PDF or image files that contain the data in question, your corrections will be incorporated to improve the document recognition.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Documents**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open an incoming document record that contains data received from the OCR service that you want to correct.
3. On the **Incoming Document** page, choose the **Correct OCR Data** action.
4. On the **OCR Data Correction** page, overwrite the data in the editable column for each field that has an incorrect value.
5. To undo corrections that you have made since you opened the **OCR Data Correction** page, choose the **Reset OCR Data** action.
6. To send the corrections to the OCR service, choose the **Send OCR Feedback** action.
7. To save the corrections, close the **OCR Data Correction** page.

The fields on the **Financial Information** FastTab on the **Incoming Document** page are updated with any new values that you entered in step 4.

# Revalue Fixed Assets

Revaluation of fixed assets can consist of appreciations, write-downs, or general value adjustments.

When the value of a fixed asset increases, you post a journal line with appreciation to the depreciation book. The new amount is recorded as appreciation according to the fixed asset posting setup.

When the value of a fixed asset decreases, you post a journal line with a lower amount, a write-down, to the depreciation book. The new amount is recorded as a write-down according to the fixed asset posting setup.

Indexation is used to adjust multiple fixed asset values, for example per general price changes. The **Index Fixed Assets** batch job can be used to change various amounts, such as write-down and appreciation amounts.

## To post appreciation from the fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create an initial journal line and fill in the fields as necessary.
3. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Revaluation**.
4. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for appreciation posting.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   Step 4 only works if you have set up the following: On the **FA Posting Group Card** page for the posting group of the fixed asset, the **Appreciation Account** field contains the general ledger debit account and the **Appreciation Bal. Account** field contains the general ledger account to which you want to post balancing entries for appreciation. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).  
5. Choose the **Post** action.

## To post a write-down from the fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create an initial journal line, and fill in the fields as necessary.
3. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Write-Down**.
4. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for write-down posting.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   Step 4 only works if you have set up the following: On the **FA Posting Group Card** page for the posting group of the fixed asset, the **Write-Down Account** field contains the general ledger credit account and the **Write-Down Expense Account** field contains the general ledger debit account to which you want to post balancing entries for write-downs. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).
5. Choose the **Post** action.

## To perform general revaluation of fixed assets

Indexation is used to adjust multiple fixed asset values, for example per general price changes. The **Index Fixed Assets** batch job can be used to change various amounts, such as write-down and appreciation amounts. The **Allow Indexation** checkbox on the **Depreciation Book** page must be selected.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Index Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

    Revaluation lines are created per your settings in step 2. The lines are created in either the fixed asset journal or the fixed asset G/L journal, depending on your template and batch setup on the **FA Journal Setup** page. For more information, see [Set Up General Fixed Asset Information](fa-how-setup-general.md).
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Select the journal with the fixed assets that you want to revalue, and then choose the **Ledger Entries** action.  
6. Check the created entries, and then choose the **Post** action to post the journal.

    > [!TIP]  
    >   If the index figures are for simulation purposes only, you can create a special depreciation book to store them in. Then these entries will not affect any of the other depreciation books.

## To post other acquisition costs

You post other acquisition cost for a fixed asset from a purchase invoice or from a fixed asset journal in the same way as you post the original acquisition cost. For more information, see [Acquire Fixed Assets](fa-how-acquire.md).  

If depreciation is already calculated for the fixed asset, select the **Depr. Acquisition Cost** checkbox to have the other acquisition cost less the salvage value depreciated in proportion to the amount by which the previously acquired fixed asset is depreciated. This method ensures that the depreciation period isn't changed.  

The depreciation percentage is calculated as:  

*P = (total depreciation x 100) / depreciable basis*

*Depreciation amount = (P/100) x (extra acquisition cost - salvage value)*  

Remember to select the **Depr. until FA Posting Date** checkbox on the invoice, the fixed asset G/L journal, or the fixed asset journal lines to ensure that depreciation is calculated from the last fixed asset posting date to the posting date of the other acquisition cost.

### Example - Posting Other Acquisition Costs

A machine is purchased on August 1, 2000. The acquisition cost is 4,800. The depreciation method is straight-line over four years.

On August 31, 2000, the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run. Depreciation is calculated as:

*book value x number of depreciation days / total number of depreciation days = 4800 x 30 / 1440 = 100*  

On September 15, 2000, an invoice is posted for painting the machine. The invoice amount is 480.

If you selected the **Depr. until FA Posting Date** checkbox on the invoice before posting, the following calculation is made:  

15 days of depreciation (from 09/01/00 to 09/15/00) is calculated as:

*book value x number of depreciation days / remaining number of depreciation days = (4800 - 100) x 15 / 1410 = 50*

If you selected the **Depr. Acquisition Cost** checkbox on the invoice before posting, the following calculation is made:  

*The other acquisition cost is depreciated as ((150 x 100) / 4800) / 100 x 480 = 15*

The depreciable basis is now *5280 = (4800 + 480)*, and the accumulated depreciation is *165 = (100 + 50 + 15)*, corresponding to 45 days of depreciation of the total acquisition cost. This calculation means that the asset is totally depreciated within the estimated lifetime of four years.  

When the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run on 09/30/00, the following calculation is made:  

*Remaining depreciable life is 3 years, 10 months, and 15 days = 1395 days*  

*Book value is (5280 - 165) = 5115*  

*Depreciation amount for September 2000: 5115 x 15 / 1395 = 55.00*  

*Total of depreciation = 165 + 55 = 220*  

If you didn't select the **Depr. until FA Posting Date** checkbox, the asset would lose 15 days of depreciation because the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job run on 09/30/00 would calculate depreciation from 09/15/00 to 09/30/00. This means that when the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run on 09/30/00, the calculation is as follows:  

*Remaining life time is 3 years, 10 months, and 15 days = 1395 days*  

*Book value is (4800 + 480 - 100 - 15) = 5165*

*Depreciation amount for September 2000: 5165 x 15 / 1395 = 55.54*  

*Total of depreciation = 100 + 15 + 55.54 = 170.54*

# Understanding WIP methods in project management

As a project progresses, materials, resources, and other expenses are consumed and must be posted to the project. Work in Process (WIP) is a feature that enables you to estimate the financial value of projects in the general ledger while the projects are ongoing. In many cases, you might post expenses for a project before invoicing a project. When only expenses are posted, your financial statement is inaccurate.

To track the value in the general ledger, you can calculate WIP and post the value to the general ledger. For more information, see [Monitor Project Progress and Performance](projects-how-monitor-progress-performance.md).

Out of the box, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the following methods of calculating and recording the value of work in process.

| WIP Method | Description | Recognized Costs | Recognized Sales |
| --- | ------- |--- | --- |
| Cost Value |Recognizes cost when the customer is invoiced. Recognizes sales based on the invoiced sales. |Cost Value|Contract (Invoice Price)|
| Cost of Sales |Recognizes cost when the customer is invoiced. Recognizes sales based on the invoiced sales.|Cost of Sales|Contract (Invoiced Price)|
| Sales Value |Recognizes costs as they're reported. Recognizes sales proportionally to the reported costs.|Usage (Total Cost)|Sales Value|
| Percentage of Completion |Recognizes costs as they're reported. Recognizes sales proportionally to the reported costs.|Usage (Total Cost)|Percentage of Completion|
| Completed Contract |No sales or costs are part of the WIP calculation. Completed contract doesn't recognize revenue and costs until the project is complete. For example, this option is useful when there's high uncertainty around the estimates of costs and revenue for the project.|At Completion|At Completion|

Exact formulas and general ledger transactions are defined by the selection in the [**Recognized Cost**](#recognized-cost) and [**Recognized Sales**](#recognized-sales) fields.

## Create a project WIP method

Create a project WIP method that meets the needs of your organization and set it as the default.  

> [!NOTE]
> After you use a method to create WIP entries, you can't modify or delete the method.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project WIP Methods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, select the appropriate values for the **Recognized Costs** and **Recognized Sales** fields, and then fill in the other fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Close the page.
4. To make this method the default, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **projects setup**, and then choose the related link.  
5. In the **Default WIP Method** field, choose the method from the list.

### Recognized cost

When project status is changed to Completed, the **Calculate WIP** task reverts the WIP transaction and posts instead.

Dt **Recognized Cost Account** Cr **Project Cost Applied Account** , Amount: **Actual (Total Cost)**

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the selection in the **WIP Posting Method Used** field, the **Item Cost Applied Account**, **Resource Cost Applied Account**, or **G/L Cost Applied Account** could be used instead of **Project Cost Applied Account**. For more information, see [Project posting groups](projects-how-setup-jobs.md#to-set-general-information-for-projects).

### Recognized sales

| Recognized Sales | Recognized Sales Calculation Formula | General Ledger Entries |
| --- | --- | ---------- |

# Set Up Put-away Templates

With directed put-away and pick functionality, the most appropriate bin for your items at any given time is suggested, according to the put-away template that you have set up for the warehouse, the bin rankings you have given to the bins, and the minimum and maximum quantities that you have set up for fixed bins.  

You can set up a number of put-away templates and select one of them to govern put-aways in general in your warehouse. You can also select a put-away template for any item or stockkeeping unit that might have special put-away requirements.  

## To set up put-away templates

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Put-away Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Enter a code that is the unique identifier of the template you are about to create.  
4. Enter a short description, if you wish.  
5. Fill in the first line with the bin requirements that you want fulfilled first and foremost when suggesting a put-away.

    For example, if want the default put-away method to be based on fixed bins, then choose the **Find Fixed Bin** field. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
6. Fill in the second line with the bin requirements that would be your second choice to fulfill in finding a bin for put-away. The second line is used only if a bin that meets the requirements of the first line cannot be found.  
7. Continue to fill in the lines until you have described all the acceptable bin placements that you want to use in the put-away process.  
8. On the last line in the put-away template, select the **Find Floating Bin** check box.  

You can create various put-away templates and then apply them as you see fit. The put-away template that you selected for the item or stockkeeping unit, if any is used first. If these fields are not filled in, then the put-away template that you selected for the warehouse on the **Bin Policies** FastTab on the location card is used.

# Assign permissions to users and groups

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-long](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-long.md)]

The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] security system controls which objects a user can access within each database or environment, in combination with the user's license. For each user you can specify whether they're able to read, modify, or enter data in database objects. For more information, see [Data Security](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/data-security?tabs=object-level) in the developer and administration content for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

Before you assign permissions to users and user groups, you must define who can sign in by creating users according to their license. For more information, see [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], there are two levels of permissions to database objects:

- Overall permissions according to the license, also referred to as the entitlement.

  The licenses include default permission sets. Starting in 2022 release wave 1, admins can customize these default permissions for the relevant license types. For more information, see [Configure permissions based on licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md#licensespermissions).  

- Detailed permissions that you assign in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

This article describes how to define, use, and apply permissions in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to change the default configuration.  

[!INCLUDE [admin-gdap-users](includes/admin-gdap-users.md)]  
For more information, see [Delegated administrator access to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/delegated-admin).  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online includes default user groups that are assigned to users automatically based on their license. You can change the default configuration by modifying or adding security groups, permission sets, and permissions. The following table outlines key scenarios for modifying the default permissions.  

|To  |See  |
|---------|---------|
|To make it easier to manage permissions for multiple users, you can organize them in security groups and then assign or change one permission set for many users in one action.| [Manage permissions through user groups](#manage-permissions-through-user-groups) |

> [!NOTE]
> An broader way to define which features users have access to is by setting the **Experience** field on the **Company Information** page. For more information, see [Change Which Features are Displayed](ui-experiences.md).
>
> You can also define the features that are available to users in the user interface and how they interact with them through pages. You do this through profiles that you assign to different types of users according to their job role or department. For more information, see [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md) and [Customizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](ui-customizing-overview.md).

## Create a permission set

> [!NOTE]
> In 2022 release wave 2 we made it easier to add permissions to permission sets. Rather than adding permissions individually, you can add entire permission sets. If needed, you can then exclude individual permissions in them. For more information, see [To add other permission sets](#to-add-other-permission-sets). To make that possible, we replaced the Permission Set page with a new one. The key differences are the new **Permission Sets** and **Results** panes, and the **Included permissions** FactBox. To continue using the replaced Permissions page, on the **Permission Sets** page, choose the **Permissions (legacy)** action.

Maintenance is also easier. When you add a system permission, your user-defined permission set will be automatically updated with any changes that Microsoft makes to those permissions.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Permission Sets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the new line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **Permissions** action.
5. On the **Permission Set** page, in the **Type** field, include or exclude permissions to the object as follows:

  To include the permission, choose **Include**, and then choose level of access to give in the **Read Permission**, **Insert Permission**, **Modify Permission**, **Delete Permission**, and **Execute Permission** fields. The following table describes the options.

  |Option|Description|Ranking|
  |------|-----------|-------|
  |**Blank**|The user can't perform the action on the object.|Lowest|  
  |**Yes**|The user can perform the action on the object.|Highest|
  |**Indirect**|The user can perform the action on the object, but only through another related object that the user has full access to. For more information, see [Example - Indirect Permission](#example---indirect-permission) in this article, and [Permissions Property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-permissions-property#example---indirect-permission) in Developer and IT-Pro Help.|Second highest|
  
  To exclude the permission, or one or more access levels, choose **Exclude**, and then choose the level of access to give. The following table describes the options.

  |Option|Description|
  |------|-----------|-------|
  |**Blank**|Use the access level based on the hierarchy of permissions in the set.  |
  |**Exclude**|Remove the specific access level for the object.|
  |**Reduce to indirect**|Change the access level to Indirect if any permission sets give Direct access to the object. For example, choose this option if the permission set gives Direct access to G/L entries but you don't want users to have full access to the entries.|
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > If a permission is in a permission set that is included, and is also in a permission set that is excluded, the permission will be excluded.

6. Use the **Object Type** and **Object ID** fields to specify the object you're giving access to.

  > [!TIP]
  > New lines show default values. For example, the **Object Type** field contains **Table Data**, and the **Object ID** field contains **0**. The default values are just placeholders, and aren't used. You must choose a type of object and an object in the **Object ID** field before you can create another new line.

7. Optional: If you're defining permissions for a Table Data object type, in the **Security Filter** field you can filter the data that a user can access in fields on the selected table. For example, you might want to let a user access only records that contain information about a particular customer. For more information, see [Security filters limit a user's access to specific records in a table](#security-filters-limit-a-users-access-to-specific-records-in-a-table) and [Using Security Filters](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/security-filters).
8. Optional: On the **Permission Sets** pane, add one or more other permission sets. For more information, see [To add other permission sets](#to-add-other-permission-sets).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use caution when assigning **Insert Permission** or **Modify Permission** to the **9001 User Group Member** or **9003 User Group Permission Set** table. Any users assigned to the permission set could potentially assign themselves to other user groups, which in turn might give them unintended permissions.

### Example - Indirect Permission

You can assign Indirect permission to allow a user to use an object, but only through another object. For example, a user has permission to run codeunit 80, Sales-Post. The Sales-Post codeunit performs many tasks, including modifying table 37, Sales Line. When the user posts a sales document using the Sales-Post codeunit, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks whether the user has permission to modify the Sales Line table. If not, the codeunit can't complete its tasks, and the user receives an error message. If so, the codeunit runs successfully.

However, the user doesn't need to have full access to the Sales Line table to run the codeunit. If the user has Indirect permission for the Sales Line table, the Sales-Post codeunit runs successfully. When a user has Indirect permission, they can only modify the Sales Line table by running the Sales-Post codeunit or another object that has permission to modify the Sales Line table. The user can only modify the Sales Line table when doing so from supported application areas. The user can't run the feature inadvertently or maliciously by other methods.

### To add other permission sets

Expand a permission set by adding other permission sets to it. Afterward, you can include or exclude specific permissions, or entire permission sets, in each set you add. This includes permissions in the Extension and System type permission sets, which otherwise isn't allowed. Exclusions apply only to the permission set you're expanding. The original set isn't affected.

On the **Permission Set** page, add a permission set on the **Permission Sets** pane. The **Result** pane lists all added permission sets. To explore the permissions that are included in a set you've added, choose the set on the Result pane and the **Included permissions** FactBox will show the permissions.

On the **Result** pane, use the **Inclusion Status** field to identify the permission sets in which you've excluded permissions or permission sets. If something's been excluded, the status will be **Partial**.

For an overall view of permissions in the permission set, choose the **View all permissions** action. The **Expanded Permissions** page shows all permissions that were already assigned to the permission set and the permissions in the added permission sets.

To fully exclude all permissions from a permission set, on the **Result** pane, select the line, choose **Show more options**, and then choose **Exclude**. When you exclude a permission set, a line is created on the **Permission Sets** pane of the type Excluded. If you've excluded a permission set, but want to include it again, delete the line on the **Permission Sets** pane.

To fully or partially exclude a specific permission in a set you've added, under **Permissions**, create a line for the object. The access level fields, Insert Permission, Modify Permission, and so on, will all contain **Exclude**. To allow a certain access level, choose the appropriate option.

Excluding a permission set excludes all of the permissions in the set. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates permissions as follows:

1. Calculate the full list of included permissions
2. Calculate the full list of excluded permissions
3. Remove excluded permissions from the list of included permissions (removing an indirect permission is the same as Reduce to Indirect)

## Copy a permission set

Create a new permission set by copying another. The new set will include all of the permissions and permission sets from the set you copied. How the permissions and permission sets are arranged in the new permission set differs, depending on your choice in the **Copy operation** field. The following table describes the options.

|Option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Copy by reference**     | The original permission set and all of the permission sets that were added to it are listed on the **Results** pane.       |
|**Flat permission copy**  | All permissions from all permission sets are included in a flat list on the **Permissions pane**. Permissions are not organized by permission set.        |
|**Clone**     | Create an exact copy of the original permission set.        |

1. On the **Permission Sets** page, select the line for a permission set that you want to copy, and then choose the **Copy Permission Set** action.
2. On the **Copy Permission Set** page, specify the name of the new permission set.
3. In the **Copy operation** field, specify how to arrange permission in the new permission set.
4. Optional: If you're adding a System permission set, you might want to be notified if the name or content of the original permission set changes in a future version. This lets you consider whether to update your user-defined permission set. To receive a notification, turn on the **Notify on Changed Permission Set** toggle.

> [!NOTE]
> The notification requires that the **Original System permission set changed** notification is enabled on the **My Notifications** page.

## Create or modify permissions by recording your actions

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Permission Sets**, and then choose the related link.

    Alternatively, on the **Users** page, choose the **Permission Sets** action.
2. On the **Permission Sets** page, choose the **New** Action.
3. On a new line, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **Permissions** action.
5. On the **Permissions** page, choose the **Record Permissions** action, and then choose the **Start** action.  
    Recording must be done either by using the **Open this page in a new windows** (pop-out) feature to have the **Permissions** recording window side-by-side, or by working within the same tab.  
    A recording process now starts and captures all of your actions in the user interface.
6. Go to the various pages and activities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that you want users with this permission set to access. You must carry out the tasks that you want to record permissions for.
7. When you want to finish the recording, return to the **Permissions** page, and then choose the **Stop** action.
8. Choose the **Yes** button to add the recorded permissions to the new permission set.
9. For each object in the recorded list, specify whether users are able to insert, modify, or delete records in the recorded tables.

### To export and import a permission set

To quickly set up permissions, you can import permission sets that you exported from another [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant.

In multi-tenant environments, a permission set will be imported into a specific tenant. In other words, the scope of the import is *Tenant*.

1. In tenant 1, on the **Permission Sets** page, select the line or lines for the permission sets to export, and then choose the **Export Permission Sets** action.

    An XML file is created in the download folder on your machine. By default, the name is *Export Permission Sets.xml*.

2. In tenant 2, on the **Permission Sets** page, select the **Import Permission Sets** action.
3. On the **Import Permission Sets** dialog page, consider if you want to merge existing permission sets with any new permission sets in the XML file.

    If you select the **Update existing permissions** checkbox, existing permission sets that match names in the XML file will be merged with the imported permission sets.

    If you don't select the **Update existing permissions** checkbox, permission sets that match names in the XML file will be skipped during import. In that case, you'll be notified about permission sets that are skipped.

4. From the **Import** dialog page, find and select the XML file to be imported, and then choose the **Open** action.

The permission sets are imported.

## Remove obsolete permissions from all permission sets

On the **Permission Sets** page, choose the **Remove Obsolete Permissions** action.

## Set up time constraints for users

Administrators can define periods of time during which specified users are able to post. Administrators can also specify if the system logs how much time users are signed in. Similarly, administrators can assign responsibility centers to users. For more information, see [Work with Responsibility Centers](inventory-responsibility-centers.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **User Setup** page opens, choose the **New** action.
3. In the **User ID** field, enter the ID of a user, or choose the field to see all current Windows users in the system.
4. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## Control access to specific companies

When you have multiple companies in Business Central, managing permissions across companies requires extra consideration. You might not want users to have identical access rights to all companies. Instead, you may need to grant users' permissions based on their company affiliations. To support this scenario, when you assign permission sets to individual users or security groups, you have the option to select a specific company to which the permission set applies. The company isn't explicitly specified within the permission set, but rather when the permission set is assigned to the user or security group.

If you don't specify the company when assigning a permission set, the permission set then applies to all companies. If you want a permission set to apply to more than one company, but not all companies, add the permission set specifically for each company separately.

Learn how at [Assign permission sets to users](#assign-permission-sets-to-users) or [Assign permissions to a security group](ui-security-groups.md#assign-permissions-to-a-security-group).

## Manage permissions through user groups

User groups help you manage permission sets across the company. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online includes default user groups that are assigned to users automatically based on their license. You can add users manually to a user group, and you can create new user groups as copies of existing ones.  

You start by creating a user group. Then you assign permission sets to the group to define which object users of the group can access. When you add user to the group, the permission sets defined for the group will apply to the user.

Permission sets assigned to a user through a user group stay synchronized. A change to the user group permissions is automatically propagated to the users. If you remove a user from a user group, the involved permissions are automatically revoked.

### To add users to a user group

The following procedure explains how to create user groups manually. To create user groups automatically, see [To copy a user group and all its permission sets](#to-copy-a-user-group-and-all-its-permission-sets).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Groups**, and then choose the related link.

    1. Alternatively, on the **Users** page, choose the **User Groups** action.
2. On the **User Group** page, choose the **User Group Members** action.
3. On the **User Group Members** page, choose the **Add Users** action.

### To copy a user group and all its permission sets

To quickly define a new user group, you can copy all permission sets from an existing user group to your new user group.

> [!NOTE]
> The user group members are not copied to the new user group. You must add them manually afterwards. For more information, see the [To add users to a user group](#to-add-users-to-a-user-group) section.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the user group that you want to copy, and then choose the **Copy User Group** action.
3. In the **New User Group Code** field, enter a name for the group, and then choose the **OK** button.

The new user group is added to the **User Groups** page. Proceed to add users. For more information, see the [To add users to a user group](#to-add-users-to-a-user-group) section.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You'll get a validation error if you're trying to assign a user group to the user that refers to a permission set which was defined in an uninstalled extension. It's because the App ID of the extension is validated whenever it's referenced. To assign that user group to a user, you can either re-install the extension, remove the reference of the uninstalled extension from the permission set, or remove that permission set from the user group.

### To assign permission sets to user groups

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the user group that you want to assign permission to.  

    Any permission sets that are already assigned to the user are displayed in the **Permission Sets** FactBox.
3. Choose the **User Permission Sets** action to open the **User Permission Sets** page.
4. On the **User Permission Sets** page, on a new line, fill in the fields as necessary.

### To assign a permission set on the Permission Set by User Group page

The following procedure explains how to assign permission sets to a user group on the **Permission Set by User Group** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Users** page, select the relevant user, and then choose the **Permission Set by User Group** action.
3. On the **Permission Set by User Group** page, select the **[user group name]** field on a line for the relevant permission set to assign the set to the user group.
4. Select the **All User Groups** checkbox to assign the permission set to all user groups.

You can also assign permissions sets directly to a user.

## Assign permission sets to users

A permission set is a collection of permissions for specific database objects. All users must be assigned one or more permission sets before they can access [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

A [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] solution contains predefined permission sets that are added by Microsoft or by your solution provider. You can also add new permission sets tailored to meet the needs of your organization. For more information, see the [Create a permission set](#create-a-permission-set) section.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not want to restrict a user's access more than already defined by the license, you can assign a special permission set called SUPER to the user. This permission set ensures that the user can access all objects specified in the license.
>
> A user with the Essential license and the SUPER permission set has access to more functionality than users with the Team Member license and the SUPER permission set.

You can assign permissions sets to users in two ways:

- From the **User Card** page by selecting permission sets to assign to the user.
- From the **Permission Set by User** page by selecting users that a permission set is assigned to.

### To assign a permission set on a user card

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
1. Select the user that you want to assign permission to.

   Any permission sets that are already assigned to the user are displayed in the **Permission Sets** FactBox.
1. Choose the **Edit** action to open the **User Card** page.
1. On the **User Permission Sets** FastTab, on a new line, fill in the fields as necessary. For more information, see [Create or edit a permission set](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#create-a-permission-set).

   If you want the permission set to apply to a specific company, set the **Company** field to that company. If you want the permission set to apply to all companies, leave the **Company** field blank. [Learn more](#control-access-to-specific-companies).

## To assign a permission set on the Permission Set by User page

This method makes it easier for you to assign different permission sets to multiple users. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
1. On the **Users** page, choose the **Permission Set by User** action.
1. If you want the permission sets to apply only to a specific company, set the **Company name** field to that company. If you want the permission set to apply to all companies, leave the **Company name** field blank. [Learn more](#control-access-to-specific-companies).
1. On the **Permission Set by User** page, select the **[user name]** checkbox on a line for the relevant permission set to assign the set to the user.

    Select the **All Users** checkbox to assign the permission set to all users.

## Get an overview of a user's permissions

You can view other users' effective permissions only if you're assigned to the SECURITY or SUPER permissions. 

The **Effective Permissions** page offers additional information about the source of each permission. For example, whether the source is a security group, or a permission is inherited. The page also contains a column where administrators can review the security filters that are applied. To learn more about security filters, go to [Security filters limit a user's access to specific records in a table](#security-filters-limit-a-users-access-to-specific-records-in-a-table).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of the relevant user.
3. Choose the **Effective Permissions** action.

    The **Permissions** part lists all the database objects that the user has access to. You can't edit this section.

    The **By Permission Set** part shows the assigned permission sets through which the permissions are granted to the user, the source and type of the permission set, and to which extent the different access types are permitted.

    For each row that you select in the **Permissions** section, the **By Permission Set** section shows which permission set or sets that the permission is granted through. In this section, you can edit the value in each of the five access type fields, **Read Permission**, **Insert Permission**, **Modify Permission**, **Delete Permission**, **Execute Permission**.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Only permission sets of type **User-Defined** can be edited.
    >
    > Rows of source Entitlement originate from the subscription license. The permission values of the entitlement overrule values in other permission sets if they have a higher ranking. A value in a non-entitlement permission set that has a higher ranking than the related value in the entitlement will be surrounded by brackets to indicate that it is not effective as it is overruled by the entitlement.
    >
    > For an explanation of ranking, see [Create a permission set](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#create-a-permission-set).  

4. To edit a permission set, in the **By Permission Set** part, on the line for a relevant permission set of type **User-Defined**, choose one of the five access type fields and select a different value.

5. To edit individual permissions within the permission set, choose the value in the **Permission Set** field to open the **Permissions** page.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you edit a permission set, the changes will also apply to other users that have the permission set assigned.

### Security filters limit a user's access to specific records in a table

For record-level security in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], use security filters to limit a user's access to data in a table. You create security filters on table data. A security filter describes a set of records in a table that a user has permission to access. You can specify, for example, that a user can only read the records that contain information about a particular customer. In this way, the user can't access the records that contain information about other customers. For more information, see [Using Security Filters](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/security-filters) in the administration content.


## View permission changes telemetry

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to send changes that are done to permission to an Application Insights resource in Microsoft Azure. Then, using Azure Monitor, you create reports and set up alerts on the gathered data. For more information, see the following articles in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Developer and admin help:

- [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry - Enabling Application Insights](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview#enable)

# Handling missing option values

This article is intended for a technical audience. The processes it describes require the help of a developer.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contains three option set fields that contain values that you can map to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fields of the Option type for automated synchronization. During synchronization, nonmapped options are ignored and the missing options are appended to the related [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and added to the **Dataverse Option Mapping** system table to handle manually later. For example, by adding the missing options in either product and then updating the mapping.

The **Integration Table Mapping** page contains three fields that contain one or more mapped option values. After a full synchronization, the **Dataverse Option Mapping** page contains the nonmapped options in the three fields.

|         Record             | Option Value | Option Value Caption |
|----------------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Payment Terms: NET30	     | 1            | Net 30	           |
| Payment Terms: 2%10NET30   | 2            | 2% 10; Net 30        |
| Payment Terms: NET45	     | 3            | Net 45               |
| Payment Terms: NET60	     | 4            | Net 60               |
| Shipment Method: FOB	     | 1            | FOB                  |
| Shipment Method: NOCHARGE  | 2            | No Charge            |
| Shipping Agent: AIRBORNE   | 1            | Airborne             |
| Shipping Agent: DHL        | 2            | DHL                  |
| Shipping Agent: FEDEX      | 3            | FedEx                |
| Shipping Agent: UPS        | 4            | UPS                  |
| Shipping Agent: POSTALMAIL | 5            | Postal Mail          |
| Shipping Agent: FULLLOAD   | 6            | Full Load            |
| Shipping Agent: WILLCALL   | 7            | Will Call            |

The content of the **Dataverse Option Mapping** page is based on enum values in the **CRM Account** table. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], the following fields on the account table are mapped to fields on the customer and vendor records:

- **Address 1: Freight Terms** of data type Enum, where values are defined as follows:

```
enum 5335 "CDS Shipment Method Code"
{
    Extensible = true;
    value(0; " ") { Caption = ' '; }
    value(1; "FOB") { Caption = 'FOB'; }
    value(2; "NoCharge") { Caption = 'No Charge'; }
}
```

- **Address 1: Shipping Method** of data type Enum, where values are defined as follows:

```
enum 5336 "CDS Shipping Agent Code"
{
    Extensible = true;
    value(0; " ") { Caption = ' '; }
    value(1; "Airborne") { Caption = 'Airborne'; }
    value(2; "DHL") { Caption = 'DHL'; }
    value(3; "FedEx") { Caption = 'FedEx'; }
    value(4; "UPS") { Caption = 'UPS'; }
    value(5; "PostalMail") { Caption = 'Postal Mail'; }
    value(6; "FullLoad") { Caption = 'Full Load'; }
    value(7; "WillCall") { Caption = 'Will Call'; }
}
```

- **Payment Terms** of data type Enum, where values are defined as follows:

```
enum 5334 "CDS Payment Terms Code"
{
    Extensible = true;
    value(0; " ") { Caption = ' '; }
    value(1; "Net30") { Caption = 'Net 30'; }
    value(2; "2%10Net30") { Caption = '2% 10; Net 30'; }
    value(3; "Net45") { Caption = 'Net 45'; }
    value(4; "Net60") { Caption = 'Net 60'; }
}
```

All of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] enums are mapped to option sets in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

## Extending option sets in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]
1. Create a new AL extension.

2. Add an Enum extension for the options that you want to extend. Be sure that you use the same value. 

```
enumextension 50100 "CDS Payment Terms Code Extension" extends "CDS Payment Terms Code"
{
    value(779800001; "Cash Payment") { Caption = 'Cash Payment'; }
    value(779800002; "Transfer") { Caption = 'Transfer'; }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You must use the same option ID values from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] when you extend the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] enum. Otherwise synchronization will fail.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Do not use the ","  character in the enum values and captions. This is currently not supported by the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> The first ten characters of the new option value names and captions must be unique. For example, two options named "Transfer 20 working days" and "Transfer 20 calendar days" will cause an error because both have the same first 10 characters, "Transfer 2". Name them, for example, "TRF20 WD" and "TRF20 CD."

## Update [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] option mapping
Now you can recreate the mapping between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] options and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records.

On the **Integration Table Mapping** page, choose the line for the **Payment Terms** map, and then choose the **Synchronize Modified Records** action. The **Dataverse Option Mapping** page is updated with the following records.

|         Record                 | Option Value   | Option Value Caption |
|--------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Payment Terms: NET30	         | 1              | Net 30	             |
| Payment Terms: 2%10NET30       | 2              | 2% 10; Net 30        |
| Payment Terms: NET45 	         | 3              | Net 45               |
| Payment Terms: NET60	         | 4              | Net 60               | 
| **Payment Terms: CASH PAYME**  | **779800001**  | **Cash Payment**     |
| **Payment Terms: TRANSFER**    | **779800002**  | **Transfer**         |

The **Payment Terms** table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has new records for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] options. In the following table, new options are in bold font. Italic rows represent all options that can now be synchronized. Remaining rows represent options aren't in use and are ignored during synchronization. You can remove them or extend Dataverse options with the same names.

# The Basic Experience extension

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

If you have been using Microsoft Dynamics C5, Microsoft partners can help you transition to a more modern solution that is based on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], so you can continue to enjoy the same streamlined capabilities as Dynamics C5.

This extension is intended for small businesses and can support up to three users. If you need more users, you must upgrade to a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license and uninstall this extension.

> [!NOTE]
> As of now, this extension is available only to customers in Denmark and Iceland.

## What's available

The following table describes the capabilities that are available if you install the Basic Experience extension.

|Area  |Functionality  |
|---------|---------|
|**General Ledger** |Basic finance, financial reports, fixed assets, bank management, bank reconciliation, payments, direct debit, dimensions, multiple currencies, budgets, workflow, document management/OCR, consolidation, unlimited companies|
|**Accounts Receivable/Sales** |Basic receivables, sales invoicing, sales discounts, pricing, sales tax, contact management |
|**Accounts Payable/Purchase** |Basic payables, purchase invoicing |
|**Project Management** |Jobs, job pricing, time sheets, assignments, tasks, resources |
|**Inventory** |Basic inventory, item substitutions, item cross reference |

## Getting started

This extension is a bit different than most, and you'll need help from a Microsoft partner to install and set it up. So that you know what to expect, here's a high-level view of what the Microsoft partner does.

1. Create a new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant. This can be either a trial or a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) version.
2. Add at least one user who is assigned to a Basic Experience license in your Microsoft Entra account.
3. Remove all companies, including the sample Cronus company.
4. Create a new company that doesn't contain any sample data or setups.
5. Add the **Demo RapidStart** package. <!--what does the package contain?-->
6. Download and install the Basic Experience extension from AppSource.

## Migrating data

Bring your Dynamics C5 data along. After your Microsoft partner installs the Basic Experience extension, you'll have an empty company. An easy way to move your data from Dynamics C5 to Basic Experience is to use the C5 Data Migration extension, which is included in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The extension migrates customers, vendors, items, and your general ledger accounts and their entries.

# Reverse Output Posting

There are times when output posting must be reversed. An example of this would be if a data entry error occurred and an incorrect amount of output is posted to a production order.  

## To reverse an output posting

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Output Journal**, and then choose the related link. Select your batch.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. For more information, see [Batch Post Output and Run Times](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md).
3. In the **Applies-To Entry** field, select the associated item ledger entry. This reverses the capacity and item ledger entries.  
4. Post the reversal by posting the journal.  

The output journal entries are posted to the item ledger as a positive adjustment.

# Acquire fixed assets

Use the **Fixed Asset Card** page to enter information about an asset. You can set up buildings or production equipment as a main asset with a component list, and you can group them in various ways, such as by class, department, or location. You must set up and assign a depreciation book to each fixed asset before you can acquire it.

After you set up a fixed asset and assign a depreciation book, you must acquire the fixed asset. To acquire a fixed asset, you record its acquisition cost in the relevant G/L account, bank account, or vendor by posting an acquisition transaction from the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page. You can use the **Assisted Fixed Asset Acquisition** page to create and post the required general journal lines automatically.

Use indexation to adjust values for general price-level changes. Use the **Index Fixed Assets** batch job to calculate the acquisition costs and replacement costs.

## Add a fixed asset to your list of fixed assets

Before you can acquire a fixed asset, you must add it to your list of assets. There are several ways to add fixed assets to your list:

* Enter information about the assets on the **Fixed Asset Card** page.
* Use the **Edit in Excel** action to download your list of assets to a worksheet, add new assets to the list, and then publish the update to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Use a purchase order to add assets.
* Use the **Copy fixed asset** action.

After you add fixed assets to your list, the next step is to acquire them so you can use them in transactions. Learn more at [Acquire a fixed asset](#acquire-fixed-assets).

### Add a fixed asset on the Fixed Asset Card page

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. On the **Depreciation Book** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. This step assigns a depreciation book to the fixed asset.  
4. If you need to assign more than one depreciation book to the fixed asset, choose the **Add More Depreciation Books** action. To learn more, go to [To assign a depreciation book to a fixed asset](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md#to-assign-a-depreciation-book-to-a-fixed-asset).

    After you fill in the required fields, the **You are ready to acquire the fixed asset.** notification appears at the top of the page. If you're ready to acquire the asset now, choose the **Acquire** action. Follow the steps on the **Assisted Fixed Asset Acquisition** page to complete the acquisition. If you aren't ready, you can always acquire the asset later.

### Use Edit in Excel to add assets

If you want to add numerous fixed assets, Edit in Excel is a great tool to use. The tool downloads your current list of assets in a worksheet that includes most of the fields available on the Fixed Asset Card page. You can fill in some or all of fields on a row for each asset, and publish your changes to add them to your list in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you can't fill in all required field, that's ok. You can update them in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when you're ready.

> [!NOTE]
> To use the Edit in Excel action, you must have the Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in installed. The add-in creates the connection between Excel and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Get the Business Central Add-in for Excel](admin-deploy-excel-addin.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the :::image type="content" source="media/share-icon.png" alt-text="Share this page with other users or apps icon."::: icon, and then choose **Edit in Excel**.
3. Open the downloaded file, and enter information about the new fixed assets.

   > [!TIP]
   > You don't need to enter an identifier in the **No.** column. When you publish your update, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns an identifier based on the number series you use for fixed assets.

4. To update [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Microsoft Dynamics** pane, choose **Publish**.

### Add a fixed asset from a purchase order or invoice

The following steps describe how to add a fixed asset from a purchase order. The steps are similar for a purchase invoice.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **New** to create a new purchase order.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, choose **Fixed Asset**.
5. In the **No.** field, either choose an existing fixed asset to add an expense, or choose **New** to add a new asset.
6. After you enter the information for the new asset and the purchase order, choose **Post**.

## Acquire a fixed asset by using a fixed asset G/L journal

The following procedure describes how to acquire by creating and posting the required fixed asset G/L journal lines. You can also create and post the journal lines manually. To learn more, go to [Acquire a fixed asset by using a fixed asset G/L journal](#acquire-a-fixed-asset-by-using-a-fixed-asset-gl-journal).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the asset you want to acquire, and then choose the **Acquire** action.
1. Follow the steps on the **Assisted Fixed Asset Acquisition** page to complete the acquisition.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also post acquisition cost as credits. In that case, remember that the value in the **Acquisition Cost Incl. VAT** field must be with a minus sign to indicate a credit.

When you choose **Finish**, the **Book Value** field on the **Fixed Asset Card** page is filled in, which indicates that the fixed asset was acquired at the specified acquisition cost.  

## To post a fixed asset acquisition manually with a fixed asset G/L journal

The following procedure describes how to acquire a fixed asset manually by creating and posting lines on the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page. You can also acquire a fixed asset automatically on the **Fixed Asset Card** page by choosing the **Acquire fixed asset** action. To learn more, go to [Acquire a fixed asset](#acquire-fixed-assets).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also post acquisition cost as credits. In that case, remember that the value in the **Amount** field must be with a minus sign to indicate a credit.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page, in the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Acquisition Cost**.
3. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **Post** action.  

> [!TIP]  
> If you fill in the **Insurance No.** field, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also posts the acquisition cost of the fixed asset to the insurance coverage ledger. To learn more, go to [Insure Fixed Assets](fa-how-insure.md).

## To set up a component list for a main asset

You can group your fixed assets into main assets and their components. For example, you might have a production machine that consists of several parts that you want to group in this manner.  

You must set up the main asset and all its components as individual fixed asset. After you set up a component list, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically fills in the **Main Assets/Component** and **Components of Main Asset** fields on the fixed assets.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the fixed asset that is the main asset, and then choose the **Main Asset Components** action.
3. On the **Main Asset Components** page, choose the **FA No**. field, and then select the fixed asset that you want to add as a component of the main asset.
4. Close the page.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each component asset that you want to add.
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Setup**, and then choose the related link.
7. Turn on the **Allow Posting to Main Assets** toggle.

## To cancel an acquisition cost posting for one fixed asset

If you make an error when posting an acquisition cost, you can remove the entry with the **Cancel FA Entries** batch job and then post the correct acquisition entry. The erroneous entries are transferred to the **FA Error Ledger Entries** page.

For example, if you post an acquisition with the wrong date, you must correct it as soon as possible because the fixed asset posting date is used for many calculations.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can't use the **Reverse Transactions** action for fixed asset entries.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Ledger Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **FA Ledger Entries** page, select the entry or entries that you want to cancel.  
3. Choose the **Actions** menu, and then choose the **Cancel Entries** action.
4. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. Choose the **OK** button to run the batch job.
6. When the incorrect entry or entries are canceled, proceed to post the correct acquisition cost.

## To post the salvage value together with the acquisition cost

The salvage value is the residual value of a fixed asset when it can no longer be used. You can post the salvage value at the same time as you post the acquisition cost. To learn more, go to [Depreciate or Amortize Fixed Assets](fa-how-depreciate-amortize.md).

You can post the salvage value together with the acquisition cost from a fixed asset journal.

> [!NOTE]
> This process might require that you personalize the Fixed Asset Journals page by adding the Salvage Value field. By default, the field is not displayed on the page. To learn more, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Fixed Asset Journals** page, create the acquisition line. To learn more, go to [To post a fixed asset acquisition manually with a fixed asset G/L journal](#to-post-a-fixed-asset-acquisition-manually-with-a-fixed-asset-gl-journal).
3. In the **Salvage Value** field on the journal line, enter the salvage value amount as a credit (prefix the amount with a minus sign, for example, **-**100).
4. Choose the **Post** action.

> [!NOTE]
> If a salvage value exists for a fixed asset, that value is used in depreciation posting instead of the value in the **Ending Book Value** field on the **FA Depreciation Books** page. To learn more, go to [To manage the ending book value](fa-how-depreciate-amortize.md#to-manage-the-ending-book-value).

# Manage product variants

Item variants are a great way to keep your list of products under control. For example, you have a large number of items that are almost identical and vary only in color. You can define each variant as a separate item. But you can also choose to set up one item and specify the various colors as variants of the item.  

> [!TIP]
> For a practical introduction to using variants in production, see [Walkthrough: Variants](contoso-coffee/manufacturing/variants.md) for the Contoso Coffee demo data.  

## Add variants to an item

It's easy enough to define variants for an item.  

### To add variants

1. Open [the **Items List** page](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=31), open the relevant item.  
2. On the **Item** card, choose the **Related** action, then choose **Item**, and then choose the **Variants** action.  
3. On the **Item Variants** page, list the variants.  

Then, when you create a sales document and add the item, you can specify the variant of the item in the Variant **Code** field. The same applies to purchasing documents.  

## Item availability by variant

[!INCLUDE [inventory_variant-availability](includes/inventory_variant-availability.md)]

## Require use of variants

Starting in 2022 release wave 2, admins can require that users specify the variant in documents and journals for items that have variants. To activate the capability, on the **Inventory Setup** page, and select the **Variant Mandatory if Exists** field. You can override this global setting for specific items.  

On item cards, the **Variant Mandatory if Exists** field has the following options:

|Field value |Description|
|---------|----|
|Default (No)| The setting from **Inventory Setup** applies to this item.|
|No| Users aren't required to specify a variant for this item.|
|Yes| If the item has one or more variants, users must specify the relevant variant. If they don't, they're blocked from posting the transaction.|

> [!NOTE]
> These settings don't affect items that don't have variants.

If the capability is switched on, you can't post an entry if the variant isn't specified.

# Manage user settings and preferences

As an administrator, you can configure user settings in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], similar to how individual users can manage their own preferences in the **My Settings** page.  

Get an overview of all users in the **Users** list, and change individual settings by selecting the **User Settings** action for the relevant user.

> [!TIP]
> The **User Settings** list shows the current settings for each user. To view or edit individual users, select the **View** or **Edit** action.

The **User Settings** card page is similar to the **My Settings** page that each user has access to, and it's a powerful tool for you as the administrator for setting default settings and clearing personalized pages, for example.  

## Types of user settings

*User settings* isn't the same as *user setup*, which is about the user as an entity and the user's access in the system. Furthermore, the user settings have nothing to do with a user's personalization, such as lightweight changes to the user interface. User settings determine the predefined settings for each user in various aspects of the way the application presents itself to the user. The following paragraph lists the five types of user settings and preferences that can be set by the individual or centrally by the administrator:

* **Company**  

  This setting determines the company to be logged into at the next sign-in. A user can have access to multiple companies and can be active in several companies.

* **Role**  

  The role, or profile, describes the user's function in the company, such as *Sales Manager*, *Bookkeeper*, or *Purchasing Agent*. The profile then determines the user's role center, the home page that users experience when they sign in. The profile doesn't impact access rights to functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

* **Language**  

  Defines the application language that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] presents text, captions, and error messages in. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users are synchronized from Microsoft 365, the language settings from Microsoft 365 are used, assuming that the user wants to use the same settings in Office products and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The administrator can change the default setting, and each user can choose between available languages in the My Settings page. But they'll be reset to the value from Microsoft 365 once the next synchronization is performed.

  If the language setting from Microsoft 365 matches a supported language in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], this language is chosen for the user.  

  > [!NOTE]
  > You may have to install a language app for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to properly display the language. Therefore, it's a good practice to install the necessary language apps before any user logs in the first time so that they have a good experience from their first day. For more information, see the list of [supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations).  
  
* **Region**  

  Defines how dates and numbers are presented in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client, such as whether to use European or American date formats, or how to display the decimal sign and thousand separators in amounts. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users are synchronized from Microsoft 365, the regional settings from Microsoft 365 are used, assuming that the user wants to use the same settings in Office products and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. An administrator or user can change these settings manually in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], but they'll be reset to the value from Microsoft 365 once the next synchronization is performed.

* **Time zone**  

  Defines the time zone in which the user is located. Currently this setting isn't synchronized from Microsoft 365 and must be set manually.  

* **Teaching tips**

  [!INCLUDE [ua-teachingtips](includes/ua-teachingtips.md)] As an administrator, you can switch off teaching tips for all users, such as if you are in process of onboarding users who are already familiar with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

> [!NOTE]
> If a Microsoft 365 user synchronization is made while users are logged into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], these users must refresh the browser or sign out and back in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to see a potential different language set by the synchronization action.

## Overview of all user-specific changes

As the administrator, you can get an overview of individual changes to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that each user might have made to various pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. As users make changes to their experience in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], these changes are reflected in the **Personalized Pages** list. <!--Administrators can also set these settings for users before they log in the first time, so users do not have to do it themselves, providing them a better *getting started* experience.-->

<!-- >[!NOTE]
> User personalizations do not have anything to do with the *personal* lightweight changes a user can make to the user experience.-->

## Review or delete user personalizations

1. Select the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Personalized Pages**, and then select the related link.
2. This shows the list of users and their personalized pages. To clear a user's personalization, click the relevant row, or select **Manage**, and then select **Delete**.

This task deletes the personalization, and the user's experience of the relevant page returns to the default state.

# Changing from a QuickBooks app to Dynamics 365 Business Central

More growing businesses are changing from finance apps like QuickBooks Desktop and QuickBooks Online, which are designed for startups and other small businesses, to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], which also supports larger, more complex organizations. 

As they transition, companies typically want to bring their business data with them so they don't start from scratch. To help transfer data, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers built-in extensions that migrate data such as customers, vendors, inventory items, and general ledger accounts. The following extensions are installed and ready to go as an integrated part of the **Data Migration** assisted setup guide:

* QuickBooks Data Migration 
* QuickBooks Online Data Migration

For more information, read about the extension that suits your QuickBooks app:   

* [The QuickBooks Desktop Data Migration Extension](ui-extensions-quickbooks-data-migration.md)
* [The QuickBooks Online Data Migration Extension](ui-extensions-quickbooks-online-data-migration.md)

## Ready now?

If you're ready to get started now, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link. Choose **Migrate business data**, and then follow the steps in the guide.

# Combine receipts on a single invoice

If you want to invoice more than one purchase receipt at a time, you can select multiple receipt lines on the purchase invoice.  

Before you can create a combined purchase receipt, more than one receipt from the same vendor in the same currency must be posted. In other words, you must have filled in two or more purchase orders and posted them as received, but not invoiced.  

When purchase receipts are combined on an invoice and posted, then a posted purchase invoice is created for the invoiced lines. The **Quantity Invoiced** field on the originating purchase order, or blanket purchase order, is updated based on the invoiced quantity. However, this original purchase document isn't deleted, even if it has been fully received and invoiced, and you must therefore delete the purchase document.  

> [!NOTE]
> The resulting purchase invoice cannot later be corrected or canceled. If you want to modify a purchase invoice that is created in this way, you must use purchase credit memos. For more information, see [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-correct-cancel-unpaid-purchase-invoices.md).

## To combine receipts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Get Receipt Lines** action.  
4. Select multiple receipt lines that you want to include in the invoice.  

    If an incorrect receipt line was selected or you want to start over, you can just delete the lines on the purchase invoice and then use the **Get Receipt Lines** function again.  
5. To post the invoice, choose the **Post** action.  

## To remove open purchase orders after combined receipt posting

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Purchase Orders**, and select the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

Alternatively, delete the individual orders manually.

Repeat steps 1 through 3 for any other affected documents, such as blanket purchase orders.

# Set up invoice rounding

If you need to round invoice amounts when you create invoices, you can use the automatic rounding function. When an invoice is rounded, an extra line is added with the rounding amount and posted with the other invoice lines.

> [!NOTE]  
> Local regulations or local custom might require that you to round invoice amounts in a specific way. For example, to an amount divisible by 0.05.  

To use automatic invoice rounding, you must:  

* Specify the general ledger accounts to which rounding differences are posted.  
* Set up rules for rounding invoices in local currency and in foreign currency.  
* Activate the function.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  In addition to the invoice rounding features, you can round amounts on invoices by the unit-amount rounding feature and the amount rounding feature.  

## Set up general ledger accounts for invoice rounding differences

To use automatic invoice rounding, you must set up the general ledger account or accounts where rounding differences are posted. Before you can do so, you must set up VAT product posting groups. For more information, see [Set up VAT](finance-setup-vat.md).  

### To set up general ledger accounts for invoice rounding differences  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, set up the account and name it **Invoice Rounding** or something similar. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the account name as text for invoices that are rounded.  
3. Depending on whether you use VAT or sales tax, in the **Tax Prod. Posting Group** or **VAT Prod. Posting Group** fields, choose a posting group for rounded amounts. You might want to set up a new group code to use for invoice rounding.
4. Leave the **Gen. Posting Type**, and either the **Tax Bus. Posting Group** or **VAT Bus. Posting Group** fields blank. <!-- Why do we say to leave these blank, when there are a lot of other fields we also leave blank but don't mention? -->  

Now you can assign the invoice rounding account to posting groups on the **Vendor Posting Groups** page.  <!-- Why only the vendor posting groups? -->

## Set up rounding for foreign and local currencies
Before you can use the automatic invoice rounding function, you must set up rounding rules for foreign and local currencies.

### To set up rounding for foreign currencies  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Currencies**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Currencies** page, choose the foreign currency to open the **Currency Card**, and then fill in the **Amount Rounding Precision**, **Unit-Amount Rounding Precision**, **Invoice Rounding Precision** and **Invoice Rounding Type** fields.

### To set up rounding for your local currency
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, on the **General** FastTab, fill in the **Inv. Rounding Precision** and **Inv. Rounding Type** fields.  

## Activate the invoice rounding function  
To ensure that sales and purchase invoices are rounded automatically, you must activate the invoice rounding function. You activate invoice rounding separately for sales and purchase invoices.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup** or **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, choose the **Invoice Rounding** check box.

# Set up or change the Chart of Accounts

The chart of accounts (COA) shows the ledger accounts that store your financial data. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a standard COA that is ready to support your business. You can, however, change the default accounts, and you can add new accounts.
<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=944c65b0-9b0f-4d35-b330-de2fad57143a]

## Add or change accounts

From the COA, you can open each general ledger (G/L) account and add or change settings. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] 

If necessary, you can use more than one line for a general ledger account name. On the **G/L Account Card** page, in the **Account** group, choose **Extended Texts**, and then fill in one or more lines with the account name and copied text.  

For accounts of the **Total** account type, you must fill in the **Totaling** field. For **End-Total** accounts, this field is filled in automatically by the Indent function. After you set up the accounts, choose the **Process** action, then choose **Indent Chart of Accounts**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have entered definitions in the **Totaling** fields for **End-Total** accounts before executing the indent function, you must enter them again because the function overwrites the values in all **End-Total** fields.

## Delete accounts

You can delete a general ledger account. However, before you delete it, the following conditions must be true:  

* The balance on the account must be zero.  
* The **Allow G/L Acc. Deletion Before** field must be set on the **General Ledger Setup** page, and the account must not have ledger entries on or after that date.  
* If the **Check G/L Account Usage** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page is selected, the account must not be used in any posting groups or posting setup.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] prevents you from deleting a general ledger account that stores data that is needed in the chart of accounts.  

You can also specify when to allow people to delete accounts. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** toggle works together with the date in the **Check G/L Acc. Deletion After** field to act as an extra validation. If you turn on the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** toggle, you can't delete G/L accounts with ledger entries after the date in the **Check G/L Acc. Deletion After** field. To delete such an account, someone with access to the **General Ledger Setup** page must turn off the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** toggle.  

Turning on the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** field is often a best practice, as is setting the date in the **Check G/L Acc. Deletion After** field, for example, to the date through which regulations require you to store finance data.  

### Video guidance

This video shows how to specify whether, and when, people can delete G/L accounts.

# About calculating standard cost

Many manufacturing companies select a valuation base of standard cost. This choice also applies to companies that do light manufacturing, such as assembly and kitting. A standard cost system determines inventory unit cost based on some reasonable historical or expected cost. Studies of past and estimated future cost data can provide the basis for standard costs. These costs are frozen until a decision is made to change them. The actual cost to produce a product can differ from the estimated standard costs. For management control, the actual cost is compared to the standard cost for a specific item and differences, or *variances*, are identified and analyzed.  

Standard costs can be maintained for items that are replenished through purchase, assembly, and production. For each replenishment method, standard costs can consist of the following elements.  

|Replenishment System|Standard Cost Elements|  
|--------------------------|----------------------------|  
|**Purchase**|Direct material cost and overhead material cost if it's required.|  
|**Assembly**|Direct material cost, direct or fixed labor cost, and overhead cost.|  
|**Prod. Order**|Direct material cost, labor cost, subcontractor cost, and overhead cost.|  

## Set up standard costs

Because the standard cost of a produced or assembled item can consist of multiple cost elements, including material, capacity (labor) and direct and overhead subcontractor costs, standard costs must be established for each of these elements.  

The accounting task for an item-processing company using standard costing is to:  

- Estimate a standard cost of the finished item and set it up on the item card.  
- Record and allocate the actual cost of the key cost elements and to account for variances.  

To determine the direct cost of a finished item, all component costs must be totaled. An assembled or produced item can include subassemblies, which also consist of multiple components.  

The following key cost elements make up the total direct cost of a finished processed item:  

- Material costs.  
- Capacity cost.  
- Subcontracting costs for produced items only.  

### Material costs

Material costs are costs that are associated with subassemblies and purchased raw material. Material unit cost can consist of direct and indirect cost elements.  

- Direct material cost represents an invoiced amount for purchased raw materials or the processing cost of a subassembly.  
- Indirect material cost, or *overhead*, can represent elements such as inventory carrying costs for the finished item after it's produced.  

The setup of the material cost for purchased items that affect direct and indirect cost depends on the costing method that you have selected for the specified item. You set up cost information for either costing method on the item card. For more information, see [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

The cost of scrap (production only) is another factor to consider when you calculate the total material cost. When a certain amount of raw material is scrapped when you assemble or produce an item, it generally causes an increase in the quantity of components that are required to produce this item. This increases the material cost of the components that are consumed when producing a parent item. You set up scrap cost for materials on either the production BOM or routing.  

The material cost of a produced item can be represented in two ways that correspond to the following cost calculation bases.  

|Cost Calculation Basis|Material Cost Calculation|  
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|  
|Single level|Produced item is equal to the total cost of all purchased or subassembled items on that item's production BOM.|  
|Rolled-up level or multilevel|Produced item is the sum of the material cost for all subassemblies on that item's BOM and the cost of all purchased items on that item's production BOM.|  

### Capacity costs

Capacity costs are the costs that are associated with internal labor and machine costs. You must set up these costs for each resource (in assembly management) and work or machine center on the routing (in production). As with materials, you can identify both direct and indirect elements of capacity cost. For example, the direct cost for a work center can be the established shop rate to perform a specific function. The indirect cost for a work center can represent some general factory expenses, such as lighting, heating, and so on. As with material costs, you can express capacity overhead as an indirect cost percentage or a fixed overhead rate.  

The setup of the capacity costs of assembled items consists of the following elements:  

- Direct and indirect unit cost of the resource.  
- Fixed or direct resource usage type.  

The setup of the capacity costs of produced items consists of the following elements:  

- Direct and indirect unit cost of the machine or work center.  
- Time and lot size setup.  

To calculate standard capacity cost, you have to establish the standard time rates that are required to perform operations on machine and work centers. The total time to complete an operation typically consists of setup, run time, and wait and move time.  

You set up the rates for each time type for each machine or work center on an individual routing.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  While run time rates apply for each item unit that is produced, the setup time rates apply for each lot. Therefore, you must prorate the routing setup time for each operation over the lot size. You specify the lot size in the corresponding field on the **Replenishment** FastTab of the **Item Card** page.  

To specify setup time on the routing for planning but not include this expense in the standard cost calculation, clear the **Cost Incl. Setup** field on the **Manufacturing Setup** page.  

On a single-level basis, this is the labor cost that is required to produce the finished production item and is specified on the production item's routing. On a multi-level basis, this is the capacity cost that is specified for each individually produced item that is included in the parent item's BOM.  

### Subcontractor costs

Subcontractor costs are the costs that are associated with services that are provided by a company's outside vendors or subcontractors. Similar to material and capacity, subcontractor costs can consist of both direct and overhead amounts. Direct subcontractor cost represents the actual charge for each unit of services that is provided. For example, overhead subcontractor cost can represent freight and handling costs that the company incurs with a subcontracted order.  

Because subcontracting is an outsourced capacity, you set up the cost of both direct and indirect subcontracting services on the work center card that represents the subcontracting operation.  

## Populate standard cost

You can set standard cost manually or you can calculate the item's standard cost from the **Item card** page. Choose the **Production** group, then choose the **Calc. Production Std Cost** action to update cost of production items or choose the **Assembly** group, then choose the **Calc. Assembly Std. Cost** action to update cost of assembly item. The actions will consolidate and roll up the component and capacity costs to calculate the total assembly or manufacturing cost of the items. 

To calculate the unit cost of an assembly or production BOM, the parent item and its component items must use the Standard costing method. Any resources in the BOM are rolled up if they have a unit cost that is defined on the item, resource. workcenter card. Not cost defined on stockkeeping unit (SKU). 

If you have open entries, after implementing the changes to **Standard Cost** field on the item card, remember to perform inventory revaluation. For more information, see [Revalue Inventory](inventory-how-revalue-inventory.md).

## Updating standard costs with Standard Cost Worksheet

The **Standard Cost Worksheet** is intended as a tool for purchasers, production or assembly managers, and internal controllers when they have to review and update standard costs.

Use the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page to do the following:

- Prepare the changes in advance of the date when they have to take effect.
- Simulate the effect on the cost of the manufactured or assembled item if the standard cost for consumption, production capacity usage, or assembly resource usage is changed.
- Execute the changes at a given date and let them take effect immediately.

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel](includes/edit-in-excel.md)]

Purchasers use the [**Suggest Item Standard Cost**](#suggest-item-standard-cost) batch job to update and work with the costs of purchased items in one worksheet. When the result is satisfactory, the worksheet is given to the internal controller.

Production or assembly managers use the [**Suggest Work/Mach Ctr Std Cost**](#suggest-workmach-ctr-std-cost) batch job to update and work with the production capacity costs and assembly resource costs of processed items in another worksheet. This worksheet is also given to the internal controller.

Internal controllers use the [**Copy Standard Cost Worksheet**](#copy-standard-cost-worksheet) batch job to consolidate the worksheets into one worksheet. Use the [**Roll Up Standard Cost**](#roll-up-standard-cost) batch job to make a roll-up of the costs from the purchaser and the production or assembly manager. The roll-up determines the standard costs of manufactured and assembled items. Controllers can preview cost changes before and after the roll-up to identify unacceptable deviations. When the updates are acceptable, the controller implements the changes to take effect on a given date.

Use the [**Implement Standard Cost Change**](#implement-standard-cost-change) batch job to implement the standard cost changes, which updates the standard costs on the item cards of the items that are included in the worksheet. It also creates revaluation journal lines so that you can update the items in stock with the new standard cost.

### To update standard costs

1. Run the **Adjust Cost-Item Entries** batch job. To start the batch job, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Adjust Cost-Item Entries**, and then choose the related link. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
2. Run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job. To start the batch job, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**, and then choose the related link. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Standard Cost Worksheet**, and then use one or more of the following actions:
    1. Run the **Suggest Item Standard Cost** batch job.  
    2. Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
    3. Run the **Suggest Capacity Standard Cost** batch job.  
    4. Review the results and make changes as necessary.
    5. Run the **Roll Up Standard Cost** batch job.
    6. Review the results and make changes as necessary.
    7. Run the **Implement Standard Cost Changes** batch job.  
4. Review and post the **Revaluation Journal** page, which has been populated with entries from the previous steps in this process.  

### Suggest Item Standard Cost

Creates suggestions for changing the costs and cost shares of standard costs on item cards. When the batch job has completed, you can see the result in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

> [!NOTE]  
> This batch job is intended for purchased items only. If you want to update an item with a production BOM or assembly BOM, then you must first fill in the worksheet with all the components and then run the **Roll Up Standard Cost** batch job.

This batch job only creates suggestions. It doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them,  then select **Implement Standard Cost Changes** in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

#### Options

**Standard Cost**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the standard cost. You can also select a rounding method for the new standard cost. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

**Indirect Cost %**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the indirect cost %. You can also select a rounding method for the new indirect cost %. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

**Overhead Rate**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the overhead rate. You can also select a rounding method for the new overhead rate. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

### Suggest Work/Mach Ctr Std Cost

Creates suggestions for changing the costs and cost shares of standard costs on work center, machine center, or resource cards. When the batch job has completed, you can see the result in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

This batch job only creates suggestions. It doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them,  then select **Implement Standard Cost Changes** in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

When you have run the batch job and want to see the impact on your production or assembly departments, then you run the **Roll Up Standard Cost** batch job to update standard costs on work centers, machine centers, assembly resources, production BOMs, and assembly BOMs.

#### Options
**Standard Cost**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the standard cost. You can also select a rounding method for the new standard cost. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

**Indirect Cost %**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the indirect cost %. You can also select a rounding method for the new indirect cost %. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

**Overhead Rate**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the overhead rate. You can also select a rounding method for the new overhead rate. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

### Copy Standard Cost Worksheet

Copies standard cost worksheets from several sources into the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

You can only copy one worksheet at a time. The lines from the copied worksheets will be placed below each other in the consolidated worksheet. Item lines are listed first, then work/machine center lines are listed, and resource lines are listed last.

### Roll up standard cost

Rolls up the standard costs of assembled and manufactured items. These are influenced by the change in standard costs of components suggested by the **Suggest Item Standard Cost** batch job. In addition, they're influenced by the change in standard cost of production capacity and assembly resources suggested by the **Suggest Work/Mach Ctr Std Cost** batch job.

Once you have run either or both of these batch jobs and you do the roll-up, then all changes to the standard costs in the worksheet are introduced in the associated production or assembly BOMs, and the costs are applied at each BOM level.

> [!NOTE] 
> This function only rolls up the standard cost on the item cards, not on the SKU cards.

This batch job only creates suggestions. It doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them, then you can use the **Implement Standard Cost Change** batch job. 

#### Options

**Calculation Date**: Enter the date that applies to the production BOM version you want to do the roll-up for.
 
### Implement standard cost change

Updates the changes in the standard cost in the **Item** table with the ones in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page. The standard cost change suggestions can be created with the **Suggest Item Standard Cost** and/or the **Suggest Work/Mach Ctr Std Cost** batch job, and they can also be modified. The contents of all the fields in the standard cost change suggestions are transferred. When you implement suggestions of changes to standard costs, you can see them on the item card and/or on the work/machine center cards. A revaluation journal is also created for you to update the value of existing stock.

#### Options

**Posting Date**: Enter the date that the revaluation should take place.

**Document No.**: Enter the number of the revaluation journal lines. If there's a number series set up on the item journal batch name, the document number follows the ledger entries made by the posting of the revaluation journal. Otherwise, you can manually enter a number.

**Item Journal Template**: Enter the name of the revaluation journal template.

**Item Journal Batch Name**: Enter the name of the actual revaluation journal

Select **OK** to start the batch job. If you don't want to run the batch job now, select **Cancel** to close the window.

Review and post the **Revaluation Journal** page, which has been populated with entries from the previous steps in this process.

# Set up approval workflows

You can set up and use workflows that connect business-process tasks performed by different users. System tasks, such as automatic posting, can be included as steps in workflows, preceded or followed by user tasks. Requesting and granting approval to create new records are typical workflow steps. Learn more at [Use Approval Workflows](across-use-workflows.md).

Before you begin to use approval workflows, you must set up workflow users and approval users, specify how users receive notifications about workflow steps, then create the workflows.

On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling in fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values that represent scenarios supported by the application code.

# Set Up Business Central Access in Teams with Microsoft 365 Licenses

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Administrators must complete multiple activities before users can access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with their Microsoft 365 license. The steps below represent the minimum setup required to get started. To learn more about access with Microsoft 365 licenses, go to [Business Central Access with Microsoft 365 Licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md).

## Guidelines

Setting up access with Microsoft 365 licenses involves the following tasks:

|Step|Task|Required|
|-|-|-|
|1|[Configure which Business Central data the Microsoft 365 licensed users have permission to view](#configure-permissions)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
|2|[Enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses on the Business Central environment](#enable-access-with-microsoft-365-licenses)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
|3|[Assign security group to the environment](#choose-who-gets-access-by-using-security-group)|
|4|[Deploy the Business Central app for Teams to users](#deploy-the-business-central-app-for-teams)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
|5|[Test the setup](#test-your-setup)||

> [!TIP]
> Except for the last task, you can complete the tasks in any order. You can do tasks separately, as described in the sections that follow or use the **Access with Microsoft 365 licenses** assisted setup guide to walk you through them.
>
> To run the assisted setup, do the following steps:
>
> 1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link.
> 2. On the **Assisted Setup** page, go to the **Do more with Business Central** section and select **Access with Microsoft 365 licenses**.
> 3. Follow the instructions.  

## Configure permissions

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is secure by design and minimizes risk by granting no permissions to Microsoft 365 users out of the box. Administrators must configure object permissions that determine which tables, pages and reports can be accessed in Teams with only a Microsoft 365 license. These permissions are the starting permissions assigned when a user signs in for the first time with their Microsoft 365 license. 

To configure starting permissions:

1. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], search for **License Configuration**.
2. Select the Microsoft 365 license.
3. At the top of the **Microsoft 365** license page, select the edit icon ![Edit icon](media/edit-pencil.png), then turn on **Customize permissions**. 
4. In the **Custom Permission Sets** section, add the appropriate permission sets and choose whether they're applicable to a single company or all companies within the environment.

With this configuration, users with only a Microsoft 365 license are added to the **Users** list when they access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for the first time. For more information about users, go to [Creating Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When synchronizing the users list in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with users in Microsoft 365, only users that have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license are added to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s users list. For more administrative control over permissions and profiles, you can assign a security group to the environment. When environments are secured using a security group and enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses, the **Update users from Microsoft 365** action in the **Users** page will also include users that only have a Microsoft 365 license. To learn about securing environments, see [Manage access using Microsoft Entra groups](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access#manage-access-using-azure-active-directory-groups) in the developer and IT pro help.

> [!TIP]
> Looking for a quicker way to get started when trying out this feature on a sandbox or evaluation company? Assign the **D365 Read** permission set, which grants permission to most objects.  

When working with multiple environments, license configuration must be applied to each environment and can be different on each environment.

Learn more at [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md) and [Composing Permission Sets](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-permissionset-composing).

## Enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses

Access with Microsoft 365 licenses is off by default. Access must be enabled for each environment independently, giving administrators control and allowing for staged rollout across the organization. You turn on access by using the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] admin center: 

1. In the upper-right corner, select **Settings** ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") > **Admin Center**.  
2. In the admin center, select **Environments**, then select the environment on which you want to change license access. 
3. On the **Environment details** page, select **Modify** for the **Access with Microsoft 365 licenses** setting.
4. In the **Microsoft 365 licenses** pane, turn on the switch. 
5. Select **Save** when done and accept the confirmation. The change comes into effect immediately.

## Choose who gets access by using security group

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

In the Business Center admin center, an environment can be assigned to one or more security groups to control access. You can assign a Microsoft Entra group to the environment. By assigning a Microsoft Entra group to an environment, only direct and indirect members of the group are granted access to the environment. Indirect members are users in another group, which itself is a member of the group assigned to the environment. Although all licensed users in Microsoft Entra ID will be added to the environment when it's synchronized with Microsoft 365, only group members can sign in. Learn more in [Manage access using Microsoft Entra groups](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access#manage-access-using-azure-active-directory-groups) in the developer and IT pro help.

People in the security group must also have an applicable Microsoft 365 license to access Business Central from within Microsoft Teams. Get a list of applicable licenses in [Business Central access with Microsoft 365 licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md#requirements-for-individual-users-to-access-data-in-teams).

## Deploy the Business Central app for Teams

For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license holders to share data in Teams, and for Microsoft 365 license holders to access that data, each must have the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams installed. Although users can install the app by themselves, it's recommended that administrators use centralized deployment. Centralized deployment lets you roll out the app to a broader audience across the organization and minimize individual user effort. Laern more in [Installing the Business Central app by using Centralized Deployment](admin-teams-integration.md#installing-the-business-central-app-by-using-centralized-deployment).

> [!NOTE]
> If you have run centralized deployment before and only deployed the app to the security group of licensed [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users, you'll need to run it again to deploy to additional groups or the whole organization, depending on how you are configuring access.

> [!TIP]
> Looking for a quicker way to get started when trying out this feature? Test users can install the app at [aka.ms/BCgetTeamsApp](https://aka.ms/BCgetTeamsApp).

## Test your setup

To verify that your setup is ready for production, the following steps will help you build the confidence that everything works as it should.

1. Create or identify two test users (A and B).

   - Test user A must have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license and Microsoft 365 license with access to Teams.
   - Test user B must have only a Microsoft 365 license with access to Teams.

2. Sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] web client as test user A.

   1. Open a record that test user B should have access to, such as an **Item** card in the appropriate company and environment.
   2. Select **Share** ![!Share to other apps action on pages.](media/share-icon.png) > **Share to Teams** to bring up the Share to Teams window.
   3. In the **Share to** field, add test user B as the recipient.
   4. Wait for the link to expand to a card and select Share.

3. Sign into Microsoft Teams as test user B.

   1. Select Chat and open the conversation with test user A.
   2. In the message sent by test user A, select the Details button on the card. If the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client is displayed and is read-only, your setup was successful.

# Use Power Automate flows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you're given a license to Microsoft Power Automate. This license lets you use your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data as part of a workflow in Microsoft Power Automate. You create flows and connect to your data from internal and external sources through the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connector.

Power Automate flows are triggered by events, such as a record being created, modified, or deleted. Flows can also be run on a user-defined schedule or on demand.

> [!NOTE]
> Administrators can restrict access to Power Automate. If you find that you don't have access to some or all of the features described in this article, talk to your admin. If you want to learn how you can control Power Automate access as an admin, see [Set Up Power Automate Integration](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-automate-setup).

<!-- You must have a valid account with both [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Power Automate. --> 

> [!TIP]
> In addition to Power Automate, you can use approval workflow templates in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Although they're two separate workflow systems, any approval workflow template you create with Power Automate is added to the list of workflows within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Workflows](across-workflow.md).

## About Power Automate flows

Power Automate is a service that helps you create automated workflows (or flows) between apps and services, like [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Power Automate flows require little or no coding knowledge. They can be associated with a wide range of events and responses, such as:

- Record changes
- External files updates
- Posted documents
- Different Microsoft and third-party services, like Microsoft Outlook, Excel, Dataverse, Teams, SharePoint, Power Apps, and more.

There are three different cloud flow types that you can work with:

|Flow type|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|Automated flow|This flow type is run automatically by an event. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an event could be when a record or document is created, modified or deleted. So, for example, a new sales invoice can trigger a flow for an approval request, which can have different events set depending on the approver's reply. A negative response sends a notification and email to the approval requester. A positive reply simultaneously updates an Excel spreadsheet located in a SharePoint folder and sends an update to a Teams chat. Automated flows can be started by both internal and external events in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|
|Approval flow|Approval flows are also automated flows in Power Automate, but they're designed specifically for requesting approval when changes are made to records and data. You can use approval flows in Power Automate as an alternative to the [approval workflows feature](across-use-workflows.md) that's part of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. |
|Scheduled flow|This type of flow is also automatically run but it runs periodically at a scheduled date and time. |
|Instant flow|This flow type is run on-demand, requiring the user to run it manually from a button or action in another app or device, in this case, the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client. Instant flows work similarly to batch shortcuts, performing multiple lengthy steps with a few button presses and are launched from specific pages or tables. For example, a flow can add a button to the action menu on the **Vendors** page to block payments to a vendor and, at the same time, send customizable emails to the vendor's contact and your company's purchasers as well as update the contact in Outlook. |

## Power Automate features

You can explore all Power Automate flows currently available to you by signing in to [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.com) and selecting **My flows** from the navigation bar on the left. Here you find any flows you have already created yourself and flows shared with you by an admin or coworker.

- Instant flows are also made available for running directly from most list, card, and document pages in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You find the instant flows in the **Automate** action group in the action bar of pages. To run a flow, select it, and follow the instructions presented to you. Learn more in the sections that follow.

- With automated flows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], there's nothing for you to do, unless you want to change them, or turn them off. Otherwise, they just work when triggered. 
<!--

## Automated flows

With Power Automate, you can create business flows directly in-house and rely on citizen developers. Automated workflows can be started by both internal and external events in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and also be set to run periodically. Learn more and get instructions on how to create flows in the [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) article in the administration content.

-->

## Run instant flows

Instant flows open inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online so you can remain within the context of the business process you were in the middle of doing. You can run an instant flow from most lists, cards, or documents.

1. In the action bar, select **Automate**, then choose a flow from the list of available flows under the **Power Automate** action.

    :::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-instant-menu.svg" alt-text="Shows the Automate action with instant flow actions.":::

    On some pages, **Automate** is nested under **More options (...)**. 
2. In the **Run Flow** pane, fill in any required fields, then select **Continue** to run the flow.

> [!NOTE]
> The first time you use the **Automate** item, you may see only the **Get started with Power Automate** action. You see this action because you haven't agreed to the privacy notice for Microsoft Power Automate. To continue, select **Get started with Power Automate** and follow the instructions to agree or disagree.  
>
> :::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-action.png" alt-text="Shows the Automate item in the action bar.":::

<!--

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can run a Power Automate flow from most list, card, and document pages. Once the admin has connected [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Power Automate, you'll see any flows your organization has added when you choose the **Automate** action on the relevant pages. Instant flows are run without leaving [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in the [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) article in the administration content.

These instant flows open on a page inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online so you can remain within the context of the business process you were in the middle of. Choose the **Automate** action—on some pages nested under the **More Options** menu—choose the **Power Automate** menu item, then choose the relevant link to trigger the workflow. The connection to Power Automate is already set up for you.

Most flows require you to fill in a field or two before you choose the **Run flow** action.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't see an **Automate** action, then your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] probably hasn't yet been set up to use Power Automate. Learn more from your admin.-->

## Create, edit, and manage flows

Creating new flows or modifying and managing existing ones (like turning them on or off) can be done directly in Power Automate. But you can initiate some of these tasks from the Automate action menu in  [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

:::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-menu.svg" alt-text="Shows the Automate action in the action bar with expanded actions.":::

- To create an automated flow from a list, card, or document page, select **Automate** > **Create automated flow**.
- To create an approval workflow from a card or document page, select **Automate** > **Create approval flow**.

  > [!TIP]
  > This action is only available on card and document type pages; not lists.
- To create an instant flow from a list, card, or document page, select **Automate** > **Create action based on a flow**.
- To open Power Automate from a list, card, or document page, select **Automate** > **Manage flows**.
<!--- To create new flows or manage existing flows from inside [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], got to the **Manage Power Automate Flows** page.-->

These tasks are typically done by an admin or super user. The tasks require a broader knowledge of the business processes in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to the following articles in the Business Central Dev and IT Pro help:

- [Power Automate integration](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-automate-overview)
- [Create automated flows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) (also covers approval flows)
- [Create instant flows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/instant-flows)
- [Manage Power Automate flows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/manage-power-automate-flows)
<!-- 

## Add more automated flows and instant flows

You can create flows through the [powerautomate.microsoft.com](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com) website. However, if your admin has switched on the capability to run Power Automate flows from inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can start the process of building a flow from the **Automate** action on the relevant pages, which can be found under the **More Options** menu depending on the page. Then choose the **Power Automate** menu item, and then choose the **Create a flow** action. Power Automate then opens in a new browser tab, and you're signed in automatically.

You can find sample templates to adapt to your company and all available trigger events, using both [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and external tools, by choosing the **Connectors** menu on the Power Automate website. Learn more about available templates and triggers in the [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) article in the administration content.

## Create and manage Power Automate flows

You can create new flows or manage existing Power Automate flows in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on the **Manage Power Automate Flows** page. Learn more in the [Manage Power Automate Flows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/manage-power-automate-flows) article in the administration content.

<!--
You can also manage available Power Automate workflows on the **Workflows** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The page lists both the built-in approval and Power Automate workflows, with options for the latter to enable/disable, delete, and view the workflow on the Power Automate website.-->

# Entering Data

There are many general features that help you enter data easier, faster, and more precise. The basic principles and advanced features for entering data are described in this article.  

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

The examples in this article use the demonstration data.

## Work with editable fields

Fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] may contain different editable data, such as text or currency amounts. Editable fields typically display an input box where you can type or choose a value. Non-editable fields are typically displayed with a gray background.

Some editable fields provide a picker to help you specify a value.  

<!-- TODO: Add illustrations or images of each picker -->
|**Picker**        |**How it helps you specify a value**|
|------------------|------------------------------------|
|Date picker       |This picker displays a calendar that is based on your current regional settings. It helps you choose a single date.|
|Dropdown          |Dropdowns provide a choice of fixed values or reference records from another table|
|Switch or Checkbox|Some fields provide a simple choice of *Yes* or *No* values. The switch is used to specify this value, and is always displayed as a checkbox in lists|
|Assist edit       |Some fields provide custom pickers that are suited to looking up and choosing the best value for that field, such as popup window|

### Modifying a field value

To modify the value of a field, you must first set focus to that field. You set focus by doing the following actions:

- Use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key. The action selects the entire value.
- Left-click your mouse or similar input device. This action will only select the entire field value if the field is in a list.  

When you interact with fields in the user interface, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] typically favors selecting the entire field value to make it easier for you to replace that value.

When the entire field value is selected:

- Replace the value by just typing to specify a new value. If the field offers a picker, you can activate it using the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> keyboard shortcut.
- Use the <kbd>Delete</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key to clear the value.

select the <kbd>F2</kbd> key to toggle between selecting the entire field value or placing the cursor after the field's value. Placing the cursor at the end of the value makes it easier for you to append to the existing value.

When the cursor is shown at the end of the field value:
- Add to the value by just typing.
- Use the <kbd>Home</kbd>, <kbd>End</kbd>, <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>, and <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> keys to move the cursor within the value. If you're editing a field in a list, selecting the <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> key again when the cursor is at the beginning of the value will set focus to the previous field. Similarly, selecting the <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> key again when the cursor is at the end of the value will set focus to the next field.

> [!NOTE]
> After you specify a value, Business Central will only check that it's valid after you click outside the field or set focus to another element, such as the next field.

## Use Copilot's autofill feature to assist in filling in fields

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

When drafting a new record or editing an existing record, Copilot can suggest values for editable fields on the page. Learn more in [Autofill fields with Copilot (preview)](autofill-fields-with-copilot.md).

## Keyboard Shortcuts

There are several keyboard shortcuts that let you work "mouse-free" and speed up your data entry. These keyboard shortcuts are especially useful with large-scale entries and repetitive typing tasks.

For more information about shortcuts, see [Keyboard Shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md). A few of the keyboard shortcuts are discussed in this article.

## <a name="QuickEntry"></a>Accelerating Data Entry Using Quick Entry

Quick Entry is a feature designed for data entry when using the keyboard. Quick Entry works on fields (like on card pages) and in lists (rows and columns). It's beneficial when doing repetitive typing tasks that require creating multiple records in sequence. Examples include a batch of sales orders or registering new items.

You can use the Tab key to navigate from one field on a page to the next editable field. A disadvantage of using Tab is that it always goes sequentially to the next field. <!-- even if the field is non-editable or seldom filled it in.-->Quick Entry lets you change this path. With Quick Entry, you use the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to navigate through only those fields that you're interested in. Quick Entry skips non-editable fields and fields that you typically don't fill in. You might have already noticed this behavior on some pages. This behavior is because the fields to include when pressing Enter and which ones to skip have been predefined. You can customize Quick Entry by personalizing your workspace and optimizing how you enter data on each page.

### How Quick Entry Works

Every field can be marked as either *included in Quick Entry* or *excluded from Quick Entry*. Fields that are included in Quick Entry will be included in the path when you select <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Fields that are excluded from Quick Entry won't.

When you're finished entering data in a field, you simply select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to confirm the changes and go to the next field. If you want to reverse direction, and go the previous field, select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>. For more information about shortcuts, see [Quick Entry Shortcuts for Fields](keyboard-shortcuts.md#QuickEntry).

#### Tips and Tricks

The following list provides some useful information about using Quick Entry.

- It's available for any editable fields.
- It also works across columns and rows.
- It doesn't prevent accessing other elements of a page, such as actions. These elements are still accessible by using <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>.  
- It's not required that FastTabs are expanded for Quick Entry to work. If the next Quick Entry field is located in a collapsed FastTab, that FastTab will automatically expand and focus on the chosen field. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will remember that the FastTab should be expanded next time you visit the page.  
- Quick Entry works no matter whether fields are mandatory. So it's a good idea to ensure that mandatory fields are included in Quick Entry.
- By default, most fields are automatically included in Quick Entry. So initially your task will most likely be excluding fields from Quick Entry.

### To change Quick Entry fields

To set up Quick Entry on fields, you use personalization.

1. Start personalization by selecting the ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") icon, and then the **Personalize** action.
2. Select a field that you want change. In lists, select the corresponding column heading. Then, choose either **Include in Quick Entry** or **Exclude from Quick Entry**.

For more information about personalization, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Mandatory Fields

When you enter data on pages, certain fields are marked with a red asterisk. The red asterisk means that the field must be filled to complete a certain process. An example is when you post a transaction that uses the value in the field.  

Although a field is mandatory, you aren't forced to fill the field before you continue to other fields or close the page. The red asterisk only serves as a reminder that you'll be blocked from completing a certain process.  

## Finding Data As You Type

 When you start to type characters in a field, a drop-down list is displayed and shows possible field values. The list changes as you type more characters, and you can select the correct value when it's displayed.  

 Many fields have a down arrow button that you can choose. You choose the arrow to get a list of data that is available to enter in the field. The button has two functions depending on the type of field:  

- Lookup - Displays information from another table that you can enter in the field. You can select one piece of data at a time.  

- Drop-down - Displays the set of options that exist for the field. You can select only one of the options.  

## Copying and Pasting FAQ Fields and Lines

You can copy one or more rows from a list or a single field on a page. Then paste what you copied into the same page, another page, or an external document. You could, for example, paste to Microsoft Excel or Outlook email. In short, to copy, select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> (cmd+C in macOS) on your keyboard. To paste, select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> or <kbd>cmd+V</kbd> in macOS.

In a list, to copy the field in the same column of the row above, and paste it into the current row, just select <kbd>F8</kbd>.

For more information, see [Copying and Pasting FAQ](faq-copy-paste.yml).

## Filtering Line Items

To start filtering, select ![Filter pane icon](media/open-filter-pane-icon.png "Filter pane icon") at the top of the list or select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd> to open the filter pane. You work with the filter pane as you do on any other list. For more information, see [Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#filtering).

Filtering is especially helpful when viewing and analyzing longer documents. Imagine you open a posted sales invoice. Then, you filter the line items to display all line items that have an individual discount above 5%. Or, you filter to display only bike accessories with 'pro' in the name.

## <a name="Focus"></a>Focusing on Line Items

When working on documents that include a line items part, you can switch your view to focus only on the line items. Example documents are sales order or invoice page. The line items part expands so that it occupies almost the entire workspace. It hides other parts of the page except the actions area at the top. This layout gives you a better overview of the lines items, and provides more room to work on them.

You'll benefit particularly when you work with large line item lists and you want to enter data fast. This feature also provides advanced filtering capability. Like on other lists, browsing and searching through line items becomes even easier.

### Switching the Focus On and Off

To focus on lines items, select anywhere in the line item part, and then choose ![Focus Mode icon.](media/focus-mode.png "Focus mode icon") in the upper right corner, or select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd>.

To switch back to the normal view, choose ![Focus Mode icon.](media/focus-mode.png "Focus mode icon") or select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd> again.

## Multitasking Across Multiple Pages

You can open a card or document page in a new window. Opening a new window lets you:

- Work on multiple tasks at the same time
- Manage interruptions to the current task, such as taking an incoming call.
- Keep a window open for an ongoing task while you start or complete another task in windows.

To open the current card or document in a new window, choose ![Open New Window.](media/open-new-window-icon.png "Open new window icon") in the upper right corner, or select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd>.

<!--
When working on multiple tasks at a time or when managing interruptions to the current task, such as taking an incoming call, you can open a card or document page in a new window. This allows you to keep a window open for an ongoing task while you start or complete another task in one or more other windows.
-->

> [!NOTE]
> When you open other pages from a card or document that is opened in a new window, those pages will open in a new window even though you don't choose ![Open New Window.](media/open-new-window-icon.png "Open new window icon").

> [!NOTE]
> If you work in the Safari browser, a pop-up blocker may cause the new window to not open. If this is the case, specify the product URL as an allowed website. For information see, [Change preferences in Safari](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2102965).<br /><br />
> The same may happen in other browsers, such as Firefox. For more information, see [Pop-up blocker settings in Firefox](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2116400).  

Another way to multitask is to open [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on two or more browser tabs. When you do it this way, you should create a new tab and then copy/paste the URL of the original tab into the new tab. This way creates a new session.   

> [!NOTE]
> Don't use the **Duplicate** function of the browser to create the new tab as this may cause actions on one tab to block actions on other tabs because they are part of the same session.

## Entering Quantities by Calculation

When entering numbers into quantity fields, such as the **Quantity** field on an item journal line, you can enter the formula instead of the sum quantity.  

### Examples  

- If you enter 19+19, the field is calculated to 38.  

- If you enter 41-9, the field is calculated to 32.  

- If you enter 12*4, the field is calculated to 48.  

- If you enter 12/4, the field is calculated to 3.  

## Entering Negative Numbers

You can enter negative numbers in two ways. The number -20.5 can be entered as:  

- -20.5  

  or
- 20.5-  

In both cases, the amount will be recorded in as -20.5.  

If the last character of the expression is a **+** or a **-**, the entire expression will be recorded with that sign. An example, **10-20+** will result in 10 and not -10.  

## Entering Dates and Times

You can enter dates and times in all the fields that are assigned to dates (date fields). You can enter dates with or without separators.

> [!NOTE]  
> How you enter dates and times depends on your **Region** settings. For more information, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).  

### Entering Dates

You can either use the data picker to select a date from a calendar, or you can enter dates manually. This section provides a brief overview of how to enter dates. For more information, see [Work with Calendar Dates and Times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

For manually date entry, you can enter two, four, six, or eight digits:  

- Two digits are interpreted as the day. It will add the month and the year of the work date.  

- Four digits are interpreted as the day and the month. It will add the year of the work date.  

- If the date you want is in the range 01/01/1950 through 12/31/2049, enter the year with two digits. Otherwise, enter the year with four digits.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the two-digit year range may be different. Administrators can change the range by modifying the **CalendarTwoDigitYearMax** setting of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] server. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#General).

You can also enter a date as a weekday followed by a week number. Or, you can enter a year. For example, Mon25 or mon25 means Monday in week 25.  

Instead of entering a specific date, you can enter one of these codes.  

|Code|Result|  
|--------------|----------------|  
|t|Specifies today's date (the system date for the computer).|  
|p|Specifies an accounting period, where p means the first accounting period, p2 means the second accounting period, and so on. |
|w|Specifies the work date that is set up in the application. To change the work date, see [Changing Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md). You may want to use a work date if you have many transactions with a date other than today's date.|
|c|Specifies that the date after c is a closing date, for example C123101.|  

## Entering Times

When you enter times, you can insert any separator sign that you want between the units, but it isn't required. You don't have to write minutes, seconds, or AM/PM.  

The following table lists the various ways in which times can be entered and how they're interpreted.  

|Entry|Interpretation|  
|---------------|------------------------|  
|5|05:00:00|  
|5:30|05:30:00|  
|0530|05:30:00|  
|5:30:5|05:30:05|  
|053005|05:30:05|  
|5:30:5,50|05:30:05.5|  
|053005050|05:30:05.05|  

 You enter two digits for each unit of time if you don't enter a separator.  

## Entering Combined Datetimes

[!INCLUDE [datetimes](includes/datetimes.md)]

## Entering Duration

You enter a duration as a number followed by its unit of measure.  

Here are some examples.  

|Duration|Unit of measure**|  
|------------------|-------------------------|  
|2h|2 hrs|  
|6h 30 m|6 hrs 30 mins|  
|6.5h|6 hrs 30 mins|  
|90m|1 hr 30 mins|  
|2d 6h 30m|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins|  
|2d 6h 30m 56s 600ms|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins 56 secs 600 msecs|  

 You can also enter a number and it's automatically converted to a duration. The number you enter is converted according to the default unit of measure that has been specified for the duration field.  

 To see the unit of measure used in a duration field, enter a number and see which unit of measure it's converted to.  

 The number 5 is converted to 5 hrs, if the unit of measure is hours.  

## <a name="decimal"></a>Setting the decimal separator used by numeric keyboards

When using the <kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> key on a numeric keypad to enter data, the actual decimal separator that's entered in the field is determined by your region setting in Business Central. Most regions use the period (.) or comma (,) symbol as a separator for decimal values, as you would typically see in currency amounts. The decimal key on your keypad adapts to your region. It's often different to the period or comma keys on the rest of your keyboard. You set the region in Business Central on the **My Settings**  page.

For example, suppose you're using a numeric keyboard that uses a period (.) as the <kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> key. But you're entering data for a regional language that uses a comma (**,**) for the decimal separator, like French (France). So, you want decimals like "1.23" to be entered as "1,23". In this case, you can go to the **My Settings** page and set the **Region** to the target regional language to **French (France)**. For more information, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md#region).

> [!TIP]
> There may be occasions when you want to use the decimal separator to enter a period (.). For example, suppose you were entering a date range in a filter, like `01/01/2022..04/01/2022`, or anything that requires a period. To accommodate this case, select the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> keys on the numeric keyboard. This key combination switches the decimal separator between outputting a period and the decimal separator as determined by the **Region** setting.

The **Document Date** and **Posting Date** fields on sales and purchase documents helps you comply with accounting standards and get accurate financial calculations. The fields serve different purposes:

- For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] to correctly calculate finance charges and the amount due on sales invoices, the **Document Date** must align with one of the following dates:

   - The date on the sales invoice that you sent to the customer. 
   - The date on the purchase invoice that you received from your vendor.
- The **Posting Date** shows when a document was registered in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)]. Many accounting standards and regulations require businesses to record and report financial transactions based on the date they occurred.

Depending on your business processes, these dates might or might not be the same. If they're the same, you can set up [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] to update the document date on sales and purchase documents with the date you posted them.  
  
To automatically set document dates to posting dates, on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** and **Purchases & Payables Setup** pages, turn on the **Link Doc. Date to Posting Date** toggle.

You might see other users in the **Users** list apart from those from your own company. When a delegated admin from a reselling partner company logs into a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] environment on behalf of their customer, they are automatically created as a user inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)]. This way, the actions performed by a delegated admin are logged in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)], such as posting documents, and associated with their user ID.  

With *granular delegated admin privileges (GDAP)*, the user is shown in the **Users** list and can be assigned any permissions. They are not shown with name and other personal information but with their company name and a unique ID. Both internal and external admins can see these users in the **Users** list, and they have full transparency into what these users do through the [change log](../across-log-changes.md), for example. But they can't see the actual name of these users. GDAP users are listed with user names in the following format: `User123456@partnerdomain.com`. They might have a user name that reflects the partner's company name, and the email address is not the person's actual email address. This way, the GDAP user accounts do not reveal personal information. If you need to find out who the person behind such a pseudonym is, you'll have to reach out to the company that this user works or worked for.

For each finance charge term code, you can specify multiple interest rates so that you can calculate finance charges with multiple interest rates for a specific period. This is helpful if you charge different interest on payments that are late. The interest calculation is the same for each financial charge, with variation only in the rate of interest for a specific period. If multiple interest rates are not set up, then the interest rate and period that is defined in the **Finance Charge Terms** and **Reminder Terms** pages for the whole period of calculation will be used.end of article

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you change the when event for a workflow step, the then responses also changes. Sometimes, then responses of other when events refer to these then responses as the next step in the workflow. After you change a when event, verify that the next steps for its then events are correct.  
>
> For example, the **Vendor Approval Workflow** workflow template has a primary when event **Approval of a vendor is requested**. This when event has a **Send approval request for the record and create a notification** then response, which other then responses reference. If you change the primary **Approval of a vendor is requested** when event to, for example, **A vendor record is changed**, the then response is cleared along with the references.
>
> The then responses for the **An approval request is delegated** and **An approval request is approved** (with the **On Condition** of **Pending Approvals >0**) when events are examples of where changing a primary when event can cause problems. Their then responses have a next step that refers to the **Send approval request for the record and create a notification** then response of the **Approval of a vendor is requested** when event. Because the then response for the **Approval of a vendor is requested** when event is no longer available, the indented when events won't work as expected.
>
> You'll need to specify the next steps for the then responses for when events that referred to the changed when event.end of article

After you enter your keywords, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] starts your search in the background and goes through each table one at a time. Search results begin to appear after it finished each table. If you enter more than one keyword, the results will include only records that have all of the words in any of the selected fields.

The results page shows the three most recently updated records. If there are more than three, you can choose **Show all results** to display them.

Each time you choose a search result you increase the popularity of the table, and it will appear higher in the results. Additionally, the record will be found more quickly if you search for it in the future.

## Use Edit in Excel on output, consumption, and item journals

One reason the Edit in Excel feature in is so popular is that it provides a fast way to enter data. For example, you can use templates for journals, quickly do bulk edits, and so on. You can use the feature to speed up data entry on item journals to include item tracking details such as lot, serial, package number, warranty, and expiration dates. You can also edit item tracking details in consumption and output journals.

To let users enter serial, lot, and package data directly on journal lines, you must enable the capability on item journal batches. To set that up, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Item Journal Templates** page.
1. Select a template of the type Item, Consumption or Output.
1. Choose the **Batches** action to open a list of item journal batches.
1. Choose **New** to create a new batch, and then turn on the **Item Tracking on Lines** toggle.

Repeat these steps for all templates for which you want to use the capability.

After you set the feature up, you can start using it right away.

1. Depending on what you want to do, open the **Item Journals**, **Consumption Journals**, or **Output Journals** pages.
1. In the **Batch Name** field, select the batch for which you enabled the **Item Tracking on Lines** toggle.
1. Choose the **Edit in Excel** action.
1. In Excel, you can now fill in columns, including **Serial No.**, **Lot No.**, **Package No.**, **Expiration Date**, and **Warranty Date**.
1. When you're done, choose **Publish** to send changes to Business Central.end of article

This Copilot feature is available in all supported [Business Central countries/regions](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). However, the feature uses Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, which is currently available for Business Central in some geographies. If your environment is located in a country/region where Azure OpenAI Service isn't available, administrators must allow data to move across geographies. Learn more at [Copilot data movement across geographies](/dynamics365/business-central/ai-copilot-data-movement).

The feature is validated and supported in English. While it can be used in other languages, it might not function as intended. Language quality might vary based on the user's interaction or system settings, which might impact accuracy and the user experience. The quality of answers can also be lower if the language setting for the user in Business Central differs from the primary language of the business data in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] database.

| Report | Description | Id | 
|---------|---------|---------|
| [Assembly BOMs](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=801)|Displays a list of BOMs: name, BOM number, BOM components, and any other BOMs that are part of the BOM. The BOM components are defined in the BOM Component table. You will see here also the unit of measure and the needed quantity of each component per base unit of measure. |801|
| [Item - Able to Make (Time)](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=5871)|Shows how five different key availability figures change over time for a BOM item. These figures change according to expected supply and demand events and to supply that is based on available components that can be assembled or produced.<br>You can use the report to see whether you can fulfill a sales order for an item on a specified date by looking at its current availability in combination with the potential quantities that its components can supply if an assembly order were started. The report shows you when and how many units of an assembly and production item you can make based on component availability and the item’s current availability. This is shown as the total quantity.<br>The information is shown in a graph where each availability figure is a line that progresses along the timeline and moves up and down as quantities change. The quantity figures come from the same engine that provides information to the **Item Availability by BOM Level** window. |5871|
| [BOM Cost Share Distribution](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=5872)|Shows graphically how an assembled or produced item’s cost is distributed through its BOM.<br>Such information can be useful in deciding whether to change component suppliers, replace internal capacity usage with outsourced labor, or vice versa, or when reviewing and modifying an item’s bill of material, for example.<br>The first chart in the report shows the total unit cost of the parent item’s components and labor resources broken down in up to five different cost shares, and represented graphically with different colors.<br>The pie chart with the caption *By Material/Labor* shows the proportional distribution between the parent item’s material and labor costs, as well as its own manufacturing overhead. The material cost share includes the item’s material costs. The labor cost share includes capacity, capacity overhead and subcontracted costs. The cost shares are displayed differently depending on your choices in the **Show only** field.<br>The pie chart with the caption *By Direct/Indirect* shows the proportional distribution between the parent item’s direct and indirect costs. The direct cost share includes the item’s material, capacity, and subcontracted costs. The indirect cost share includes capacity overhead and manufacturing overhead.<br>The table at the bottom of the report is included when you select the Include Details check box. It shows selected values from the BOM Cost Shares window by single level or rolled up, depending on the option that you choose in the Show Cost Shares as field.|5872|
| [Where-used list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=809)|Displays a list of the BOMs that the selected items are components of. A helpful overview in case you must change a component in a BOM that is inserted in an assembly item. For example, if your vendor can no longer deliver a specific item that you used for your assembly/production. In such scenarios, this report provides you with an easy overview of which BOMs the component is included in. You can set a filter for the number of the component.|809|
| [BOM - Raw Materials](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=810)|This report can give you an overview about the needed components, both for assembly and for production. You will see the inventory, base unit of measure, the main vendor if the vendor no. is written in the item card itself, and the lead time calculation.|810|
| [BOM - Sub-Assemblies](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=811)|If you produce and/or assemble sub-assemblies, use this report to get an overview about this type of component. This report shows you the base unit of measure, the inventory, unit costs, and an alternative item number. |811|
| [Assembly BOM - End Items](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=812)|Shows a list of items or BOMs that are not components of BOMs. **Note**: This report is not restricted to BOM only, so remember to set filter in the **Assembly BOM** field or the **Replenishment System** fields|812|
| [Assemble to order - Sales](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=915)|Shows key sales figures for assembly component items that can be sold both as part of an assembly in assemble-to-order sales and as a separate item directly from inventory.<br>Use this report to analyze the quantity, cost, sales, and profit figures of assembly components to support your decisions, such as whether to price a kit differently or to stop or start using a particular item in assemblies.<br>The **In Assembly** row shows sales figures for the total quantity that is sold as part of an assembly item. The specific assembly item sales that sum up to this total are shown if you select the **Show Assembly Details** field.<br>The focus is on the assembly components, but the figures are calculated from the profit margin of their parent, the assembly item. Accordingly, the sales amount of each component is calculated from its own cost and the profit margin of its parent in the following formula.<br>The report shows information for items that meet one or both of the following criteria:<br>- Exist in the assembly BOM of an item that uses the Assemble-to-Order assembly policy.<br>- Has been sold as part of assemble-to-order sale.|915|

If you want to start using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to run your business, you must buy a license. Your administrator can then assign the license to users. However, if you want to convert a 30-day trial company into your actual production company, we encourage all users to sign out of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. Then, once an administrator has assigned the license to your account, the first user who signs into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] must be a user with this license assigned. This way, the 30-day trial ends, and any trial-related notifications disappear so that users can use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to do work.

Increase efficiency in your warehouse with accurate, real-time information about factors that can affect available quantities. For example: 

* Inventory levels
* Locations
* Processing stages
* Quarantined items
* Reservations

You can access information about item availability from the following source documents:

* Sales orders
* Production orders
* Assembly orders
* Jobs

The information also respects other factors that affect availability. For example, dedicated bins, locked bins, and items that aren't available for picking. For example, items might be reserved, or pending put-away or shipment operations. The **Pick Summary** page lets you review the items that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] didn’t include in pick documents and take the necessary actions.

> [!NOTE]
> This capability requires that you turn on the **Directed Put-away and Pick** toggle for the locations you use in your picking process.

### Set up previews

To get details on what's being picked and what isn't, turn on the **Show Summary (Directed Put-away and Pick)** toggle on the **Whse.-Source - Create Document** or **Whse.-Shipment - Create Pick** request pages.

### Determine the quantity you can pick

On lines on the **Create Warehouse Pick Summary** page, the **Qty. to Handle (Base)** field shows which, and how many, items [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] tried to pick. The **Summary** FactBox provides more details.

For simple investigations, the **Pickable Qty.** might give you enough information. The field shows how many items are available. If the pickable quantity is less than expected, explore the bin content.

The **Pickable Qty.** is the maximum quantity that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] can consider for picking. This quantity consists of items in pickable bins. The quantity excludes quantities that are in blocked or dedicated bins, or items that are being picked in warehouse pick documents. If the item you want to pick requires item tracking, blocked lot or serial numbers stored in pickable bins are excluded from the pickable quantity.

If the pickable quantity differs from the quantity in pickable bins, there might be a problem. Explore the bin content to find blocked bins or quantities in active documents.

The **Quantity in Warehouse** field shows the total quantity you'll find in your warehouse if you do a physical count. You can drill down to the warehouse ledger entries from this field. If the field shows a quantity that's less than the quantity in the **Quantity in Pickable Bins**, there's a misalignment between warehouse and inventory quantities. In that case, use the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** action on the **Item Journal** page, and then create the warehouse pick again.

The following image illustrates the maximum quantity considered for picking.

:::image type="content" source="../media/pickable-qty.png" alt-text="Maximum quantity considered for picking.":::

**Legend**

|Letter  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|P     |Bins with content of type Pick​         |
|D     |Bins with content of type Pick marked as Dedicated bins ​       |
|A     |Bins with content of type Pick in the active documents (like another pick)       |
|T     |Bins with content of type Pick with items with blocked tracking​         |
|B     |Bins with content of type Pick with blocked outbound movement​         |
|O     |Other bins         |

### Reservations

If there are reservations for the item being picked, then calculation continues. The idea is that reserved demand has higher priority than non-reserved, which means that picking for non-reserved demand shouldn't prevent picking for reserved demand later.

To verify that your quantity can cover a demand, compare the **Pickable Qty.** value on the **Summary** FactBox with the value in the **Qty. to Handle (Base)** field on the lines.

You can find reservations in the **Total Reserved Qty. in Warehouse** field. Reserved quantities that are already picked and are ready for shipment, usage, or consumption, don't affect availability. The **Reserved Qty. in Pick/Ship Bins** field shows this quantity.

The **Avail. Qty. Excluding Shipment Bin** field shows the quantity that's available, excluding quantities for which the following is true:

* They're already picked for shipments.
* They're in blocked item lots or serial numbers.
* They're in blocked bins.
* They're in dedicated bins.

These quantities might be available, but you might not be able to pick them yet. They could still be in the receipt, storage, or quality-assurance areas. You can move them to the picking area by processing a put-away or movement worksheet.

The difference between **Avail. Qty. Excluding Shipment Bin** and reserved quantity in warehouse is the quantity available for picking without impacting reserved stock.

The following immage illustrates the allocation of available quantity for reserved quanity.

:::image type="content" source="../media/Warehouse_Reservation_Pick.png" alt-text="Maximum quantity considered for picking when reservation involved.":::

**Legend**

|Letter  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|P     |Quantity to pick         |
|TR    |Total Reserved Qty. in Warehouse.  ​       |
|RS    |Reserved quantities that are already picked and are ready for shipment, usage, or consumption       |
|A     |Avail. Qty. Excluding Shipment Bin​         |
|B     |Quantity in dedicated or blocked bins, blocked item lots, or serial numbers         |

While there's enough available quantity in warehouse to satisfy the pick completely, it'll lead to the fact that the total reserved quantity is allocated against the quantities in dedicated or blocked bins, which prevents picking for this demand. Because reserved demand has higher priority, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] reduces the quantity to pick to prevent negative impact, such as the inability to pick, on reserved demand.

### Other details

If items require item tracking, you can also find the quantity in blocked lots or serial numbers, which causes the following reductions:

* The pickable quantity
* Available quantity, excluding the shipment bin
* The reserved quantity in warehouse 

If you pick the same item for multiple source documents or lines, which is also the case when you pick serial numbers, information about picks for other lines also displays because it reduces the pickable quantity.
