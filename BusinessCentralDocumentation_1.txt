# Calculate order promising dates

A company must be able to inform their customers of order delivery dates. The **Order Promising Lines** page enables you to do this from a sales order.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates shipment and delivery dates based on an item’s known and expected availability dates, which you can promise to customers.  

If you specify a requested delivery date on a sales order line, then that date is used as the starting point for the following calculations:  

- requested delivery date - shipping time = planned shipment date  
- planned shipment date - outbound whse. handling time = shipment date  

If the items are available to pick on the shipment date, then the sales process can continue. If the items aren't available to be picked on the shipment date, then a stock-out warning is displayed.  

If you don't specify a requested delivery date on a sales order line, or if the requested delivery date can't be met, then the earliest date on which that the items are available is calculated. That date is then entered in the **Shipment Date** field on the line, and the date on which you plan to ship the items and the date on which they'll be delivered to the customer are calculated using the following calculations:  

- shipment date + outbound whse. handling time = planned shipment date  
- planned shipment date + shipping time = planned delivery date  

## About order promising

The Order Promising functionality enables you to promise an order to be shipped or delivered on a specific date. The date that an item is available to promise or capable to promise is calculated, and order lines are created for those dates that you accept. The functionality calculates the earliest possible date that an item is available for shipment or delivery. It also creates requisition lines, in case the items must first be purchased or produced, for those dates that you accept.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses two fundamental concepts:  

- Available to Promise (ATP)  
- Capable to Promise (CTP)  

### Available to promise

Available to promise (ATP) calculates dates based on the reservation system. It performs an availability check of the unreserved quantities in inventory about planned production, purchases, transfers, and sales returns. Based on this information, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the delivery date of the customer’s order because the items are available, either in inventory or on planned receipts.  

### Capable to promise

Capable to promise (CTP) assumes a “what if” scenario, which only applies to item quantities that aren't in inventory or on scheduled orders. Based on this scenario, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the earliest date that the item can be available if it's to be produced, purchased, or transferred.

#### Example

If there's an order for 10 pieces, and 6 pieces are available in inventory or on scheduled orders, then the capable to promise calculation will be based on 4 pieces.

### Calculations

When [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the customer’s delivery date, it performs two tasks:  

- Calculates the earliest delivery date when the customer hasn't requested a specific delivery date.  
- Verifies if the delivery date requested by the customer or promised to the customer is realistic.  

If the customer doesn't request a specific delivery date, the shipment date is set to equal the work date, and availability is then based on that date. If the item is in inventory, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates forward in time to determine when the order can be delivered. This is accomplished by the following formulas:  

- Shipment Date + Outbound Warehouse Handling Time = Planned Shipment Date  
- Planned Shipment Date + Shipping Time = Planned Delivery Date  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] then verifies if the calculated delivery date is realistic by calculating backward in time to determine when the item must be available to meet the promised date. This is accomplished by the following formulas:  

- Planned Delivery Date - Shipping Time = Planned Shipment Date  
- Planned Shipment Date - Outbound Warehouse Handling = Shipment Date  

The shipment date is used to make the availability check. If the item is available on this date, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] confirms that the requested/promised delivery can be met by setting the planned delivery date to equal the requested/promised delivery date. If the item is unavailable, it returns a blank date and the order processor can then use the CTP functionality.  

Based on new dates and times, all related dates are calculated according to the formulas listed earlier in this section. The CTP calculation takes longer but it gives an accurate date when the customer can expect to have the item delivered. The dates that are calculated from CTP are presented in the **Planned Delivery Date** and **Earliest Shipment Date** fields on the **Order Promising Lines** page.  

The order processor finishes the CTP process by accepting the dates. This means that a planning line and a reservation entry are created for the item before the calculated dates to ensure that the order is fulfilled.  

In addition to the external order promising that you can perform on the **Order Promising Lines** page, you can also promise internal or external delivery dates for bill-of-material items. For more information, see [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md).

## To set up order promising

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Order Promising Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Enter a number and time unit code in the **Offset(Time)** field. Select one of the following codes.  

    |Code|Description|  
    |----------|-----------------|  
    |**d**|Calendar day|  
    |**w**|Week|  
    |**m**|Month|  
    |**q**|Quarter|  
    |**y**|Year|  

    For example, "3w" indicates that the offset time is three weeks. To indicate the current period, prefix to any of these codes with the letter “c”. For example, if you want the offset time to be the current month, enter **cm**.  
3. Enter a number series in the **Order Promising Nos.** field by selecting a line from the list on the **No. Series** page.  
4. Enter an order promising template in the **Order Promising Template** field by selecting a line from the list on the **Req. Worksheet Template List** page.  
5. Enter a requisition worksheet in the **Order Promising Worksheet** field by selecting a line from the list on the **Req. Wksh. Names** page.

### Inbound and outbound warehouse handling times in order promising

If you want to include warehouse handling time in the order promising calculation on the purchase line, on the **Inventory Setup** page you can specify a default handling time to use on sales and purchase documents. You can also enter specific times for each of your locations on the **Location Card** page. 

#### To enter default inbound and outbound warehouse handling times for sales and purchase documents

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Inbound Whse. Handling Time** and **Outbound Whse. Handling Time** fields, enter the number of days that you want to include in the order promising calculations.  

#### To enter inbound and outbound warehouse handling times on locations

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Location**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the relevant location card.  
3.  On the **Warehouse** FastTab, in the **Inbound Whse. Handling Time** and **Outbound Whse. Handling Time** fields, enter the number of days that you want to be included in the order promising calculations.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  When you are creating a purchase order, if you choose **Location** in the **Ship-to** field on the **Shipping and Payment** FastTab, and then choose a location in the **Location Code** field, the **Outbound Whse. Handling Time** and **Inbound Whse. Handling Time** fields will use the handling time specified for the location. For sales orders, the same is true if you choose a location in the **Location Code** field. If no handling time is specified for the location, the **Outbound Whse. Handling Time** and **Inbound Whse. Handling Time** fields will be blank. If you leave the **Location Code** field blank on sales and purchase documents, the calculation uses the handling time specified on the **Inventory Setup**  page.

## To make an item critical

Before an item can be included in the order promising calculation, it must be marked as critical. This setup ensures that non-critical items don't cause irrelevant order promising calculations.   
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the relevant item card.  
3.  On the **Planning** FastTab, select the **Critical** field.  

## To calculate an order promising date

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the relevant sales order and select the sales order lines that you want application to calculate.  
3.  Choose the **Order Promising** action, and then choose the **Order Promising Lines** action.  
4.  Select a line, and then select one of the following options:  

    - Select **Available-to-Promise** if you want to calculate the earliest date that the item will be available with respect to inventory, scheduled receipts, and gross requirements.  
    - Select **Capable-to-Promise** if you know that the item is presently out of stock and you want to calculate the earliest date that the item can be available by issuing new replenishment requisitions.  
5.  Choose the **Accept** button to accept the earliest shipment date available.

# Understanding the Chart of Accounts

A chart of accounts (COA) serves as a comprehensive directory of financial accounts and their corresponding reference numbers. A COA typically has of two main categories of accounts:

* Balance sheet accounts: These accounts track your company’s assets, debts, and net worth.
* Income statement accounts: These accounts record income from various sources and also track expenses.

Balance sheet accounts are further categorized into three groups:

* Asset accounts: These accounts track all the valuable resources owned by your company.
* Liability accounts: They record your company’s debts.
* Equity accounts: Represent the residual value in the business after subtracting liabilities from assets.

Income accounts are divided into two groups:

* Revenue accounts: These accounts capture your company’s income from various sources.
* Expense accounts: These accounts capture all your company’s expenses.

Use the COA to record transactions in your organization’s general ledger. Each account typically has an identifier (account number) and a descriptive caption or header, and they're systematically coded based on their account type.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a standard chart of accounts that is ready to support your business.

The composition of your company’s chart of accounts is a strategic decision made by your management (or by country-specific regulation). It varies based on your company’s industry, business model, and financial structure. For instance, depending on your industry, you might have specific asset accounts tailored to your company's unique operations and needs:

* A retail business might emphasize inventory and accounts receivable.
* A technology company might focus on intangible assets like patents and software.
* A manufacturing plant would track fixed assets and supplies.

## The chart of accounts page

The chart of accounts shows all general ledger accounts. From the chart of accounts, you can do things like:  

* View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.  
* Close your income statement.  
* Open the General Ledger Account Card, where you can add or change settings.  
* See a list of posting groups for that account.
* View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

You can add, change, or delete general ledger accounts. However, to prevent discrepancies, you can't delete a general ledger account if its data is used in the chart of accounts. Also, you can block the accidental deletion of accounts in sensitive periods. To learn more about protecting accounts from deletion, go to [Deleting accounts](finance-setup-chart-accounts.md#delete-accounts).  

## The code hierarchy in G/L accounts

Businesses typically create a hierarchical structure in G/L account codes to reflect where they belong in the chart of accounts. For instance, in some implementations, G/L account codes that start with **1** denotes asset accounts, whereas G/L account codes that start with 3 denotes equity accounts. In some regions, there are local regulations for using a standard chart of accounts. To help users understand this hierarchy without the need to know the internal code structure, you can define headers and subtotals in your chart of accounts that encapsulate these internal structures.

## Designing your chart of accounts

Each line in the chart of accounts is a G/L account of one of the types:

* Posting (journals can post lines to these accounts)
* Heading (defines an overall heading in the chart of accounts)
* Total (defines a formula for a subtotal in the chart of accounts)
* Begin-Total (defines a beginning heading for a subtotal in the chart of accounts. All subsequent lines until an End-Total line are indented)
* End-Total (defines an ending heading for a subtotal and the formula for it in the chart of accounts. All subsequent lines after this End-Total line are outdented)

A minimalist chart of accounts can consist of only lines of posting accounts. You use the other four types to define how the chart of accounts also shows a financial statement with headers and subtotals. Totaling accounts are frequently used in financial reporting.

> [!TIP]
> If you use account types other than **Posting** in your chart of accounts, you can define different views to show the "raw" posting accounts without the reporting-type account types for totalling and headings. For example, Show only posting accounts and Hide blocked accounts.

## Use dimensions to simplify your chart of accounts

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from. So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department and project, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts.

To learn more about dimensions, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

## Organize general ledger (G/L) data using account categories

The **G/L Account Categories** page lets you create simple financial reports based on your chart of accounts.  

By providing categories, subcategories, and account mapping to your chart of accounts, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes basic financial reporting out of the box. If you're just getting started with financial reporting, the standard reports are excellent options until you become more experienced.

For more information, see [Organize general ledger (G/L) data using account categories](bi-account-categories.md).

## Get a quick overview of your finances

The **Chart of Accounts** page displays accounts in a hierarchical list that offers fast access to the key information for each account. However, the list is static, and if you have many accounts, you might have to scroll to view different accounts. If you just want a quick overview of the basics, such as net changes and balances, the **Chart of Accounts Overview** page is a useful alternative. The column layout on the page is the same as the **Chart of Accounts** page (though with fewer columns), so it's easy to understand. You can expand or collapse the hierarchical levels. To make it easy to switch between the pages, the **Chart of Accounts Overview** page is available from the **Chart of Accounts** page.

## Access to create and edit the chart of accounts

In a small organization, such as the CRONUS demonstration company, most users can edit the chart of accounts, except those users with a TEAM MEMBER license. However, larger organizations typically use roles and permissions to limit access to editing the chart of accounts. If you're an administrator, or have the Business Manager or Accountant role, you can control user permissions to give the right people access to the relevant tables. To learn more, go to [Get an overview of a user's permissions](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#get-an-overview-of-a-users-permissions).  

## Audit changes to G/L accounts setup

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your G/L accounts. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)] 

The following table lists the table for G/L accounts and its ID.

| Table | Table ID |
| ----- | -------- |
| G/L Account | 15 |

[!INCLUDE [include-audit-changes-to-setup-learn-more-link](includes/include-audit-changes-to-setup-learn-more-link.md)]



<!-- ## Standard chart of accounts in different regions
Uncomment when we have more examples added to our localization documentation

Some regions have defined standards for the chart of accounts structure you should use in your company. 

Here are some examples of such standards that have been implemented in localized versions of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

* [Standard chart of accounts in Denmark](localfunctionality/denmark/how-to-set-up-standard-coa.md)
-->

## Chart of accounts best practices

Here are some best practices that you might consider when you develop and maintaining your charts of accounts:

* Compose your company’s chart of accounts to support the financial reporting needs for your management to take strategic decisions.
* Consider starting simple with fewer G/L accounts. You can always add more detailed accounts if needed.
* Define headers and subtotals in your chart of accounts that summarize the internal structures in G/L accounts.
* Use dimensions to simplify your chart of accounts. Don't have specific G/L accounts for each product or department.
* Add new G/L accounts as they come in, but remove accounts from your chart of accounts only during period-end of your finance period.

# Changing your language and region settings

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available in many markets and languages, and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers features to help companies comply with local regulatory requirements. You can use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in different languages, and can change the language for display texts. If you change your language setting, sign out and sign in again to apply the change. The new setting applies only to you, and not to everyone else in your company.  

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

For example, you're using the Canadian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in English, German, French, or another language, but it's still the Canadian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. It isn't the same as [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Germany, where features are adapted for German requirements.  

To change the language of the user interface, go to the **My Settings** page. To learn more, go to [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md#language).

> [!NOTE]  
> The choice of languages resets to your setting on your Microsoft 365 profile if your administrator synchronizes users from Microsoft 365 to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can't change the texts that are stored as application data. Examples of such texts are the names of items in inventory, or the comments for a customer. In other words, these types of text aren't translated.  

> [!NOTE]  
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only supports a single character set for data. Some characters might not be supported in your environment. You might experience problems when you try to view data that was entered using a different character set. For instance, your environment might support only English and Russian characters. In this case, if you enter data in a different language, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might not store it correctly. Contact your system administrator to make sure you understand which languages are supported by your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Changing your region setting

Region is different from both language and legal requirements in local markets. Region determines how your data presents itself, such as the decimal separator, and how text aligns to the left or right. The region also determines some of the system elements in the browser, such as the action to create a new item in a list.  

You can change the region in the browser tab that you're using to work in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The change applies only to you and not to the other users in your company. The choice of region is reset to your setting on your Microsoft 365 profile if your administrator synchronizes users from Microsoft 365 into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you change the region, you'll see a long list of languages and regions. However, the language isn't influenced by the choice of region.  

To change the region, go to the **My Settings** page. To learn more, go to [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).  

## Changing the region setting for customers, contacts, and vendors

Some businesses use an external service that validates address information in their country or region. However, when you need to update address information, the structured approach that these services use might not always be what's right for some scenarios. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a more flexible means of entering address details.

On the **General Ledger Setup** page, if you turn on the **Require Country/Region Code in Address** toggle, changes to the **Country/Region Code** field on addresses for customers, contacts, or vendors resets the values in other address fields.

## Custom address formats for countries/regions

The countries and regions in which you do business might have different formats for addresses. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] lets you customize the format in which postal addresses show for each region. To define a custom format, on the **Countries/Regions** page, choose the **Custom Address Format** action. You can adjust the order of the address information by using the **Move Up** and **Move Down** actions. To change the field on a line, in the **Field ID** field, choose :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The assist edit icon.":::, and then choose the field.

In some cases, you might need to add multiple fields on a line. By default, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] lets you combine the city, postal code, and country. To add multiple fields on a line, enter **0** in the **Field ID** field, and then choose the value in the **Line Format** field to open the **Custom Address Format Lines** page. Add a new line for each piece of information.

## Application version

# Sign up for a free Dynamics 365 Business Central trial

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a free trial. There are two ways to access the trial version, depending on your location. If you are in a country where Microsoft offers official localization, you can follow one path. If you are in a country where localization is handled by partners, you'll need to follow a different path. Explore the different types of localization [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). After a quick sign-up, you'll have access to many of the app's key features. The trial allows you to test the app with sample data. If you want to try out things with your own data, you'll switch to a free 30-day trial. [Learn more about Business Central features](across-business-functionality.md).  

## Start the trial in Microsoft-based localizations 

You can find your free [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] trial on the **[Dynamics 365 Business Central product](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/products/business-central)** page. You just need to follow the steps and you'll get trial localized version tailored for your location. If you want eventually to try different localization, you can do it in the sandbox. 

<!--## To sign up for the trial-->

[!INCLUDE [trial-get](includes/trial-get.md)]

## Start with the trial in location with partner-based localizations  

In countries where Microsoft doesn't offer built-in localization, obtaining a localized version by default isn't possible due to localization being managed by partners. Consequently, Microsoft can only provide the standard base app, typically without localization or translation. To avoid confusion not offering all local requirements and the language, we have different path of getting trial version, so you can have full local experience.  

You can get your trial version following these steps:

1. You must run "Find your partner" on [Microsoft web site](https://partner.microsoft.com/partnership/find-a-partner) or ask local Microsoft office for advice. 
2. Microsoft can help you find a partner for you or you might have already found a partner based on your experience. 
3. You might offer your partner for the trial version and then partner goes to CSP.  
   1. Finds or adds customer tenant.   
   2. Assigns the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Trial SKU in CSP. 
   3. Assigns the localization and translation, and eventually assigns translated demo data to the created tenant. 
   4. Sends customer link to the environment.   
   5. The test trial environment will be accessible. 

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft doesn't oversee how partners set up the trial environment or what specific elements are included. While Microsoft offers recommendations, partners have the flexibility to implement them in their own way. Using a trial version from one partner doesn't obligate you to purchase a license from them, and you can always choose to switch partners at any time.  

## What to try

Your trial environment includes the same features as the paid version. The links below guide you through some of the key features.

- [Overview of business functionality](across-business-functionality.md)  
- [Get started](ui-get-ready-business.md#get-started)  
- [Get productive](ui-work-product.md)  
- [Quick starts](quick-start-business-central.md)  

## Get started with a subscription

Each time you sign in during the trial period, a notification in a blue bar at the top displays the time remaining. If you decide to subscribe, find a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner. For more information, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](/dynamics365/business-central/across-faq#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner). The reselling partner can help you set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to fit your business, including importing your data from your previous system. You can also customize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by adding apps from [the Microsoft commercial marketplace](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646).  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online uses Microsoft 365. If your company uses a different type of email setup, the reselling partner can help you decided how to migrate, or if you should use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.  

You can also contact the [[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Sales team](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=828707).

# Setting up service management
Before you can start using Service Management features in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], there are a few things to set up. For example, you can establish coding for standard services, symptoms, and fault codes, and the service items and service item types based on your company’s customer service requirements.  

When you set up Service Management, you must decide what services to offer customers and the schedule for those services. A service is a type of work performed by one or more resources and provided to a customer. For example, a service could be a type of computer repair. A service item is the equipment or item needing servicing, for example, the computer needing repair, installed at a specific customer. You can set up services as part of a group of related repair or maintenance items.  
  
When you define a service, you can associate it with the skills required to perform the service. To help your service representatives be efficient, you can also set up real time troubleshooting guidelines and assign typical startup costs, such as travel costs or other fees.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# The QuickBooks Payroll file import extension
Use the QuickBooks Payroll File Import extension to import payroll transactions from QuickBooks to general ledger accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this is useful when you're transitioning from QuickBooks to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or if you outsource your payroll but also want to keep track of it in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Steps to import payroll data
The first step is for you, or maybe your accountant, to use the export features in QuickBooks to export the payroll data to an .IIF file. The second step is to open the **General Journals** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and use the **Import Payroll Transactions** action to import the file. During the import process, you map the general ledger accounts from QuickBooks to corresponding accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The final step is to post the payroll transactions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] according to the account mapping. 

For more information, see [Import Payroll Transactions](finance-how-import-payroll-transactions.md).

# Design your own financial reports

You can use financial reporting to create custom reports. For example, if you want more complex reports.

To create a new financial report, choose the **New** action. You can then give the report a name and add a description. Afterward, you can specify default settings for the report, such as:

* **Row Definition**
* **Column Definition**
* **Analysis Views**

## Copy an existing report

To copy an existing report, use the **Copy Financial Report** action. When you choose this option, you can rename the copied report. You can also copy and rename individual row definitions and column definitions.  

## Create your own row definition

To create your own row definition, choose **Edit Row Definition**. To explore existing row definitions, choose the **Name** field. Choose **New**, and give the row definition a name and description.

You now have a blank row definition that you can use to build your new report.  

> [!TIP]
> Take a moment to personalize your screen to show only the **Row No.**, **Description**, **Totaling Type**, **Totaling**, **Row Type**, and **Bold** columns. These columns are recommended as the minimum columns needed for a basic row definition. There are many columns available, which can be used as you become familiar with creating more advanced financial reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

When getting started with financial reporting, there are a few choices we recommended in fields. The following table describes the recommended choices.

|Field  |Option  |
|---------|---------|
|Row No.     |Alpha, numeric, or alphanumeric codes are used here to identify rows in formulas.         |
|Description  |Specifies the words to label each row of the report.         |
|Totaling Type    |The **Posting Accounts** and **Formulas** options are often used.         |
|Totaling     | Together with the **Totaling Type** of **Posting Accounts**, maps general ledger accounts to the report, either individually or in ranges.<br><br> Together with **Totaling Type** of the **Formula**, uses row references to the **Row No.** field to do basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.          |
|Row Type     |**Net Change** is used for income statement reports.<br><br>**Balance at Date** is used for balance sheet reports.<br><br>**Beginning Balance** is used for cash flow statements.          |
|Bold     |  Simple formatting to apply to headers, subtotals, and other elements of the report that you want to emphasize.       |

## When to show the opposite sign in rows and columns

Use the **Show Opposite Sign** option to show the opposite sign in a credit balance account, such as revenue, for reports you present to people who aren't accountants.

> [!TIP]
> It's important to remember that you should use the **Show Opposite Sign** option on the posting account line for the account where the sign needs to be flipped. If you use the option on a formula such as gross margin, where both revenue and cost of goods sold are represented, the calculation will be incorrect. Pay extra attention when you use the setting in formulas.

## Create your own column definition

To create your own column definition, choose **Edit Column Definition**. To explore existing definitions, choose the **Name** field. Choose **New**, and give the new column definition a name and a description.

You now have a blank column definition that you can use to build your new report.  

> [!TIP]
> Take a moment to personalize your screen to show only the **Column No.**, **Column Header**, **Column Type**, **Ledger Entry Type**, **Budget Name**, **Formula**, and **Comparison Period Formula** columns. These columns are recommended as the minimum needed for a basic column definition. There are many columns available, which you can use as you become more familiar with creating advanced financial reports.

When getting started with financial reporting, there are a few field choices we recommended. The following table describes the recommendations.

|Field  |Option  |
|---------|---------|
|Column No.     |Alpha, numeric, or alphanumeric codes are used here to identify columns in formulas.         |
|Column Header     |Used to hold the words used to label each column of the report.         |
|Column Type     |The often used options are **Net Change**, **Balance at Date**, and **Formula**.<br><br>**Net Change** is used for income statement reports.<br><br>**Balance at Date** is used for balance sheet reports.<br><br>**Formula** uses row references to Column No. to do basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.          |
|Ledger Entry Type     |Entries are used for general ledger entries.<br><br>**Budget Entries** are used for budget entry comparisons.         |
|Budget Name     |When using budget entries, select the budget to use.         |
|Formula     | Formula uses row references to Column No. to do basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.        |
|Comparison Period Formula     | Holds various period-related formulas that determine the period for the report combined with the date filter.        |

## When to use a comparison period formula and comparison date formula in a column definition

There are two options for column definition comparisons for accounting periods:

* Comparison period formula
* Comparison date formula

Comparison period formula is often used for reports that show monthly, quarterly, or annual accounting periods. In most cases, financial reports use these increments of time.  

Comparison date formula is typically used for reports that show weekly or daily accounting periods. These increments of time are appropriate for operational reporting, such as daily sales or weekly invoicing.

### Column definitions that include budgets

Budgets can be included on any report when included on the column definition. By selecting a ledger entry type of **Budget Entries**, and entering the **Budget Name** for the selected budget, you can easily show comparisons of actual to budget in reports.

# The Ceridian Payroll Extension

To account for salary payments and related transactions, you must import and post financial transactions made by your payroll provider to the general ledger.

To do this, you first import a file that you receive from the payroll provider into the **General Journal** page. Then you map the external accounts in the payroll file to the relevant G/L accounts. Lastly, you post the payroll transactions according to the account mapping. For more information, see [Import Payroll Transactions](finance-how-import-payroll-transactions.md).

The Ceridian Payroll extension allows you to import payroll transactions from the Ceridian HR/Payroll (US) and Ceridian PowerPay (Canada) services.

# Moving Items

You can move items in your warehouse in different ways, depending on how you've configured your warehouse. The complexity can vary:

* Small warehouses might use basic warehouse configurations to handle orders individually, in a single or multiple steps.
* Large warehouses might use advanced configurations where all warehouse activities are coordinated by a directed workflow. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

Items may need to be moved between bins, for example, due to internal operations:

* A production order needs components delivered, or its finished items put away.
* A warehouse manager wants to optimize space.
* Unplanned movements to and from operations.
* Replenish picking bins or shop floor bins.
* Update bin contents.

Counting, adjusting, and reclassifying items can involve warehouse tasks that must be performed on warehouse entries before they can be synchronized with item ledger entries. Learn more at [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md).  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Design Details: Item Tracking Availability
The **Item Tracking Lines** and **Item Tracking Summary** pages provide dynamic availability information for serial or lot numbers. The purpose of this is to increase transparency for users on outbound documents, such as sales orders, by showing them which serial numbers or how many units of a lot number are currently assigned on other open documents. This reduces uncertainty that is caused by double allocation and instills confidence in order processors that the item tracking numbers and dates that they are promising on unposted sales orders can be fulfilled. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Tracking Lines Page](design-details-item-tracking-lines-window.md).  

 When you open the **Item Tracking Lines** page, availability data is retrieved from the **Item Ledger Entry** table and the **Reservation Entry** table, with no date filter. When you choose the **Serial No.** field or the **Lot No.** field, the **Item Tracking Summary** page opens and shows a summary of the item tracking information in the **Reservation Entry** table. The summary contains the following information about each serial or lot number on the item tracking line:  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Total Quantity**|The total quantity of the serial or lot number that is currently in inventory.|  
|**Total Requested Quantity**|The total quantity of the serial or lot number that is currently requested in all documents.|  
|**Current Pending Quantity**|The quantity that is entered in the current instance of the **Item Tracking Lines** page but is not yet committed to the database.|  
|**Total Available Quantity**|The quantity of the serial or lot number that is available for the user to request.<br /><br /> This quantity is calculated from other fields on the page as follows:<br /><br /> total quantity – (total requested quantity + current pending quantity).|  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You can also see the information in the preceding table by using the **Select Entries** function on the **Item Tracking Lines** page.  

 To preserve database performance, availability data is only retrieved once from the database when you open the **Item Tracking Lines** page and when you use the **Refresh Availability** function on the page.  

## Calculation Formula  
 As described in the preceding table, the availability of a given serial or lot number is calculated as follows.  

 total available quantity = quantity in inventory – (all demands + quantity not yet committed to the database)  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  This formula implies that the serial or lot number availability calculation considers only inventory and ignores projected receipts. Accordingly, supply that is not yet posted to inventory does not affect item tracking availability, as opposed to regular item availability where projected receipts are included.

# Why a Page is Locked from Personalization

There are two conditions that prevent you from personalizing a page. Either the page is locked (as indicated by the ![Personalize Lock.](media/personalization-lock-icon.png "Personalize lock")) icon or it's blocked (as indicated by the ![Personalization blocked.](media/personalization-blocked-icon.png "Personalization blocked") icon).

## Locked from Personalizing

If there's a ![Personalize Lock.](media/personalization-lock-icon.png "Personalize lock") icon in the **Personalizing** banner when you open a page, you're currently prevented from making any more personalization changes to the page.

<!-- This is because we changed the way personalization works behind the scenes since the last time that you personalized the page. Unfortunately, the old way and new of doing things do not work together.

The page currently includes the last personalization changes that you made. If you want to continue personalizing the page, then you can choose the lock icon and then **Unlock**. Just be aware that if you choose to unlock the page, the current personalization of the page will be cleared, and you will have to start from scratch.
-->

There can be two reasons:

1. You've personalized the page before, but it was done using an earlier version of the product. We changed the way personalization works behind the scenes since the last time that you personalized the page. Unfortunately, the old way and new way of doing things don't work together.

2. Until now, you've only used the bow deprecated [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] to personalize the page.

### Unlocking the Page

If you want to unlock a page and continue personalizing it, choose the ![Personalize Lock](media/personalization-lock-icon.png "Personalize lock") icon, and then choose the **Unlock** action.  

> [!CAUTION]
> The current personalization of the page will be cleared. The page will go back to its original layout, and you'll have to start from scratch.  

## Blocked from Personalizing

If there's a ![Personalization blocked](media/personalization-blocked-icon.png "Personalization blocked") icon in the **Personalizing** banner, you're blocked from doing any personalization to the page.

<!-- Only text is translated, so removing this image for non-English UX reasons.  ![Personalize blocked.](media/personalization-blocked.png "Personalize lock") -->

The reason is that the Role Center or role that is currently associated with your user account modifies this page specifically for your role. Contact your administrator for assistance. Alternatively, try switching to a Role Center that does include role-tailoring for this page. For more information, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).

# Set Up Finance Charge Terms

When a customer does not pay by the due date, you can have finance charges calculated automatically and add them to the overdue amounts on the customer's account. You can inform customers of the added charges by sending finance charge memos. But first, you must set up a code that represents each finance charge calculation. Then you can enter this code in the Fin. Charge Terms Code field on customer cards.  

## Finance charge terms

You must set up finance charge terms for each finance charge calculation, and then assign the terms to the customer in the **Fin. Charge Terms Code** field on the **Customer** page.

Finance charges can be calculated using either the average daily balance or the balance due methods.

* Average daily balance  
  
  The number of days the payment is overdue is taken into account:  
  *Average Daily Balance method* - *Finance Charge* = *Overdue Amount* x *(Days Overdue / Interest Period)* x *(Interest Rate/100)*

* Balance due  
  
  The finance charge is a percentage of the overdue amount:  
  *Balance Due method* - *Finance Charge* = *Overdue Amount* x *(Interest Rate / 100)*

Additionally, each term in the Finance Charge Terms table is linked to a subtable, the Finance Charge Text table. For each set of finance charge terms, you can define a beginning and/or an ending text to include on the finance charge memo.

### To set up finance charge terms

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Finance Charge Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.
3. To use more than one combination of finance charge terms, set up a code for each one.

    For each finance charge term, you can specify individual conditions that can include additional fees in both LCY and in foreign currency. You can define additional fees in foreign currencies for each term on the **Finance Charge Terms** page.
4. Choose the **Currencies** action.
5. On the **Currencies for Fin. Chrg. Terms** page, define for each term a currency code and an additional fee.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you create finance charges in a foreign currency, the foreign currency conditions that you set up here will be used to create finance charge memos. If there are no foreign currency finance charge conditions set up, the LCY finance charge conditions specified on the **Finance Charge Terms** page will be used and then converted to the relevant currency.

    For each finance charge term, you can specify text that will be printed before (**Beginning Text**) or after (**Ending Text**) on the entries on the finance charge memo.  
6. Choose the **Beginning Text** or **Ending Text** actions respectively, and fill on the **Finance Charge Text** page.
7. To automatically insert related values in the resulting finance charge text, enter the following placeholders in the **Text** field.

|Placeholder|Value|  
|-----------------|-----------|  
|%1|Content of the **Document Date** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%2|Content of the **Due Date** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%3|Content of the **Interest Rate** field on the related finance charge terms|  
|%4|Content of the **Remaining Amount** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%5|Content of the **Interest Amount** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%6|Content of the **Additional Fee** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%7|The total amount of the reminder|  
|%8|Content of the **Currency Code** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%9|Content of the **Posting Date** field on the finance charge memo header|

# Allocate Costs to Intercompany Partners
When you use intercompany postings to transfer documents between partner companies, the VAT-related settings (primarily the VAT business posting group) assigned to the customer or vendor accounts (associated with the intercompany Partner) control whether, and how, VAT is calculated and registered. 
You can also do cost distributions directly from a purchase order to partner companies. For example, if you register a purchase invoice from an external vendor and you want to distribute some or all of the costs to one or more intercompany partners.

You can allocate costs can be to one or more intercompany partners using the following:

* **Intercompany General Journals** - These journals are useful when a service is purchased. For example, when a parent company hires a service to set up computer systems in two subsidiaries. The invoice is sent to the parent company, but the costs are allocate to the intercompany partners. For more information, see [Work with Intercompany Documents and Journals](intercompany-how-work-documents-journals.md).
* Purchase orders and invoices - Using purchase documents is useful when the purchasing functions of, for example, operating expenses, are centralized in one company and then allocated to the intercompany partners.

## To allocate costs using an intercompany general journal
To enter a  line in an intercompany general journal, follow these steps. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany General Journal** , and then choose the related link.
2. If required, in the **External Document No.** field, enter the document number on the invoice from the vendor.
3. In the **Document Type** field, choose **Invoice**.
4. In the **Account Type** field, choose **Vendor**.
5. In the **Account No.** field, choose the vendor.
6. In the **Amount** field, enter a negative amount equal to the amount on the invoice.
7. In the **Bal. Account Type** field, choose **G/L Account**.
8. In the **Bal. Account No.** field, choose the balancing account to use.
9. To allocate costs to intercompany partners, follow these steps:
   1. Create a new line.
   2. Leave the **Document Type** field, choose the option that leaves the field blank.
   3. In the **Document No.** field, enter a number that is different than the number in the **External Document No.** field. The cost allocation is considered a different transaction.
   4. In the **Account Type** field, choose **IC Partner**.
   5. In the **Account No.** field, choose the intercompany partner to allocate the cost to.
   6. In the **Balance Account Type** field, choose **G/L Account**.
   7. In the **Balance Account No.** field, choose the G/L account to which to post the amount you receive from the intercompany partner.
   1. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount of the invoice to allocate to the intercompany partner.
   1. In the **IC Partner G/L Acc. No.** field, choose the G/L account that you want to post the amount to for the intercompany partner. 
   1. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Repeat these steps for each intercompany partner who should share in the cost.
1. To post the document and allocate the costs, choose **Post**.  

## To allocate costs using a purchase document
The following procedure describes how to allocate costs using a purchase invoice. The steps are the same for purchase orders.

> [!NOTE]
> To complete these steps you must personalize the **Purchase Invoice** page by adding the **IC Partner Code**, **IC Partner Ref. Type**, and **IC Partner** fields. For more information, see [To start personalizing a page through the Personalizing banner](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoice** , and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Type** field, choose **G/L Account**.
   
   G/L Account is the only option you can use to allocate costs.  
1. In the **No.** field, choose the G/L account to post to.
1. In the **IC Partner Code** field, choose the intercompany partner to allocate the cost to.
1. In the **IC Partner Ref. Type** choose the G/L account to use for the allocation. This account will map the expense to an account in the intercomany partner's chart of accounts.
1. In the **Quantity** field, specify the number of units to charge to the intercompany partner.
1. In the **Direct Unit Cost Excl. VAT (or Incl. VAT)** field, enter the cost per item to charge to the intercompany partner.
1. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] 
1. To post the purchase order, choose **Post**.

## To send the allocated costs to intercompany partners
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **IC Outbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose lines to send, and then choose the **Send to IC Partner** action. 
3. To allocate the costs, choose the **Complete Line Actions** action.

## Calculating VAT for Cost Distributions
When you use a document to distribute costs to intercompany partners, there are two VAT settings to be aware of: 
* The settings on the G/L account for expenses:
   * If the general business or VAT business posting groups are set up on the G/L account, then the calculation depends on the groups and the product groups from the document line.
   * If the general business or VAT business posting groups are not specified on the G/L account, the calculation depends on the following:
* The posting group settings on the intercompany partner
   * Whether the intercompany partner is assigned to a customer number that does not have a general business or VAT business posting groups specified.
   * There is no customer number associated with the intercompany partner. Then the general business or VAT business posting groups are blank, and the line in the VAT posting setup is used, which is usually a group where 0% VAT is specified.

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to validate both the intercompany partner setup and the G/L account setup (for the expense account used for the cost distribution) before you allocate costs to intercompany partners.

# Sustainability value chain in transfers

To use the sustainability value chain with transfer orders, you must enable the **Enable Value Chain Tracking** field on the **Sustainability Setup** page.  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Check whether the basic setup already exists. If it doesn't, follow [these instructions](finance-sustainability-setup.md) to set it up.  
3. On the **Procurement** FastTab, select the **Enable Value Chain tracking** field.
4. Close the page.

## Work with transfer orders  

To learn how to work with transfer orders, go to [To transfer items with a transfer order](inventory-how-transfer-between-locations.md#to-transfer-items-with-a-transfer-order).  

To use transfer orders in the sustainability value chain process, you must add the carbon equivalent (CO2e) emission that you produce in the transfer process. For example, if you transfer goods by truck. You can add it in the **Total CO2e** field for each line on a transfer order. The value is the total emissions for the item quantities on the lines.

After you post a transfer order, you can find entries related to the transfer on the **Posted Transfer Shipment** page. To find the entries, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted transfer shipments**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the **Posted Transfer Shipment** you want to check, and then choose the **Find entries** action.
3. On the **Find entries** page, choose **Sustainability Value Entry** to review the transactions related to this document.
4. Close the page.

> [!NOTE]
> Regardless of whether you select the **Direct Transfer** field on the **Transfer Order** page, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates sustainability value entries only for transactions related to the posted transfer shipment. The transactions increase the **CO2e per Unit** value for transferred items using the average method.

# Project analytics

Businesses capture lots of data during daily activities that supports business intelligence (BI) for project managers, such as:

- Cost performance for projects
- Completion rates for projects
- Financial data for projects

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's project data:

- Power BI reports for projects
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using Open in Excel)
- Built-in project analytics tools
- Built-in project reports

Each of these features has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data analysis and the role of the user. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to gain insights into your projects.

## Analytics needs in projects

When you think about the analytics needs in projects management, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes different analytics needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use the data in different ways. For example, people in project management interact with data differently than people in finance.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role  | Data aggregation | Typical ways to consume data          | 
|------------------- |-------------------| ---------------------- |
|COO / CFO / CEO | Performance data  | KPIs, dashboards, financial reports               |
|Project Manager     | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports, ad-hoc analysis      |
|Project participant | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports, on-screen task data |

## Using Power BI to monitor project KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In project management, people often use the following KPIs to monitor project performance:

- % Complete
- % Invoiced
- Realization %
- Actual Profit
- Actual Profit Margin %
- Actual (Total Cost)
- Budget (Total Cost)

:::image type="content" source="media/projects/project-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Projects Overview Power BI Report" lightbox="media/projects/project-overview.png":::

These KPIs (and more) are available for projects in the Project Power BI app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

To learn more, go to [Power BI Projects app](projects-powerbi-app.md).

### Reports in the Power BI Projects app

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-projects-app](includes/power-bi-projects-app.md)]

To learn more, go to [Power BI Projects app](projects-powerbi-app.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of project data

Sometimes, you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data Analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **Project Ledger Entries**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

> [!TIP]
> If you configure OneDrive for system features, the Excel workbook opens in your browser.

## Built-in reports for projects

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports to help project organizations report on their data.

[!INCLUDE [report-explorer-projects](includes/report-explorer-projects.md)]

To learn more about reports that are relevant for project management, go to [Built-in project reports](project-reports.md).

## On-screen project analytics

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you project overviews and tasks to do, such as:

- [Monitor project progress and performance](projects-how-monitor-progress-performance.md)

# Set up and report Intrastat

All companies in the European Union must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. You must report the movement of goods to the statistics authorities in your country/region every month, and the report must be delivered to the tax authorities. This is referred to as Intrastat Reporting. You use the **Intrastat Journal** page to complete periodic Intrastat reports.

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

## Required and optional Setups

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customer cards and Vendor cards include a field, **Intrastat Partner Type**, that has the same option values as the **Partner Type** field: *"" (blank)*, *Company*, and *Person*. The **Intrastat Partner Type** field has replaced the **Partner Type** field in Intrastat reporting. **Partner Type** is used in SEPA to define the SEPA Direct Debit Scheme (Core or B2B). **Intrastat Partner Type** is used for Intrastat reporting only. This way, you can specify different values for the two fields, if you need to.
>
> However, note that if the **Intrastat Partner Type** field is left blank, the value from the **Partner Type** field is used for Intrastat reporting.

Before you can use the Intrastat journal to report Intrastat information, there are several things you must set up:  

* **Intrastat Setup**: Intrastat Setup page is used to enable intrastat reporting and set defaults for it. You can specify whether you need to report Intrastat from shipments (dispatches), receipts (arrivals) or both depending on thresholds set by your local regulations. You can also set default transaction types for regular and return documents, used for nature of transaction reporting.
* **Intrastat journal templates**: You must set up the Intrastat journal templates and batches you will use. Because Intrastat is reported monthly, you must create 12 Intrastat journal batches based on the same template.  
* **Commodity codes**: Customs and tax authorities have established numerical codes that classify items and services. You specify these codes on items.
* **Transaction nature codes**: Countries and regions have different codes for types of Intrastat transactions, such as ordinary purchase and sale, exchange of returned goods, and exchange of non-returned goods. Set up all of the codes that apply to your country/region. You use these codes on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab on sales and purchase documents, and when you process returns.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Starting in January 2022, Intrastat requires different transaction nature code for dispatches to private individuals or non-VAT registered businesses and VAT registered businesses. To comply with this requirement, we recommend that you review and/or add new transaction nature codes in the **Transaction Types** page according to the requirements in your country. You should also review and update the **Intrastat Partner Type** field to *Person* for private individual or non-VAT registered businesses customers in the relevant **Customer** page. If you are unsure about the correct intrastat partner type or transaction type to use, we recommend that you ask an expert in your country or region.

* **Transport methods**: There are seven, one-digit codes for Intrastat transport methods. **1** for sea, **2** for rail, **3** for road, **4** for air, **5** for post, **7** for fixed installations, and **9** for own propulsion (for example, transporting a car by driving it). [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does not require these codes, however, we recommend that the descriptions provide a similar meaning.  
* **Transaction specifications**: Use these to supplement the descriptions from the transaction types.  
* **Country of origin**: Use the two-letter ISO Alpha Codes for the country/region where the good was obtained or produced. If the good was produced in more than one country/region, the country/region of origin is the last country where it was significantly processed.
* **VAT identification number of the partner operator in the Member State of import**: This is the VAT-ID number of the partner operator in the Member State of import. The VAT-ID is also used in the exchange of intra-EU-export data among Member States, and allows Member States to allocate the received data to the importing company in their own country/region. Reporting units must report the VAT-ID of the company that declared the intra-Union acquisition of goods in the Member State of import.

> [!NOTE]
> The business partner VAT-ID to use can differ, depending on the business circumstance. For example, the ID to use differs for scenarios such as chain sales, where a supplier sells a product to another country, and then that company resells the item to another business in the same country, triangular trade, and so on. If you are unsure about the correct VAT-ID to use, we recommend that you ask an expert in your country or region.

Optionally, you can also set up:

* **Areas**: Use these to supplement information about countries and regions.  
* **Entry/exit points**: Use these to specify the locations where you ship or receive items to or from other countries/regions. Heathrow Airport is an example of an entry or exit point. You enter entry or exit points on sales and purchase documents on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab. This information will also be copied from the item entries when you create the Intrastat journal.  

### To set up Intrastat templates and batches

The Intrastat batch jobs include only item entries, and not general ledger entries. If you have general ledger entries that qualify for Intrastat reporting, you must enter them manually. For example, if you purchase a computer from another EU country or region, the computer is not placed in inventory, but is posted to a general ledger account. You must manually enter this type of entry in the Intrastat journal.  

You can export the entries to a file that you can send to your Intrastat authorities. You can also print a report, manually enter the information on the forms from your authorities, and then submit the information.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommended that you set up an Intrastat journal batch for each month.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Create a template for each Intrastat form you use.  
3. To create batches, choose the **Batches** action.  
4. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]. Create a template for each Intrastat form you use.

> [!NOTE]
> In the **Statistics Period** field, enter the statistics period as a four-digit number, where the first two digits represent the year and the next two digits represent the month. For example, enter 1706 for June, 2017.

### To set up transport methods

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transport Methods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### To set up which Intrastat report fields are mandatory

In some countries/regions, such as Spain and UK, the authorities require that Intrastat reports include, for example, the shipment method for purchases or some other values when sales are over a certain threshold. On the **Intrastat Setup** page, you can select to make **Intrastat Checklist Setup** to set mandatory fields on the **Intrastat Journal** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Intrastat Checklist Setup** action.
3. On the **Intrastat Checklist Setup** page, select in the **Field Name** to pick Intrastat report field you want to make mandatory.

### Czechia

Specifically for Czech businesses, you must also set up commodity codes and transaction nature codes.  

#### To set up commodity codes

All items that you buy or sell must have a commodity code.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Commodity Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. To assign a commodity code to an item, go to the **Item Card** page, expand the **Costs & Posting** FastTab, and then enter the code in the **Commodity Code** field.

### Italy

Specifically for Italian businesses, you must also set up commodity codes and transaction nature codes.  

#### To set up transaction nature codes

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transaction Nature Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

> [!TIP]
> If you frequently use a particular transaction nature code, you can make it the default. To do this, go to the **Intrastat Setup** page, and choose the code.

## To report Intrastat

After you fill in the Intrastat journal, you can run the **Checklist report** action to make sure that all information in the journal is correct. Mandatory fields you have set in **Intrastat Checklist Setup** page that are missing values will be shown in Errors and warning fact box on the **Intrastat Journal** page. Afterward, you can print an Intrastat report as a form, or create a file to submit to the tax authority in your country/region.  

### To fill in Intrastat journals

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journal** and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intrastat Journal** page, in the **Batch Name** field, choose the relevant journal batch, and then choose **OK**.  
3. Choose the **Suggest Lines** action. The **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields will already contain the dates specified for the statistics period on the journal batch.  
4. In the **Cost Regulation %** field, you can enter a percentage to cover transport and insurance. If you enter a percentage, the content of the **Statistical Value** field in the journal is proportionally higher.  
5. Choose **OK** to start the batch job.  

The batch job retrieves all the item entries in the statistics period and inserts them as lines in the Intrastat journal. You can edit the lines if needed.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The batch job retrieves only the entries that contain a country/region code for which an Intrastat code has been entered on the **Countries/Regions** page. Therefore, you must enter Intrastat codes for the country/region codes for which you will run the batch job. The batch job sets the **Partner VAT ID** field to *QV999999999999* for private individuals or non-VAT registered businesses (customers with the **Intrastat Partner Type** field set to *Person*), and it uses the value of the **Transaction Type** field on the posted item ledger entry or job ledger entry.

### To modify Intrastat journals lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intrastat Journal** page, in the **Batch Name** field, choose the relevant journal batch, and then choose **OK**.  
3. User filter pane to filter Intrastat Journal lines based on some criteria. For example, filter on **Partner VAT ID** fields with the value *QV999999999999*.
4. Choose **Share** icon ![Share a page in another app.](media/share-icon.png) and select **Edit in Excel**
5. In Excel, modify the Intrastat journal lines that you filtered out. For example, modify **Transaction Type** field values.  
6. Publish the changes that you have made in Excel back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] versions that do not support [**Edit in Excel**](across-work-with-excel.md#edit-in-excel) for journals, you can create configuration packages to export and import Intrastat journal lines to Excel. For more information, see [Migrate On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data) in the administration content.

### Report Intrastat on a form or a file

To get the information that is required on the Intrastat form from the statistical authorities, you must print the **Intrastat – Form** report. Before you can do this, you must prepare the Intrastat journal and fill it in. If you have both sales and purchase transactions, you must complete a separate form for each type, so that you must print the report two times.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intrastat Journal** page, choose the relevant journal batch in the **Batch Name** field.  
3. If you have not already done this, fill in the journal manually or choose **Suggest Lines** action.  
4. Choose the **Prints Intrastat Journal** action.  
5. On the **Intrastat Jnl. Line** FastTab, add a **Type** filter and then specify whether this is a **Receipt** or a **Shipment**.  
6. Choose **Send to** to print the report.  

### Report Intrastat in a file

You can submit the Intrastat report as a file. Before creating the file, you can print a checklist that contains the same information that will be in the file.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intrastat Journal** page, select the relevant journal batch in the **Batch Name** field.  
3. If you have not already done this, fill in the journal manually or by choosing the **Suggest Lines** action.  
4. Choose the **Create File** action.  
5. On the batch job page, choose the **OK** button.  
6. Choose **Save**.  
7. Browse to the location where you want to save the file, enter the file name, and then choose **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> When a line in the Intrastat report has a supplementary unit of measure, the weight of the item will not be shown, since this value is not required.

## Reorganize Intrastat journals

Because you must submit an Intrastat report every month, and you create a new journal batch for each report, you will eventually have many journal batches. The journal lines are not deleted automatically. You may want to reorganize the journal batch names periodically. You do this by deleting the journal batches that you no longer need. The journal lines in these batches are also deleted.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. To view the options, choose the **Batch Name** field.  
3. Choose the journal batches to be deleted, and then choose the **Delete** button.  

## Tariff numbers

In many countries/regions, the customs and tax authorities establish 8-digit item codes for various items. In order for item entries to contain the necessary information when the program imports them to the Intrastat journal line, you must have entered the information about the tariff number in the **Tariff Numbers** page. Find the codes for the items that your company deals with and enter them in the **Tariff Numbers** page.

In the **Tariff Numbers** page, add all the codes that you use. You must enter the codes on the item card before you begin to post. When you have set up the codes, enter them in the **Tariff No.** field on the item card. You must also fill in the **Net Weight** field on the item card.

# Map e-documents to purchase order lines with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

As procurement processes become more digital, the e-documents feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] plays a key role in automating how companies receive and process vendor invoices. Copilot can help by improving the mapping and matching of lines on vendor invoices to purchase orders. Copilot can reduce the time you spend on tasks that would normally require extensive search, lookup, and data entry. Another benefit is when vendor invoices don't relate exactly with purchase orders. Copilot can identify the corresponding purchase orders. Enhanced matching capabilities particularly benefit small and mid-sized organizations that need efficient document tracking for purchase order lines.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

The **E-Document** app supports scenarios for e-documents throughout the sales process. Copilot can also refine how you manage e-documents in the purchase process, particularly with respect to purchase orders. The app lets you specify the type of purchase document to create for each vendor when you receive e-invoices from them.

You can update existing purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the information from you received in the e-invoice.

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Prerequisites

- Your admin must activate the **E-Document Matching Assistance** capability. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).  

## Identify purchase orders

First, you can identify the purchase orders that you can automatically match. If your **Vendor** configured the **Receive E-Document To** field to work with **Purchase Orders**, when the electronic document is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (manually or from an external endpoint), [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does the following:

1. If the purchase order for this vendor exists and there's a purchase order number in the received e-document file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically links the e-document with the purchase order. The **Document Status** of this **E-Document** is **In Progress**, and the **E-Document Status** in the **Service Status** subpage is **Order linked**.  
The link shows in the **Document** field on the e-document. If you need to change the purchase order, you can use the **Update Purchase Order Link** action and then manually choose another purchase order for this vendor. You can only do so before you match the lines on the e-document and purchase order.  
2. If the purchase order for this vendor exists but there isn't a purchase order number in the received e-document file, if you manually upload the document you can choose an existing purchase order by opening the **Purchase Orders** list from the orders that you got from vendors that contain only e-document. If you don't select the correct purchase order, or if you received the e-document automatically from an external endpoint using the **Job Queue**, the new e-document isn't linked with a purchase document and the **Document Status** field shows **Error** and the **E-Document Status** in the **Service Status** subpage is **Imported document processing error**. To finish linking the purchase order, choose the **Update Purchase Order Link** action, and then choose a purchase order for the vendor.  

## Map lines

Copilot helps you automatically match e-invoice lines with purchase order lines, and offers extra matching intelligence to improve the matches.

After they're matched and mapped, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the matched purchase order with the relevant receipt information to ensure the correct quantities are received on the order lines.

You can match your received electronic documents with purchase order lines from two different places, from the **E-Documents** page or from the **Purchase Order** page. The easiest way to find purchase orders that are already linked is to use the **Linked Purchase Orders** tile on your Role Center. To find documents that aren't linked, use the **Waiting Purchase E-Invoices** tile to open a list of e-documents that are waiting for review.  

> [!NOTE]
> The **E-Document Activities** group with these two tiles is available in the following Role Centers:
>
> - Business Manager Evaluation
> - Business Manager
> - Accountant
> - Inventory Manager
> - Shipping and Receiving

When you want to run matching from a purchase order, select the **Map E-Document Lines with Copilot** action. The action is available on the **Purchase Orders** list page and the **Purchase Order** page. If you want to run matching from the **E-Documents** page, select the **Match Purchase Order with Copilot** action. To process with matching, follow these steps:

1. Select the **Map E-Document Lines with Copilot** or **Match Purchase Order with Copilot** action for documents that are already linked.  
1. The **E-Document Match Order Lines with Copilot** prompt displays and the **Purchase Order Matching** page in the background. Copilot is automatically creating the mapping for you.
1. After a few seconds, the **E-Document Match Order Lines with Copilot** page suggests lines for matching with a few details:

    1. The prompt header has the following information:

    |Field name |Description |
    |--------|-----------------|
    |Auto-matched | Specifies the number of matches proposed automatically. This number is based on a string comparison. If 80% or more of the descriptions overlap, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches them automatically without using Copilot capabilities. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also shows lines as auto-matched as item references exist with appropriate conditions. |
    |Copilot matched | Specifies the number of matches proposed by Copilot using both string and semantic comparison. |
    |E-Document No. | Specifies the linked e-document number. |
    |Invoice Total Amount Excl. VAT | Specifies the total invoice amount excluding VAT. |
    |Matched Total Amount Incl. VAT | Specifies the matched amount excluding VAT. |

    1. If all lines match, the following text displays in green font in the upper-right corner, **All lines (100%) are matched. Review match proposals**.  
    1. The **Matched proposal** lines contain the following information:  

       |Field name |Description |
       |--------|-----------------|
       |E-Document Line No. | Specifies the e-document line number from the original e-document file. |
       |E-Document Line Description | Specifies the e-document line description from the original e-document file. |
       |Matched Quantity | Specifies the quantity that is applied to the purchase order line. |
       |Proposal | Specifies the action that Copilot proposed for matching the purchase order lines. |
       |Learn Matching Rule | Specifies whether to create a matching rule for this proposal. If you select this checkbox, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates item references for items and text to account mappings for G/L accounts. |

    1. All fully suggested and matched lines are marked with green color. If there's an issue, for example, a different price but within the allowed price range, this line is marked with a yellow color. If there's any similarity between the description fields but the price difference is larger than allowed, this line is marked with a red color.
    1. If you aren't satisfied with some suggestions, you can delete them using the **Delete Line** action.  
    1. If you want to see proposal matchings, you can select the link in the **Proposal** column to open the **E-Document Match Details** page.
    1. On the **E-Document Match Details** page you can compare details from the **E-Documents** and **Purchase Order**, to be sure about the suggested matching before confirming it.
    1. After reviewing, close the page.

1. If you aren't satisfied with most of the suggestions, or if you don't want to use the **E-Document Match Order Lines with Copilot** feature, select **Discard it**. You can create the matches manually. To learn more, go to[manual matching](finance-how-use-edocuments-purchase.md).

# The Image Analyzer Extension

The Image Analyzer extension uses powerful image analytics provided by the Computer Vision API for Azure Cognitive Services to detect attributes in the images that you import for items and contact persons, so you can easily review and assign them. For items, attributes could be whether the item is a table or a car, and whether it is red or blue. For contact persons, attributes can be gender or age.

Image Analyzer suggests attributes based on tags that the Computer Vision API finds, and a confidence level. By default, it suggests attributes only if it is at least 80% sure that the attribute is correct. You can set another confidence level, if needed. To learn more about how the tags and confidence level are determined, see [Computer Vision API](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=851476).  

Image Analyzer is free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], but there is a limit to the number of items that you can analyze during a certain period of time. By default, you can analyze 100 images per month.

After you enable the extension, Image Analyzer runs each time you import an image to an item or contact person. You will see the attributes, confidence level, and details right away, and can decide what to do with each attribute. If you imported images before you enabled the Image Analyzer extension, you must go to the item or contact cards and choose the **Analyze Picture** action.  

## Privacy notice

This extension uses the Computer Vision API from Azure Cognitive Services, which may have varying levels of compliance commitments than [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you enable the Image Analyzer extension, Customer Data such as a contact image or an item image will be sent to the Computer Vision API. By installing this extension, you agree for this limited set of data to be sent to the Computer Vision API. Note that you may disable, and uninstall, the Image Analyzer extension at any time to discontinue use of this functionality. For more information, see [Microsoft Trust Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=851463).

## Requirements

There are a few requirements for the images:

* Image formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP  
* Maximum file size: Less than 4 MB  
* Image dimensions: Greater than 50 x 50 pixels  

## Switch on the Image Analyzer extension

The Image Analyzer extension is built in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You just need to switch it on.

> [!NOTE]  
> To enable the Image Analyzer extension, you must be an administrator. Make sure that you are assigned the **SUPER** user permission set. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

To enable the Image Analyzer extension, take one of the following actions:

* Open an item or contact card. In the notification bar, choose **Analyze Picture**, then follow the steps in the assisted setup guide.  
* Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Connections**, and then choose **Image Analysis Setup**. Choose the **Enable Image Analyzer** check box, and then complete the steps in the assisted setup guide.  

    > [!TIP]  
    > The **Image Analysis Setup** page is also where you can change the degree of confidence for attribute suggestions. For example, if you want to require a greater degree of confidence, you can enter a higher percentage.

## Analyze an item image

The following steps describe how to analyze an image that was imported before you enabled the Image Analyzer extension.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the item, and then choose the **Analyze Picture** action.  
3. The **Image Analyzer Attributes** page displays the detected attributes, the confidence level, and other details about the attribute. Use the **Action to perform** options to specify what to do with the attribute or choose **Add to item description** to add the name of the attribute to the item description. For example, this action can be useful for quickly adding detail.

The **Action to perform** field has following options:

| Action | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| *Ignore* | No actions will be performed. |
| *Use as attribute* | The value is added to the item attributes. Learn more at [Work with Item Attributes](inventory-how-work-item-attributes.md). |
| *Use as a category* | The selected value is added as a category. Learn more at [Categorize Items](inventory-how-categorize-items.md). |
| *Add to blocklist* | If the analysis suggests an attribute that you do not want to see, you can block the attribute. Use caution, however. Blocked attributes are not suggested for other items either. If you regret blocking an attribute, choose **View Blocked Attributes**, and then delete the attribute from the list. |

> [!NOTE]  
> By default **Item Attributes** displays attributes where **Confidence Score** is above **Confidence Score Threshold %** defined in the **Image Analysis Setup**. To see all detected attributes, choose the **View All Attributes** action.

## Analyze a contact person picture

The following steps describe how to analyze an image that was imported before you enabled the Image Analyzer extension.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the contact person, and then choose the **Analyze Picture** action.  
3. On the **Profile Questionnaire** FastTab, review the suggestions, and make corrections if needed. Learn more at [Use Profile Questionnaires to Classify Business Contacts](marketing-create-contact-profile-questionnaire.md).  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >
    > The Computer Vision API returns following attributes:
    >
    > * *age*
    >
    >     An estimated "visual age" in years. It is how old a person looks as opposed to the actual biological age.
    > * *gender*
    >
    >    Male or female.
    >
    > The Computer Vision API doesn't return a confidence level for age and gender attributes.
  
## Use your own Computer Vision API account

You can also use your own account for the Computer Vision API, for example, if you want to analyze more images than the default integration offers.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Image Analysis Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter the **API URI** and **API Key** that you received for Computer Vision API.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You must add **/analyze** at the end of the API URI, if it isn't already there. For example: ```https://cronus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/analyze```.

## See how many analyses you have left in the current period

You can view the number of analyses you've done, and how many you can still do, in the current period.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Image Analysis Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. The **Limit Type**, **Limit Value**, and **Analyses Performed** fields provide the usage information.

title: Transferring and posting cost entries
description: Before you define cost allocations, you must understand the various sources that cost entries come from.

# Transferring and posting cost entries

Before you define cost allocations, you must understand how cost entries come from the following sources:  

- Automatic transfer of general ledger entries.  
- Manual cost posting for pure cost entries, internal charges, and manual allocations.  
- Automatic allocation postings for actual costs.  
- Transfer of budget entries to actual.

## Criteria for transferring general ledger entries to cost entries

It's important to understand the criteria for transferring general ledger entries to cost entries. During the transfer, the **Transfer GL Entries to CA** batch job uses the following criteria to determine if and how the general ledger entries are transferred.  

General ledger entries are transferred if:  

- The entries have dimension values corresponding to either a cost center or a cost object.  
- The entries have dimension values that correspond to a cost center and a cost object. For these entries, the cost center takes precedence. This helps avoid a situation where a cost type appears in both a cost object and a cost center and is therefore counted twice in the statistics.  
- The document number in the entries is empty, so it will appear with a document number of 0000 in the cost entries.  
- The entries are transferred to a cost type that allows for combined entries and these entries are transferred as a combined entry either monthly or daily.  

General ledger entries aren't transferred if:  

- The entries have dimension values that don't correspond to a cost center or a cost object.  
- The entries have an amount of zero.  
- The entries have a general ledger account that has been deleted.  
- The entries have a general ledger account that isn't of the type **Income Statement**.  
- The entries have a general ledger account that isn't assigned a cost type.  
- The entries have a posting date before the **Starting Date for G/L Transfer**.  
- The entries have been posted with a closing date. These are typically entries that set back the balance of the income statement at the end of the year.

## Transferring general ledger entries to cost entries

You can transfer general ledger entries to cost entries.  

Before you run the process for transferring general ledger entries to cost entries, you must prepare the transfer to avoid manual correction posting.  

### To prepare the transfer  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cost Accounting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Cost Accounting Setup** page, verify that the **Starting Date for G/L Transfer** field is set to the correct value.  
3.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Cost Types**, and then choose the related link.  
4.  On the **Cost Type Card** page, verify that the **G/L Account Range** field is linked correctly for each cost type to take entries from the general ledger.  
5.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
6.  For each relevant general ledger account, on the **G/L Account Card** page, verify that the **Cost Type No.** field is linked correctly to a cost type. For more information, see [Setting Up Cost Accounting](finance-set-up-cost-accounting.md).  
7.  Verify that all relevant general ledger entries have dimension values that correspond to a cost center and a cost object.  

### To transfer general ledger entries to cost entries

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer GL Entries to CA**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Yes** button to start the transfer. The process transfers all general ledger entries that haven't already been transferred.  

During the transfer, the process creates connections in the entries in the **Cost Entry** table and the **Cost Register** table. This makes it possible to trace the source of cost entries.

## Automatic transfer and combined entries

In cost accounting, you can transfer general ledger entries to a cost type by using a combined posting. You can specify if a cost type receives combined entries in the **Combine Entries** field in the cost type definition. The following table describes the different options.  

|Combine Entries|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|None|Each general ledger entry is transferred individually to the corresponding cost type.|  
|Day|General ledger entries with the same posting date are transferred as one entry to the corresponding cost type.|  
|Month|All general ledger entries in the same calendar month are transferred as one entry to the corresponding cost type.|  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you have selected the **Auto Transfer from G/L** check box on the **Cost Accounting Setup** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the cost accounting after every posting in the general ledger. Combined entries are not possible.

## Results of transferring general ledger entries to cost entries

During the transfer of general ledger entries to cost entries, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates connections in the entries in the **G/L Entry** table, the **Cost Entry** table, and the **Cost Register** table to make it possible to trace the connections between cost entries and general ledger entries.  

### General ledger entries

For each general ledger entry that is transferred to cost accounting, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fills the cost **Entry No.** field.  

### Cost entries

For each cost entry, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] saves the entry number of the corresponding general ledger entry in the **G/L Entry No.** field in the **Cost Entry** table.  

For combined cost entries, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] saves the entry number of the last general ledger entry, which is the entry with the highest entry number.  

The **G/L Account** field in the **Cost Entry** table contains the number of the general ledger account that the cost entry came from.  

For single cost entries, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] transfers the posting text from the general ledger entry to the **Description** text field. For combined entries, the text field shows these entries are transferred as combined entries. For example, for a combined entry for the month of October in 2013, the text can be **Combined Entries, October 2013**.  

### Cost register

In the **Cost Register** table, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an entry with the source transfer from general ledger. The entry records the first and last entry numbers of the general ledger entries that are transferred, in addition to the first, and last entry numbers of the cost entries that are created.

# Enable picking items by FEFO

First-Expired-First-Out (FEFO) is a sorting method that ensures that items with the earliest expiration dates are picked first.  

 This functionality only works when the following criteria are met:

- The item must be assigned an item tracking code where the **SN Warehouse Tracking**, **Lot Warehouse Tracking**, or **Package Warehouse Tracking** fields are selected. The item must be posted to inventory with an expiration date.
- On the location, the **Pick According to FEFO** toggle must be turned on.

Depending on which document you plan to use, make some more settings:

- **Inventory Pick**. You can use picking by FEFO for locations with and without bins.
- **Warehouse Pick**. On the location, the **Bin Mandatory** toggles must be turned on.

When all the criteria are met, the serial/lot-numbered items to pick are sorted with the oldest first in all picks and movements.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If some serial or lot-numbered items have specific tracking defined in the source document, such as sales order, then those are respected first and under them, the remaining, non-specific, serial/lot numbers are listed according to FEFO.
<br /><br />
If two serial or lot-numbered items have the same expiration date, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] selects the item with the lowest serial or lot number.
<br /><br />
When picking serial or lot-numbered items in locations set up for directed put-away and pick, only quantities in bins of the type *Pick* are picked according to FEFO.  
<br /><br />
To enable movements according to FEFO, leave the **From Bin** field empty on the **Inventory Movement** or **Movement Worksheet** pages.  
<br /><br />
If the **Strict Expiration Posting** field is selected on the **Item Tracking Code Card**, only items that aren't expired are included in the pick, and the lines are sorted according to the FEFO principle.
<br /><br />
> If you posted the item to inventory without an expiration date, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] populates the serial or lot number as a warehouse pick, but not an inventory pick.

# Set up nondeductible VAT

Nondeductible value-added tax (VAT) is the VAT that's payable by a purchaser but that isn't deductible from the purchaser's own VAT liability. Companies can usually recover VAT on the purchase of goods and services that are related to their business activities. However, in some situations, a business incurs VAT that isn't deductible. These situations are typically related to the local regulations and can differ among countries/regions. However, the model of using nondeductible or partially deductible VAT is similar. You can use proportional VAT to calculate VAT when there's deductible and nondeductible VAT.

In general, VAT can't be deducted for some purchases because of the following factors:

- **The type of goods or services that are purchased** – VAT is fully or partially nondeductible according to the law about goods such as cars, mobile phones, and food purchased at restaurants.
- **Partially deductible pro-rated VAT** – VAT is pro-rated according to the ratio between the sales operations that VAT is owed for and all performed operations. VAT that exceeds this ratio can't be deducted.

Because it can be difficult to know where and how an item is used, contact the local tax authorities in your country/region. They can help determine whether you can deduct a specified percentage of the VAT, based on historical data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This global feature is available in all countries with enabled VAT **except for Belgium, Italy, and Norway**. These localizations already have existing local feature and will be upgraded in the future. Don't run this feature in these countries because the upgrade procedure doesn't exist.

## Use nondeductible VAT

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the **Enable Non-Deductible VAT** checkbox.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > After you enable non-deductible VAT, you can't turn it off, because the feature might include changes to data and might initiate an upgrade of some database tables. Microsoft strongly recommends that you first enable and test this feature in the sandbox environment before you enable it in the production environment.

3. Configure how the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] treats nondeductible VAT values.

    1. In the **Use For Item Cost** field, specify whether the nondeductible VAT must be added to the item cost when you purchase items. Otherwise, the nondeductible VAT won't influence the item cost and the full amount is recorded only at the general ledger level.
    2. Select the **Use For Fixed Asset Cost** checkbox to add the nondeductible VAT to the fixed asset cost when you purchase new fixed assets. Otherwise, the nondeductible VAT won't influence the fixed asset cost and the full amount is recorded only at the general ledger level.
    3. Select the **Use For Job Cost** checkbox to specify that the nondeductible VAT must be added to the project cost when you purchase items for the project. Otherwise, the nondeductible VAT  won't influence the project cost and the full amount is recorded only at the general ledger level.
    4. Select the **Show Non-Ded. VAT In Lines** checkbox to specify that the nondeductible VAT must be shown on document line pages for easier manipulation of VAT amounts.

## Use the nondeductible VAT percentage

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **VAT Posting Setup** page, set the fields as described in the following table.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Allow Non-Deductible VAT** | Specify whether the nondeductible VAT is considered for the current combination of a VAT business posting group and a VAT product posting group. |
    | **Non-Deductible VAT %** | Specify the percentage of the transaction amount that VAT isn't applied to. |
    | **Non- Deductible Purchase VAT Account** | Specify the account associated with the VAT amount that isn't deducted because of the type of goods or services that are purchased. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > To have general ledger (G/L) entries that use the dedicated account instead of the sales/purchase account, you can either leave the **Non-Deductible Purchase VAT Account** field blank or set the **G/L Account** field.

3. Select **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use unrealized VAT together with non-deductible VAT.
>
> Don't use the same **VAT identifier** value for both normal VAT where the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field is set to **0** (zero) and normal VAT where the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field is set to a non-zero value. Otherwise, the total non-deductible VAT amount will be incorrectly calculated.

# Manage Many Incoming Document Records

As you create or process incoming document records, the number of lines on the **Incoming Documents** page may grow to an extent where you lose overview. Therefore, you can set incoming document records to *Processed* to remove them from the default view. When you choose the **Show All** action, you can view both processed and unprocessed records.

> [!NOTE]  
> You cannot edit information, attach files, or perform other processes on incoming document records that are set to *Processed*. You must first set it to *Unprocessed*.

The **Processed** check box is automatically selected on incoming document records that have been processed, but you can also select or deselect the check box manually. Depending on your business process, an incoming document record may be processed when a related document has been created for it or a file has been attached.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you open the **Incoming Documents** page with the **My Incoming Documents** action on the Role Center, only unprocessed incoming document records are shown by default. This is referred to in this topic as "the default view".

## To remove incoming document records from the default view

1. On the **Incoming Documents** page, select one or more lines for incoming document records that you want to remove from the default view.
2. Choose the **Set to Processed** action.

    The incoming document records are removed from the default view, and the **Processed** check box is selected on the lines.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also perform this action for the individual record on the **Incoming Document Card** page.

## To view all incoming document records

1. On the **Incoming Documents** page, choose the **Show All** action.

All incoming document records are displayed, including records where the **Processed** check box isn't selected.

## To add incoming document records to the default view

1. On the **Incoming Documents** page, choose the **Show All** action.
2. Select one or more lines for incoming document records that you want to appear in the default view.
3. Choose the **Set to Unprocessed** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also perform this action for the individual record on the **Incoming Document Card** page.

# Restrict and allow usage of a record

If you want to restrict a record from being used in certain activities, for example, until the record has been approved, you can add two workflow responses in the workflow that controls the use of the record. One workflow response restricts usage of the record as defined by the workflow event and conditions. The other workflow response allows the use of the record as defined by the workflow event and conditions. Two responses exist in the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for this purpose: **Add record restriction** and **Remove record restriction**.

> [!NOTE]  
> The default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers support for restricting a record from being posted, from being exported as a payment, and from being printed as a check. To support other restrictions, a Microsoft partner must customize the application code.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The workflow functionality to restrict and allow records from being used is not related to the functionality to block item, customer, and vendor records from being posted.

The following procedure describes how to restrict purchase orders from being posted until they've been approved. The new workflow is based on the *Purchase Invoice Approval Workflow* template.  

## Create a workflow step that restricts posting of unapproved purchase orders

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Workflows** page, choose the **New Workflow from Template** action. Learn more at [Create Workflows from Workflow Templates](across-how-to-create-workflows-from-workflow-templates.md).
3. On the **Workflow Templates** page, choose the *Purchase Invoice Approval Workflow* template.  

   Note that the first two workflow steps are about restricting and then allowing usage of purchase invoices. Change the event condition on the first step of the new workflow to specify that it applies to purchase orders.  
4. On the **Workflow Steps** FastTab, choose the **On Condition** field for the first step, then, for the **Document Type** filter, select **Order**.  
5. Proceed to edit, delete, or add other workflow steps to reflect a business process that begins by restricting unapproved purchase orders from being posted.

# The WorldPay Payments Standard extension

> [!CAUTION]
> The WorldPay Payments Standard extension will be deprecated. The code is marked as obsolete starting in 2023 release wave 2. The app will be active for the next three major releases and then it will be removed.

The WorldPay Payments Standard extension lets you offer customers a convenient alternative to making payments through bank transfers or credit cards. Not only that, payments made through payment services will typically land in your bank account more quickly.

If you enable the extension, when you send a sales invoice by email the document includes a link to the payment service in the email body and in the attached PDF document. A customer can choose the link, and then use the payment service to make the payment.

Enabling payment service extensions is free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], however, you'll need to contact the payment service to get an account. For more information, see [Enable Customer Payment Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

# Business Central for Multi-Site and International Organizations
Organizations that have multiple sites often use a hub-and-spoke business model where a parent company, or headquarters, manages the overall operations of the business while each site functions as a single, standalone entity. Sites are often geographically distributed and have different needs for sharing information with the headquarter company. Additionally, sites typically don't need the same level of complexity, and often lack the resources to maintain a large system.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives small and mid-sized businesses a business management solution that's easy-to-use and maintain at a low cost of ownership.

This article introduces some of the ways in which [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports a hub-and-spoke business model.

## Integrating the Headquarter Company and the Sites

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can integrate with the headquarter company's accounting system while meeting the varying needs of different sites, regardless of size, location, or type of business.

The following diagram is an example of different sites integrated with a headquarter company.

![Diagram Description automatically generated.](media/multisite-headquarter-sites.png)

## Meet the Needs of Domestic and International Sites

Business needs at sites often differ based on industry, business methods, or their relationship to the headquarter company. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can be easily adapted and extended for various types of businesses and locales. Microsoft AppSource offers a wealth of apps from Microsoft and our partners, and partners can quickly deploy [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with minimal disruption to daily operations.

For multi-national organizations, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports local legal requirements and business practices.

* For online versions, there are more than [40 localized country/region versions](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json) that you can install as extensions from Microsoft AppSource.  
* For on-premises versions, [country/region versions](/azure/architecture/solution-ideas/articles/business-central) are available either as Microsoft-localized versions or partner-led add-on localizations.

A network of more than 4,000 Microsoft partners world-wide provides local expertise.

## Respond Quickly to New Business Conditions

The headquarter company must be able to react quickly to business changes at each site. Combined with Power Automate, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can serve as an early warning mechanism.

# Process sales returns or cancellations

If a customer wants to return items or be reimbursed for items or services that you have sold and received payment for, you must create and post a sales credit memo that specifies the requested change. To include the correct sales invoice information, you can do the following tasks:  

- Create the sales credit memo directly from the posted sales invoice.
- Create a new sales credit memo with copied invoice information.

If you need more control of the sales return process, such as warehouse documents for the item handling, or a better overview when receiving items from multiple sales documents with one sales return, then you can create sales return orders. A sales return order automatically issues the related sales credit memo and other return-related documents, such as a replacement sales order, if needed. For more information, see [Process sales return orders](sales-how-process-sales-returns-orders.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If a posted sales invoice has not yet been paid, then you can use the **Correct** or **Cancel** functions on the posted sales invoice to reverse transactions. These functions only work for unpaid invoices, and they do not support partial returns or cancellations. For more information, see [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Sales Invoices](sales-how-correct-cancel-sales-invoice.md).

A return or reimbursement might relate to only some of the items or services on the original sales invoice. In that case, you must edit information on the lines on the sales credit memo or sales return order. When you post the sales credit memo or sales return order, the sales documents that are affected by the change are reversed and a refund payment can be created for the customer. For more information, see [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).  

The credit memo posting will also revert any item charges that were assigned to the posted document, so that the item's value entries are the same as before the item charge was assigned.

> [!NOTE]
> The bookkeeping aspects of sales returns, such as the payments to customers as reimbursement, is considered bookkeeping work and not described here. For more information, see [Managing Payables](payables-manage-payables.md).

## To create a sales credit memo from a posted sales invoice  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Posted Sales Invoices** page, select the posted sales invoice that you want to reverse, choose the **Cancel** action, and then choose the **Create Corrective Credit Memo** action.

    The sales credit memo header contains some information from the posted sales invoice. You can edit this, for example, with new information that reflects the return agreement.  
3. Edit information on the lines according to the agreement, such as the number of returned items or the amount to reimburse.
4. Choose the **Prepare** action, and then choose the **Apply Entries** action.
5. On the **Apply Customer Entries** page, select the line with the posted sales document that you want to apply the sales credit memo to, and then choose the **Applies-to ID** action.

    The identifier of the sales credit memo displays in the **Applies-to ID** field.
6. In the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount that you want to apply if it's smaller than the original amount.  

    At the bottom of the **Apply Customer Entries** page, you can see the total amount to apply to reverse all involved entries, namely when the value in the **Balance** field is zero.
7. Choose the **OK** button. When you post the sales credit memo, it is applied to the posted sales documents.

    After you create or edit sales credit memo lines, and the single or multiple applications are specified, you can post the sales credit memo.  
8. Choose the **Posting** action, then choose the **Post and Send** action.  

The **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box opens showing the preferred sending method for the customer. You can change the sending method by choosing the lookup button for the **Send Document** to field. For more information, see [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).  

The posted sales documents that you applied the credit memo to are now reversed, and a refund payment can be created for the customer. The sales credit memo is removed and replaced with a new document in the list of posted sales credit memos.

## To create a sales credit memo by copying a posted sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty sales credit memo.
3. In the **Customer Name** field, enter the name of an existing customer.
4. Choose the **Prepare** action, then choose the **Copy Document** action.
5. On the **Copy Sales Document** page, in the **Document Type** field, select **Posted Invoice**.
6. Choose the **Document No.** field to open the **Posted Sales Invoices** page, and then select the posted sales invoice record that contains lines that you want to reverse.
7. Select the **Recalculate Lines** check box if you want the copied posted sales invoice lines to be updated with any changes in item price and unit cost since the invoice was posted.
8. Choose the **OK** button. The copied invoice lines are inserted in the sales credit memo.
9. Complete the sales credit memo as explained in [To create a sales credit memo from a posted sales invoice](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-sales-credit-memo-from-a-posted-sales-invoice).

## To create a sales allowance
You can send a customer a credit memo with a price reduction if the customer has received slightly damaged items or received the items late.  
You can post this reduced price as an item charge in a credit memo or a return order and assign it to the posted shipment. The following describes it for a sales credit memo, but the same steps apply to a sales return order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty sales credit memo.
3. Fill in the credit memo header with relevant information about the customer that you want to give the sales allowance to.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select **Charge (Item)**.  
5. In the **No.** field, select the appropriate item charge value.  
     You might want to create a special item charge number to cover sales allowances.  
6. In the **Quantity** field, enter **1**.  
7. In the **Unit Price Excl. Tax** field, enter the amount of the sales allowance.  
8. Assign the sales allowance as an item charge to the items in the posted shipment. For more information, see [Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md). When you have assigned the allowance, return to the **Sales Credit Memo** page.  

When you post the sales return order, the sales allowance is added to the relevant sales entry amount. In this way, you can maintain accurate inventory valuation.

## To combine return receipts
You can combine return receipts if your customer returns several items that are covered by different sales return orders.  

When you receive the items into your warehouse, post the relevant sales return orders as received. This creates posted return receipts.  

When you're ready to invoice this customer, instead of invoicing each sales return order separately, you can create a sales credit memo and automatically copy the posted return receipt lines to this document. Then you can post the sales credit memo and conveniently invoice all the open sales return orders at once.  

To combine return receipts, the **Combine Shipments** check box must be selected on the **Customer Card** page.  

### To manually combine return receipts  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **Get Return Receipt Lines** action.  
5. Select the return receipt lines that you want to include in the credit memo:  

    - To insert all lines, select all lines, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    - To insert specific lines, select the lines, and then choose the **OK** button.  
6.  If an incorrect shipment line was selected or you want to start over, you can simply delete the lines on the credit memo and rerun the **Get Return Receipt Lines** function.  
7.  Post the invoice.  

### To automatically combine return receipts

You can automatically combine return receipts and have the option of automatically posting the credit memos using the  **Combine Return Receipts** function.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Combine Return Receipts**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Combine Return Receipts** page, fill in the fields to select the relevant return receipts.
3. Select the **Post Credit Memos** check box. If not, you must manually post the resulting purchase credit memos.
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

### To remove a received and invoiced return order

When you invoice return receipts in this way, the return orders from which the return receipts were posted still exist, even if they have been fully received and invoiced.  

When return receipts are combined on a credit memo and posted, a posted sales credit memo is created for the credited lines. The **Quantity Invoiced** field on the originating sales return order is updated based on the invoiced quantity.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Sales Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Specify in the **No.** filter field which return orders to delete.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

Alternatively, delete individual sales return orders manually.  

## Inventory costing

To preserve correct inventory valuation, you typically want to put returned items back in inventory at the unit cost that they were sold at, not at their current unit cost. This is referred to as exact cost reversing.

Two functions exist to assign exact cost reversing automatically:  

|Function|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function on the **Sales Return Order** page|Copies lines of one or more posted documents to be reversed into the sales return order. For more information, see [Create a sales return order based on one or more posted sales documents](sales-how-process-sales-returns-orders.md#create-a-sales-return-order-based-on-one-or-more-posted-sales-documents).|  
|**Copy Document** function in the **Sales Credit Memo** and **Sales Return Order** pages|Copies both the header and lines of one posted document to be reversed.<br /><br /> Requires that the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** check box is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.|

To assign exact cost reversing manually, you must choose the **Appl.-from Item Entry** field on any type of return document line, and then select the number of the original sales entry. This links the sales credit memo or sales return order to the original sales entry and ensures that the item is valued at the original unit cost.

For more information, see [Design Details: Inventory Costing](design-details-inventory-costing.md).

# Work with general journals

Most financial transactions are posted to the general ledger through documents such as purchase invoices and sales orders. However by posting journal lines, you can also process business activities such as:

* Purchasing
* Payments
* Using recurring journals to post accruals
* Refunding employee expenses

Most journals are based on the general journal, and you can process all transactions on the **General Journals** page. Learn more at [Post Transactions Directly to the General Ledger](finance-how-post-transactions-directly.md).  

For example, you can use post employee expenses for reimbursement. Learn more at [Record and Reimburse Employees' Expenses](finance-how-record-reimburse-employee-expenses.md).

However, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also offers journals that are optimized for specific types of transactions, such as the *Payment Journal* for registering payments. Learn more at [Record Payments and Refunds in the Payment Journal](payables-how-post-payments-refunds.md).  

You use general journals to post financial transactions to general ledger accounts and various other accounts. The other accounts include bank, customer, vendor, and employee accounts. Posting with a general journal creates entries on general ledger accounts even when, for example, you post a journal line to a customer account. The entry is posted to a general ledger receivables account through a posting group.

The information that you enter in a journal is temporary and can be changed while it's in the journal. When you post the journal, the information is transferred to entries on individual accounts, where it can't be changed. You can, however, unapply posted entries, and you can post reversing or correcting entries. Learn more at [Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments](finance-how-reverse-journal-posting.md).

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip](includes/journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip.md)]  

## Add context to general journal transactions

When you create a journal, you can add links that give context to its transactions. When you post the journal, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] copies the links to the posted journal and ledger entries the journal creates. For example, providing links can make life easier for your auditor. If you keep images of your expense receipts on your company's Sharepoint site, you can add links to the files. When you post the journal to submit your expenses, your auditor can quickly get to the receipt files.

## Use journal templates and batches

There are several general journal templates. Each journal template is represented by a dedicated page with particular functions and the fields that are required to support those functions, such as the **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page to process bank payments and the **Payment Journals** page to pay your vendors or reimburse your employees. Learn more at [Make Payments](payables-make-payments.md) and [Reconcile Customer Payments with the Cash Receipt Journal or from Customer Ledger Entries](receivables-how-apply-sales-transactions-manually.md).

For each journal template, you can set up your own personal journal as a journal batch. For example, you can define your own journal batch for the payment journal that has your personal layout and settings. The following tip is an example of how to personalize a journal.

> [!TIP]  
> If you select the **Suggest Balancing Amount** checkbox on the line for your batch on the **General Journal Batches** page, then the **Amount** field on, for example, general journal lines for the same document number is automatically prefilled with the value that is required to balance the document. Learn more at [Letting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Suggest Values](ui-let-system-suggest-values.md).

> [!TIP]
> You can add or remove fields in journals by personalizing them. Learn more at [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

### Validating general journal batches

You can turn on a background check that helps prevent delays when posting. The check notifies you when a mistake in the financial journal you're working on will prevent you from posting the journal. On the **General Journal Batches** page, you can choose **Background Error Check** to have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] validate finance journals, such as general or payment journals, while you're working on them.

When you enable the validation, the **Check Document** or **Journal Check** FactBoxes show issues in the current line and the whole batch. Validation happens when you load a finance journal batch, and when you choose another journal line. The **Issues total** tile in the FactBox shows the total number of issues that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] found, and you can choose it to open an overview of the issues.

You can use the **Show Lines with Issues** and **Show All Lines** actions to toggle between journal lines that do or don't have issues. The **Journal Line Details** FactBox provides quick overview and access to data from journal lines, such as the G/L account, customer, or vendor, and the posting setup for specific accounts.

[!INCLUDE [background_doc_journal_check](includes/background_doc_journal_check.md)]  

## Understanding main accounts and balancing accounts

If you set up default balancing accounts for the journal batches on the **General Journals** page, the balancing account is filled in automatically when you fill in the **Account No.** field. Otherwise, fill in both the **Account No.** and **Bal. Account No.** fields manually. A positive amount in the **Amount** field is debited to the main account and credited to the balancing account. A negative amount is credited to the main account and debited to the balancing account.

> [!NOTE]  
> VAT is calculated separately for the main account and the balancing account, so they can use different VAT percentage rates.

## Work with recurring journals

A recurring journal is a general journal with specific fields for managing transactions that you often post with few, if any, changes. For example, transactions for expenses such as rent, subscriptions, electricity, and heat. Using recurring journals lets you post fixed and variable amounts, and specify automatic reversal entries for the day after the posting date. Allocation keys let you divide the recurring entries among various accounts. Learn more at [Allocating Recurring Journal Amounts to Several Accounts](#allocating-recurring-journal-amounts-to-several-accounts).

With a recurring journal, you create the entries that you post regularly only one time. For example, the accounts, dimensions, dimension values, and so on, stay in the journal after posting. If changes are needed, you can make them each time you post.

### Recurring Method field

The **Recurring Method** field is important. It determines how to treat the amount on the journal line after posting. For example, if you use the same amount every time you post the line, you can let the amount remain. If you'll use the same accounts and text on the line, but the amount varies every time you post, you can delete the amount after posting.

| To | See |
| --- | --- |
|F Fixed|The amount on the journal line remains after posting. Lines with amounts of zero remain in the journal, but aren't posted. You can update the amount in a later run.  |
|V Variable|The amount on the journal line is deleted after posting.|
|B Balance|The posted amount on the account on the line is allocated among the accounts specified for the line in the Gen. Jnl. Allocation table. The balance on the account is set to zero. Remember to fill in the **Allocation %** field on the **Allocations** page. For more information, see [Allocating Recurring Journal Amounts to Several Accounts](#allocating-recurring-journal-amounts-to-several-accounts).|
|RF Reversing Fixed|The amount on the journal line remains after posting, and a balancing entry is posted on the next day.|
|RV Reversing Variable|The amount on the journal line is deleted after posting, and a balancing entry is posted on the next day.|
|RB Reversing Balance|The posted amount on the account on the line is allocated among the accounts specified for the line on the **Allocations** page. The balance on the account is set to zero, and a balancing entry is posted on the next day.|
|BD Balance by Dimension|The journal line allocates costs based on a G/L account's balance by dimension. You're prompted to set the dimension filters to be used to calculate the source G/L account's balance by dimension from which you want to allocate costs. As an alternative, choose the **Set Dimension Filters** action later.|
|RBD Reversing Balance by Dimension|The journal line allocates costs based on a G/L account's reversing balance by dimension. You're prompted to set the dimension filters to use to calculate the source G/L account's balance by dimension from which you want to allocate costs. You can also choose the **Set Dimension Filters** action later.|

> [!NOTE]  
> The VAT fields can be filled in on either the recurring journal line or on the allocation journal line but not on both. That is, they can be filled in on the **Allocations** page only if the corresponding lines in the recurring journal are not filled in.

### Recurring Frequency field

This date formula field determines how often to post the entry on the journal line, and it must be filled in. Learn more at [Use Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas).

#### Examples

If the journal line must be posted every month, enter **1M**. After every posting, the date in the **Posting Date** field will be updated to the same date in the next month.

If you want to post an entry on the last day of every month, you can take one of the following actions:

* Post the first entry on the last day of a month by entering 1D+1M-1D (1 day + 1 month - 1 day). With this formula, the posting date is calculated correctly regardless of how many days there are in the month.

* Post the first entry on any day of the month by entering 1M+CM. With this formula, the posting date will be after one full month + the remaining days of the current month.

### Expiration Date field

This field determines the date on which the line is posted for the last time. The line won't be posted after this date.

The advantage of using the Expiration Date field is that the line isn't deleted from the journal immediately. You can enter a later date so that you can use the line in the future.

If the field is blank, the line is posted every time until you delete it from the journal.

### Allocating recurring journal amounts to several accounts

On the **Recurring General Journals** page, you can choose the **Allocations** action to specify how to allocate amounts on the recurring journal line to several accounts and dimensions. Allocation acts as balancing account line for the recurring journal line.

Like a recurring journal, you enter an allocation one time and it stays in the allocation journal after posting. You don't need to enter amounts and allocations every time you post the recurring journal line.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use allocation accounts in journal batches that have an approval workflow for creating journal lines.

If the recurring method in the recurring journal is set to **Balance** or **Reversing Balance**, dimension value codes in the recurring journal are disregarded when the account is set to zero. If you allocate a recurring line to dimension values on the **Allocations** page, only one reversing entry is created.

> [!NOTE]
> If you allocate a recurring journal line that contains a dimension value code, don't enter the same code on the **Allocations** page. If you do, the dimension values will be incorrect.  

To allocate recurring journal amounts based on dimensions, set the **Recurring Method** field to **Balance by Dimension** or **Reversing Balance by Dimension**. If the recurring method in the recurring journal is set to **Balance by Dimension** or **Reversing Balance by Dimension**, dimension value codes in the recurring journal are considered when the account is set to zero. If you allocate a recurring line to dimension values on the **Allocations** page, reversing entries are created that match the number of dimension value combinations that the balance is comprised of. If you allocate account balance through a recurring journal that contains a dimension value code, remember to use **Balance by Dimension** or **Reversing Balance by Dimension** to ensure that the dimension values are correctly balanced or reversed from the source account.  

For example, your company has a couple of business units and a handful of departments that your controllers set up as dimensions. To speed up the purchase invoice entry process, you decide to require the accounts payable clerks to enter only business unit dimensions. Since each business unit has specific allocation keys for the Department dimension, such as based on the number of employees, you can use the **BD Balance by Dimension** or **RBD Reversing Balance by Dimension** recurring methods to reallocate expenses for each business unit to the right departments based on the allocation keys.  

> [!NOTE]
> Dimensions that you set on allocation lines are not automatically calculated, and you must specify which dimension values must be set on the allocation accounts. In case you want to preserve the link between the source account dimension and the allocation account dimension, we recommend that you use the [Cost Accounting](finance-about-cost-accounting.md) capabilities instead.

#### Example: Allocating Rent Payments to Different Departments

You pay rent monthly, so you enter the amount on the cash account on a recurring journal line. On the **Allocations** page, you can use the Department dimension to divide the expense among several departments. For example, according to the number of square feet that each department occupies. The calculation is based on the allocation percentage on each line. You can allocate in different ways:

* Enter different accounts on different allocation lines to divide rental expense among several accounts.
* Enter the same account but use different dimension value codes for the Department dimension on each line.

[!INCLUDE [rev-general-journal](includes/rev-general-journal.md)]

### Calculate the reversal date

When using recurring general journals to post accruals at the end of a period, it's important to have full control over reversal entries. On the **Recurring General Journals** page, the **Reversal Date Calculation** field lets you control the date that reversal entries are posted when reversal recurring methods are used.

#### Example

Accruals are typically posted with **Fixed**, **Variable**, or **Balance** recurring methods on the journal line. The posting date of the posted amount on the account on journal line is calculated using the recurring frequency. The posting date for the balancing entry is calculated using the **Reversal Date Calculation** field, as follows:

* If the field is blank, the balancing entry will be posted the next day.
* If the field contains a date formula (for example, **5D** for five days), the balancing entry is posted with a posting date calculated using the reversal date calculation.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the **Reversal Date Calculation** field is not available on the **Recurring General Journals** page. To use the field, you must add it by personalizing the page. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Work with standard journals

When you create journal lines that you know you're likely to create again later, you can save them as a standard journal before you post the journal. The same applies for item journals and general journals.

> [!NOTE]
> Standard journals might not contain all of the fields you want to include in the resulting ledger entries. For example, if you're using a standard general journal to register a payment, the ledger entries won't contain the Payment Method Code field.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedures refer to the item journal, but the information also applies to the general journal.

### To save a standard journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter one or more journal lines.
3. Select the journal lines that you want to reuse.
4. Choose the **Save as Standard Journal** action.
5. In the **Save as Standard Item Journal** request page, define a new or existing standard item journal that the lines should be saved in.

    If you have one or more standard item journals, and you want to replace one of them with the new set of item journal lines, in the **Code** field, select the item journal.
6. Choose **OK** to verify that you want to replace the content of the existing standard item journal.
7. To save the values in the **Unit Amount** field of the standard item journal, choose the **Save Unit Amount** field.
8. To save the values in the **Quantity** field, choose the **Save Quantity** field.
9. Choose **OK** to save the standard item journal.

When you save the standard item journal, the Item Journal page displays so you can post it.

### To reuse a standard journal

> [!NOTE]
> Standard journals don't always have the same fields as general journals. When you use the Get Standard Journals action to copy the fields to the general journal, the general journal might have less information than if you created it manually. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Get Standard Journals** action.
3. To review a standard item journal before you select it for reuse, choose the **Show Journal** action.

    Changes you make in a standard item journal are implemented right away, and they'll be there next time you open or reuse the standard item journal. Be sure that the change is important enough to generally apply. Otherwise, make the specific change in the item journal after the standard item journal lines are added. See step 4.
4. On the **Standard Item Journals** page, select the standard item journal to reuse, and then choose **OK**.

    The item journal contains the lines you saved. If the item journal already has lines, the new lines appear after them.

    If you didn't turn on the **Save Unit Amount** toggle when you saved the journal, the **Unit Amount** field on lines added from the standard journal contain the value from the **Unit Cost** field on the item card.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you turned on the **Save Unit Amount** or **Save Quantity** toggles when you saved the journal, make sure the new values are correct before you post the item journal.
    >
    > If the inserted item journal lines contain saved unit amounts that you don't want to post, you can adjust it to the current value of the item.

5. Select the item journal lines you want to adjust, and then choose the **Recalculate Unit Amount** action. This action updates the Unit Amount field with the current unit cost of the item.
6. Choose the **Post** action.

## To renumber document numbers in journals

To avoid posting errors caused by the document number, you can use the **Renumber Document Numbers** action before you post a journal.

In all journals that are based on the general journal, the **Document No.** field is editable so that you can specify different document numbers for different journal lines or the same document number for related journal lines.

If the **No. Series** field on the journal batch is filled, then the posting function in general journals requires that the document number on individual or grouped journal lines be in sequential order. Just choose the **Renumber Document Numbers** action, and relevant **Document No.** fields are then updated. If related journal lines are grouped by document number before you used the function, they remain grouped, but might be assigned a different document number.  

This function also works on filtered views.

Renumbering document numbers respects related applications, such as a payment application made from the document on the journal line to a vendor account. Accordingly, the **Applies-to ID** and **Applies-to Doc. No.** fields are updated on the ledger entries.

### To renumber documents in journals

The following procedure is based on the **General Journals** page, but applies to all other journals that are based on the general journal, such as the **Payment Journals** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. When you're ready to post the journal, choose the **Renumber Document Numbers** action.

Values in the **Document No.** field are changed, where required, so that the document number on individual or grouped journal lines are in sequential order. After documents are renumbered, you can post the journal.

# Work with recurring revenue in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

Many companies are moving from a business revenue model where revenue is made from a customer's one-time purchase to a subscription model where revenue is made on a recurring basis in return for consistent access to the delivery of a good or service.
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has the following options for automating how you send subscription invoices to your customers and register recurring revenue. 

## Register revenue with a recurring general journal

A recurring journal is a general journal with specific fields for managing transactions that you post frequently with few or no changes, such as rent, subscriptions, electricity, or heat. Using these fields for recurring transactions, you can post both fixed and variable amounts. 
With a recurring journal, entries that are posted regularly need to be typed in only once. That is, the accounts, dimensions and dimension values, and so on, that you enter will remain in the journal after posting. If any adjustments are necessary, you can make them with each posting.

### Why use this option

With this option, you define flexible invoicing periods with [Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas).

However, with this option, you can't print and send invoices in the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

For more information, see [Work with Recurring Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md#work-with-recurring-journals).  

## Create multiple invoices based on a recurring project journal

The recurring job journal is a more advanced alternative to the general journal. You define Items, Resources, and G/L Accounts that must be repeated for each job and you specify the frequency of recurrence.  

After posting a recurring project journal, you can create multiple invoices with the **Create Job Sales Invoice** task. You can review and post created invoices in the **Sales Invoices** page.

### Why use this option

With this option, you follow the standard invoicing procedure with all the benefits of that, including standard and customer layouts for communication preferences. You can also define prices for each project individually.

However, for each new customer, you must create a new project and add lines to the recurring journal. 

For more information, see [Create project journal lines](projects-how-record-job-usage.md#to-create-project-journal-lines-manually) and [Create multiple project sales invoices](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md#to-create-multiple-project-sales-invoices).

## Create multiple invoices based on recurring sales lines

If you often need to create sales and purchase lines with similar information, you can set up recurring sales lines that you can then insert on recurring sales and purchase documents, for example, for recurring replenishment orders. Use the **Create Recurring Sales Invoices** batch job to create sales invoices according to recurring sales lines that are assigned to the customers and with posting dates within the valid-from and valid-to dates that you specify on the recurring sales lines.  

### Why use this option

With this option, you can assign the same recurring lines to multiple customers. You can define period of validity for the recurring sales lines for specific customer. You can assign multiple recurring lines to the same customer and all of them will be included in the invoice.

However, there's no way to set fixed prices for items because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the actual prices and discount valid on document date, trying to find best combination that gives the lowest price.  

For more information, see [Create Recurring Sales and Purchase Lines](sales-how-work-standard-lines.md).

## Recurring invoices with service contract

A service contract contains the service contract agreements between your customers and your company. A service contract includes service level agreements and the service items that you service as a part of the contract.  

You can define the starting date of the contract, the invoice period, whether or not the contract is prepaid, price update specifications if you plan to change prices while contract is active. You can use both service items or items in service contract lines.
You can create contract templates to define how to create certain types of contracts.  

### Why use this option

With this option, you use a part of the advanced service management functionality that not limited to issuing of recurring invoices but support repair shop and field service operations.

However, this option requires the Premium license. Setting up service management and maintaining it might not give huge advantages in simpler subscription scenarios.  

For more information, see [Work with Service Contracts and Service Contract Quotes](service-how-to-create-service-contracts-and-service-contract-quotes.md) and [Invoice several service contracts](service-how-create-invoices.md#to-invoice-several-service-contracts).

## Related features
There are several related capabilities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Blanket sales orders

A blanket sales order represents a framework for a long-term agreement between your company and your customer.
A blanket order is typically made when a customer has committed to purchasing large quantities that are to be delivered in several smaller shipments over a certain period of time. Often blanket orders cover only one item with predetermined delivery dates. The main reason for using a blanket order rather than a sales order is that quantities entered on a blanket order don't affect item availability, however it can be used for planning purposes.

#### Why use this option

With this option, you use the anticipated demand, so the information is considered during the normal planning routines. For more information, see [Demand Forecasts and Blanket Orders](design-details-central-concepts-of-the-planning-system.md#demand-forecasts-and-blanket-orders).  

However, the default version doesn't offer an out-of-the-box possibility to process multiple blanket orders in bulk.

For more information, see [Work with Blanket Sales Orders](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md).

### Recurring Orders (Norway)

You can use recurring orders to create blanket order templates so that sales orders can be created based on date intervals that you define. For example, if you deliver the same sales order every two weeks, you can use a blanket sales order and create recurring orders.
You can use recurring groups to define a range of parameters that show how you make the orders. These groups are assigned to blanket orders that have to be created regularly. To create the recurring orders, you'll have to periodically run the create recurring orders process. 

#### Why use this option

With this option, you can choose between fixed and "best" prices.

However, this is only available in Norway. Validity period can be defined on the recurring group level.

For more information, see [Recurring Orders](LocalFunctionality/Norway/recurring-orders.md).

### Recurring revenue and subscription billing by other providers

At [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/), you can get extensions for Business Central. Some extensions are provided by Microsoft, and other extensions are provided by other companies. The list of the extensions by other companies grows each month. So keep an eye out for [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646) and get apps to help you in your work in Business Central.

# Accounting and bookkeeping

Accounting is a critical function in any enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution, and also in most businesses. Accounting represents the process of recording and cataloging a company's financial transactions, and then retrieving, measuring, summarizing, and presenting the results by using different reports that are often required by local legislation. The primary goal of this process is to help the company's management understand the financials of the business and measure the results of the company's economic activities.

Bookkeeping is one part of the accounting process and involves regularly recording all financial transactions in a company. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is an ERP system that includes integrated tools to make bookkeeping easier in the system. Many actions can be done automatically.

This article provides an outline of bookkeeping processes, including the rules, procedures, and other guidelines in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The content of this article is intended to help accountants and bookkeepers complete their daily work in this ERP system. For additional help, a context-based assistant is incorporated into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# Reconcile customer payments with a cash receipt journal or from customer ledger entries

When you receive a cash payment from a customer or give a cash refund, you can apply the payment or refund to close open debits or credits. You can specify the amount to apply. For example, you can apply partial payments to customer ledger entries. Closing customer ledger entries keeps customer statistics, account statements, finance charges, and so on, up-to-date.

> [!TIP]  
> On the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, red font means that the related payment is past its due date. If overdue payments are becoming a problem, we can help you reduce their frequency. You can enable the **Late Payment Prediction Setup** extension, which uses a predictive model that we built in Azure Machine Learning to predict the timing of payments. These predictions help you reduce outstanding receivables and fine-tune your collections strategy. For example, if a payment is predicted to be late, you can adjust the terms of payment or the payment method for the customer. For more information, see [Late Payment Predictions](ui-extensions-late-payment-prediction.md).  

You can apply customer ledger entries in several ways:

* Enter information on the following pages:
   * The **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).
   * The **Payment Registration Setup** page. For more information, see [Reconcile Customer Payments from a List of Unpaid Sales Documents](receivables-how-reconcile-customer-payments-list-unpaid-sales-documents.md).
   * The **Cash Receipt Journals** page. For more information, see [To fill and post a cash receipt journal](#to-fill-and-post-a-cash-receipt-journal).
* By filling in the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field on sales credit memo documents. For more information, see [To apply a credit memo to a single customer ledger entry](#to-apply-a-credit-memo-to-a-single-customer-ledger-entry).
* By using the **Set Applies-to ID** action on a customer ledger entry. For more information, see [To apply a payment to a single customer ledger entry](#to-apply-a-payment-to-a-single-customer-ledger-entry).
* By using the **Apply Entries** action on the **Bank Deposit** page, and then entering the invoice number in the **Applies-to ID** field. For more information, see [Create Bank Deposits](bank-create-bank-deposits.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If the **Application Method** field on the customer card contains **Apply to Oldest**, payments are applied to the oldest open credit entry, unless you manually specify an entry. If the application method is **Manual**, you always apply entries manually.

## To fill and post a cash receipt journal

A cash receipt journal is a type of general journal. You can use it to post transactions to general ledger, bank, customer, vendor, and fixed assets accounts. You can apply the payment to one or more debit entries when you post the payment. You can also apply from the posted entries later.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Receipt Journals**, and then choose the related link.

On the ledger entry list, on the line that contains the ledger entry that was fully applied to, you can see that the **Open** check box isn't selected.  

> [!NOTE]  
> After you select an entry on the **Apply Customer Entries** page, or several entries by setting the **Applies-to ID**, the **Applied Amount** field on the journal line will contain the sum of the remaining amounts for the posted entries you've selected, unless the field contains something already. If you select **Apply to Oldest** in the **Application Method** field on the customer card, the application occurs automatically.

## To apply customer ledger entries in different currencies to one another

If you sell to a customer in one currency and receive payment in another currency, you can still apply the invoice to the payment.  

Here's an example. You apply Entry A in one currency to Entry B in another currency. The posting date on Entry A is used to find the exchange rate to use to convert amounts on Entry B. The exchange rate is found on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.  

Applying customer ledger entries in different currencies must be enabled. For more information, see [Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies](finance-how-enable-application-ledger-entries-different-currencies.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Receipts Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the journal you want, and fill in the first empty journal line using a currency code.
3. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
4. Select the line with the entry you want to apply to the entry in the cash receipt journal, choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action, and then select the entry you want to apply to.
5. Choose the **OK** button to return to the cash receipt journal.
6. Post the sales journal.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   When you apply entries in different currencies, the entries are converted to USD. Although the exchange rates for the two currencies are fixed, for example between USD and EUR, there may be a small residual amount when they are converted to USD. These small residual amounts are posted as gains and losses to the account specified in the **Realized Gains Account** or **Realized Losses Account** fields on the **Currencies** page. The **Amount (USD)** field is also adjusted on the vendor ledger entries.  

## To correct an application of customer entries
When you correct an application, correcting entries are created and posted for all entries. The correcting entries are the same as the originals but have an opposite sign in the **Amount** field. The correcting entries include all general ledger entries derived from the application. For example, the payment discount and currency gains/losses. The entries that the application closed are reopened.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant customer card.
3. Choose the **Ledger Entries** action.
4. Select the relevant ledger entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
5. Alternatively, choose the **Detailed Ledger Entry** action.
6. Select the application entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
7. Fill in the fields in the header, and then choose the **Unapply** action.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   If an entry has been applied by more than one application entry, you must unapply the latest application entry first.

# Publish a web service

Web services are a lightweight way to make application functionality available to different kinds of external systems and users. By default, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] exposes several objects as web services for better integration with other Microsoft services. You can add other web services as your business requires.  

Set up a web service in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and then publish the web service so that it's available to authenticated users. All authorized users can access metadata for web services, but only users who have sufficient permissions can access actual data.  

## Creating and Publishing a Web Service

The following steps explain how to create and publish a web service.  

### To create and publish a web service  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Web Services**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Web Services** page, choose **New**. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > **Codeunit** and **Page** are valid types for SOAP web services. **Page** and **Query** are valid types for OData web services. Starting with version 16.3, **Codeunit** is also a valid type for OData v4 web services, but then no URL is shown in the user interface. 
    > Also, if the database contains multiple companies, you can choose an object ID that is specific to one of the companies.  
    > Finally, the service name is visible to consumers of your web service and is the basis for identifying and distinguishing web services, so you should make the name meaningful.

3. Select the check box in the **Published** column.  

When you publish the web service, the **OData URL** and **SOAP URL** fields show the new URLs. However, for codeunits that are exposed as OData v4 unbound actions, the URL fields aren't shown.  

You can test the web service immediately by choosing the links in the **OData URL** and **SOAP URL** fields. Optionally, copy the value of the field and save it for later use. To test codeunits that are exposed as OData v4 unbound actions, follow the instructions in the [Verifying web service availability](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-creating-and-interacting-with-odatav4-unbound-action#verifying-web-service-availability) section in the developer content.

> [!NOTE]
> If the objects that you expose as web services must not be accessible from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you must mark the methods exposed in the code as `[Scope('OnPrem')]`. For more information, see [Scope Attribute](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods/devenv-scope-attribute).

After you publish a web service, it's available to external parties. You can verify the availability of that web service by using a browser, or choose the link in the **OData URL** and **SOAP URL** fields on the **Web Services** page. The following procedure illustrates how you can verify the availability of the web service for later use.  

### To verify the availability of a web service  

1. In your browser, enter the relevant URL. The following table illustrates the types of URLs that you can enter for different web service types.  

    > [!div class="mx-tdBreakAll"]
    > |Type|Syntax|Example|
    > |----------------|------|-------|
    > |SOAP|`https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/*version*/*tenant*/Production/WS/*CompanyName*/*entity*/` |`https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/7acc9d3d-d354-4616-8bbd-c4fc9f2b15b3/Production/WS/CRONUS%20USA%2C%20Inc./Page/InvoiceDocument`|
    > |OData V4|`https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/*version*/*tenant*/Production/ODataV4/Company('*CompanyName*')/*entity*`|`https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/7acc9d3d-d354-4616-8bbd-c4fc9f2b15b3/Production/ODataV4/Company('CRONUS%20USA%2C%20Inc.')/InvoiceDocument`<br/>    The company name is case-sensitive.|

2. Review the information that is displayed in the browser. Verify that you can see the name of the web service that you created.  

When you access a web service, and you want to write data back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify the company name. You can specify the company as part of the URI as shown in the examples; alternatively, specify the company as part of the query parameters. For example, the following URIs point to the same OData web service and are both valid URIs.  

```
https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v1.0/OData/Company('CRONUS International Ltd.')/Customer  
```

```
https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v1.0/OData/Customer?company='CRONUS International Ltd.'  
```

As the flow of goods in today's supply chain becomes more and more complex, the ability to keep track of items is increasingly important to the companies involved. Monitoring an item's transaction flow is a legal requirement in the business of medical and chemical supply, but other businesses may want to monitor products with warranties or expiration dates for customer service reasons.  

An item tracking system should provide a company with easy handling of serial and lot numbers, considering each unique piece of merchandise: when and where received, where stored, when and where sold. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has gradually expanded its coverage of this business requirement and today provides application-wide functionality and a solid core on which to develop extensions.

# Make check payments

You can issue electronic and manual checks in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Both methods use the payment journal to issue checks to vendors. You can also void checks and view check ledger entries.

The following procedure shows how to pay a vendor with a computer checks by:

- Applying the payment to the relevant vendor invoice.
- Printing the check.
- Posting the payment as paid.

These steps result in positive vendor ledger entries that are applied to negative bank ledger entries, and physical checks for processing in the bank.

You can pay with two types of checks. For both types, the **Bal. Account Type** or the **Account Type** field must contain **Bank Account**.

- **Computer Check**: Select this option if you want to print a check for the amount on the payment journal line. You must print the checks before you can post the journal lines.
- **Manual Check**: Select this option if you have created a check manually and want to create a corresponding check ledger entry for this amount. By using this option, you can't print the check.

> [!NOTE]  
> To make sure that your bank only clears validated checks and amounts, you can send them a file that contains vendor, check, and payment information. To learn more, go to [Export a Positive Pay file](finance-how-positive-pay.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your printer must be correctly set up with the check forms, and you must define which check layout to use. To learn more, go to [Select a Check Layout](finance-how-define-check-layouts.md). Alternatively, you can send the check as a PDF file, for example.  

You can print up to 10 invoices on a page for a check stub. If a check applies to more than 10 invoices, when you print the stub we void the check on the first page and print the word VOID on the check. We then print the remainder of the invoices and the total check amount on the second page.

## To pay a vendor invoice with a check

The following describes how to pay a vendor by check. The steps are similar to refund a customer by check.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the payment journal lines. To learn more, go to [Record Payments and Refunds](payables-how-post-payments-refunds.md).
3. In the **Payment Method Code** field, select **Check**.
4. Choose the **Print Check** action.
5. On the **Check** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. If your printer is set up to print checks, choose the **Print** button. Otherwise, choose the **Send to** button, select the **PDF Document** option, choose the **OK** button, and then print the PDF document.

    You can now send the physical checks to the vendors.
7. Choose the **Post** action.

    The payment is applied to the vendor and paid. Fully applied vendor ledger entries and bank ledger entries are created.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want to print and pay checks in more than one currency from different bank accounts, you must run the **Print Check** batch job separately for each currency and specify the appropriate bank account.

## To cancel printed checks that aren't posted

You can cancel non-posted checks after they have been printed by using the **Void Check** action on the **Payment Journal** page.

1. On the **Payment Journal** page, choose the **Void Check**, and then choose which checks to cancel.

## To void checks

After you post a check payment, you can only cancel (void) a check from the resulting bank ledger entries.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the check is applied to an invoice, unapply the payment first so that the invoice can be repaid. To learn more, go to [To unapply an application of vendor entries](payables-how-apply-purchase-transactions-manually.md#to-unapply-an-application-of-vendor-entries). The steps are the same for customers. After you unapply the payment, void the check. If the check was printed but didn't pay an invoice, then choose **Void Check Only** as described in this section.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant bank account, and then choose the **Check Ledger Entries** action.
3. On the **Check Ledger Entries** page, choose the **Void Check** action.
4. Select the **Void Check Only** checkbox.
5. Choose the **OK** button.

## To view a summary of posted checks

If you want to review posted checks, for example to verify multiple checks paid to one vendor, you can use the **Bank Account - Check Details** report.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Account - Check Details**, and then choose the related link.
2. Set filters as relevant, and then choose the **Preview** button.

# Analyze data in lists with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how to use *analysis assist* to help you analyze data on list pages.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## About analysis assist

Analysis assist is a Copilot for the [analysis mode](analysis-mode.md) on list pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Analysis mode provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. To analyze data in analysis mode, you create an *analysis* tab where you transform the data to display the desired aggregations and summarizations. For example, you arrange fields in rows and columns, specify filters, sort columns, and pivot on fields. With analysis assist, instead of doing this task manually, you achieve much of the same&mdash;or least as a start&mdash;by using words. By expressing the structure you want in natural language, like "sort on quantity from smallest to largest" or "show average cost per category," analysis assist uses AI to generate a suggested layout on an analysis tab.

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-language-support.md)]

## Prerequisites

- An administrator must activate the **Analyze list** capability on the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page and grand users permissions to use analysis mode. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).  

## Get started

1. Open the list page you want to analyze.

   For example, to work with the **Items** page, select the ![Magnifying glass that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png) icon (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>), enter *items*, and then choose the related link.

1. You can start analyzing data with Copilot directly from the list page or by first entering analysis mode. To get started, do one of the following steps:

    - In the action bar at the top of the page, select ![Shows the copilot icon](media/copilot-icon.png) **Copilot** > **Analyze list**.
    - In the action bar at the top of the page, select ![Shows the enter analysis mode icon](media/analysis-mode-icon.png) **Enter analysis mode**, then select ![Shows the copilot icon](media/copilot-icon.png) **Copilot** > **Create new analysis**.

1. In the **Analyze Items** window, enter a description of the layout you want. This description is known as a *prompt*.

    ![Shows the analysis assist Copilot](media/analysis-assist.svg)

    > [!TIP]
    > For help in writing a prompt, select ![Shows the view prompt icon](media/prompt-guide-icon.png) **Prompt guide**, and choose one of the options to get you started. The text in brackets `[ ]` is shown only as an example and isn't included in the Copilot window.

1. Select **Generate** and then wait while Copilot generates the layout on new analysis tab.
1. Review the results on the new analysis tab.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you navigate away from the new analysis tab (such as going to another analysis tab or page), the new analysis tab is automatically saved and Copilot closes.

1. If you want to change the generated analysis, you can do one of these steps:

   - To build on the previous instructions, enter the information in the **Add more details about the analysis** box, then select the ![Show the adjust arrow](media/analysis-assist-adjust-button.png) **Adjust** arrow. Copilot remembers your previous instructions and uses them to make adjustments.

     ![Shows the analysis assist history buttons](media/analysis-assist-paging.svg)

   - To manually adjust the layout, you can interact directly with the columns, data area, and analysis filters. For example, you can adjust a filter and remove a column, and Copilot remains available in case you want assistance with building on your manual adjustments and previous instructions.
   - To start from scratch by adding new instructions, select the ![Shows the edit prompt pencil icon](media/edit-pencil.png) **Edit prompt:**, add the details to the prompt, and then select **Generate**.

1. Use **< Back** and **> Next** at the top of the Copilot window to review the different layouts you created as you made adjustments for this analysis tab. You can go back to any adjustments that you or Copilot made to the tab since you created it.

1. If you want to save the analysis tab, select **Keep it**. If you don't want to save it, select **Discard**.

## Prompt tips and examples

Creating effective prompts for Copilot is essential to get accurate and relevant analysis suggestions. There are also ways to minimize text you add in prompts to make it faster when typing. Here are some tips and guidelines followed by some examples:

- Be concise and avoid long sentences or multiple sentences.
- Make sure field names used in prompts are somewhat close to actual field names on the page.
- Use natural language, expressing the data structure you want in a friendly and conversational manner.
- Use common keywords, phrases, and terms used in data analysis, like `group by`, `sum`, `sort by`, and so on.
- If the initial response isn't what you want, add follow-up instructions or rephrase the last instruction.
- Common abbreviations are acceptable.
- Letter case isn't important.

### Examples

These following prompt examples use analysis assist on the **Items** list. The items page includes three summable fields for analysis: **Quantity on Hand**, **Unit Cost**, **Unit Price**.

Prompt: `Show low-stock items by category`

This prompt can be used to group item records by their assigned category, filtering items to only those items with low stock. Copilot suggests a definition for low inventory and applies a filter such as "Quantity on Hand less than 10". In this case, the items list doesn't display the **Category** field, Instead, Copilot brings that field into the analysis tab so that you don´t need to go through the manual effort of personalizing the page.

Prompt: `Show items by brand and unit of measure`

This prompt tries to show totals for all summable fields, grouped by brand and the **Base Unit of Measure** field. But in this case, "brand" doesn't match any field name, so Copilot probably can't find a matching field. It then asks you to rephrase the prompt and try again.

Prompt: `Show items by type and uom`

This prompt  shows totals for all summable fields, grouped by the **Type** field and **Base Unit of Measure** field. In this prompt, the abbreviation `uom` is used instead of writing out "unit of measure". Copilot is often able to interpret abbreviations or alternate names and match them to fields on the list.

Prompt: `Show total quantity per type per UoM`

This prompt creates a pivot table on the **Quantity on Hand** field per **Base Unit of Measure** per **Type**.

## How Copilot works with fields for analysis assist

Copilot can use any of the visible or hidden fields on the list page and add them as columns to the analysis tab layout. Hidden fields are those fields that you would typically add to the list by personalizing the page.

When Copilot determines that a hidden field is useful for your analysis tab, the field is shown as a column in the tab layout. It's also shown in the **Columns** pane so that you can hide or reorder it, or add it to any other analysis tabs for this list.  

> [!NOTE]
> If an administrator has turned off personalization for your profile (role), Copilot isn't able to use hidden fields from the list.

Copilot can't reach fields that are on the table but not on the page, and it can't use fields from other pages.

# Set Up Customer Price Groups
  
Sales prices can be made dependent on the customer groups to which you sell. These are called customer price groups.

Before you set up customer price groups, you must decide how many groups you want and which customers will belong to each group.  

## How to create sales prices for a group of customers  

When you have agreed on the prices that the group of customers will pay for certain items, you register the agreement for the individual items on the lines in the **Sales Prices** page.

### To create sales prices for a group of customers

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer Price Groups**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Select the line for the customer price group. If a line does not already exist you can create a new line. Select **New** to create a new entity and give it a name.  
    
    For the selected line, verify the contents of the fields **Allow Line Disc.**, **Allow Invoice Disc.**, **Price Includes Tax** and **Tax Bus. Posting Gr. (Price)**. 
  
3. Select the **Navigate** action, and choose **Sales Prices**. The **Sales Prices** page opens. The **Sales Type** field will be filled in with **Customer Price Group**.  
  
4. Fill in the **Sales Code** with the sales code you selected on the previous page.  
  
5. Fill in the fields on the lines with the **Item No.**, **Unit of Measure Code**, and the agreed **Unit Price**. You can also show the **Variant Code** column and specify the **Variant Code** if there are several variants of the item.  
  
6. If the customer group needs to purchase a minimum quantity in order to gain the price agreed on, fill in the **Minimum Quantity** field.  

7. If required, enter the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** of the price agreement.  
  
8. If relevant, you can also specify the **Currency Code**.

Repeat steps 4 through 8 for each item that you want to create a Sales Price for.

## How to enter customer price group codes on customer cards  

After you have set up the customer price groups, you can enter the customer price group codes on the customer cards.

### To enter customer price group codes on a customer card  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Open the relevant **Customer Card** for a customer that you want to be part of a customer price group.  

3. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, in the **Customer Price Group** field, select the **Customer Price Group** code.

# Schedule jobs to adjust and reconcile inventory cost

Schedule Jobs for automatic cost adjustment with the general ledger, posting to the general ledger are turned on by default.
However, as data accumulates over time that might impact performance. To reduce the load on the application, it's often helpful to use job queue entries to move tasks to run in the background.

## Move the task of adjusting item costs to the background with the help of assisted setup

Creating the job queue entries can be tricky, even for an experienced consultant, so we have an assisted setup guide to make the process easier for adjusting item costs.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Inventory Setup** page, toggle the **Automatic Cost Posting** field, or specify **Never** in the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field.  
3. In the notification that now displays at the top of the page, choose the **Schedule Job Queue Entry** link. This opens the **Schedule Cost Adjustment and Posting** assisted setup guide.  
4. Specify the task that you want to schedule.  

  > [!NOTE]
  > You cannot create a new job queue entry if a job queue entry for the specified task already exists.

5. Select the **View job queue entries when finished** field to review and adjust settings. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

## To create a job queue entry for adjusting and reconciling inventory cost manually

Alternatively, you can create job queue entries manually. The following procedure shows how to set the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job to automatically run daily, but the same steps apply to the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Object Type to Run** field, choose *Report*.  
4. In the **Object ID to Run** field, choose *795*, **Adjust Cost - Item Entries**.  
5. In the **Next Run Date Formula** field, enter *1D*.
6. In the **Starting Time** field, enter *2 AM*.
7. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action.

Now, inventory cost will be updated every night.  

To schedule a task for reconciling inventory with the general ledger, choose Codeunit 2846 **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**.

> [!TIP]
> To avoid locking, do not schedule tasks for the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** codeunit, and tasks for posting sales or purchasing transactions at the same time. Also, make sure that they use same job queue category.

# Set up unrealized VAT for cash-based accounting

If you're using cash-based accounting methods, you can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to handle unrealized VAT.

## To use general ledger accounts for unrealized VAT

You can choose to have VAT amounts calculated and posted to a temporary general ledger account when an invoice is posted, and then posted to the correct general ledger account and included in VAT statements when the actual payment of the invoice is posted. Before you can do this, you must complete the [VAT posting setup](finance-setup-vat.md).

To use accounts for unrealized VAT, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, and enter **General Ledger Setup**.
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, select the **Unrealized VAT** check box.
3. Choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), and enter **VAT Posting Setup**.
4. On the **VAT Posting Setup** page, choose the VAT posting group, and then choose the **Edit** action.
5. In the **Unrealized VAT Type** field, choose an option to specify how to allocate payments to the invoice amount (excluding VAT) and the VAT amount itself, and how to transfer VAT amounts from the unrealized VAT account to the realized account. The following table describes the options.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Blank | Choose this option if you don't want to use the unrealized VAT feature. |
| Percentage | Payments cover both VAT and the invoice amount in proportion to the payment's percentage of the remaining invoice amount. The paid VAT amount is transferred from the unrealized VAT account to the realized VAT account. |
| First | Payments cover VAT first and then invoice amounts. In this case, the amount transferred from the unrealized VAT account to the VAT account will equal the amount of the payment until the total VAT has been paid. |
| Last | Payments cover the invoice amount first and then VAT. In this case, no amount will be transferred from the unrealized VAT account to the VAT account until the total amount of the invoice, excluding VAT, has been paid. |
| First (Fully Paid) | Payments will cover VAT first (like the _First_ option), but no amount will be transferred to the VAT account until the full amount of VAT has been paid. |
| Last (Fully Paid) | Payments will cover invoice amount first (like the _Last_ option), but no amount will be transferred to the VAT account until the full amount of VAT has been paid. |

6. In the **Sales VAT Unreal. Account** field, choose the account for unrealized sales VAT.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The VAT amount will be posted to this account, and stay there until the customer payment is posted. The amount is then transferred to the account for sales VAT.
7. In the **Purch. VAT Unreal. Account** field, enter the general ledger account for unrealized purchase VAT.

> [!NOTE]  
> The VAT amount will be posted to this account, and stay there until the customer payment is posted. The amount is then transferred to the account for purchase VAT.

# Design Details: Item Tracking Lines Page
Item tracking records and reservation records are created in the reservation system, and their availability is calculated dynamically. Data that is entered on the **Item Tracking Lines** page is managed in a temporary version of the **Tracking Specification** table. When the page is closed, the active data is committed to the **Reservation Entry** table and the historic data is committed to the **Tracking Specification** table. For more information, see [Design Details: Active versus Historic Item Tracking Entries](design-details-active-versus-historic-item-tracking-entries.md).  
  
Lookups from the **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields show availability based on both the **Item Ledger Entry** table and the **Reservation Entry** table, with no date filter. The matrix of quantity fields on the header of the **Item Tracking Lines** page dynamically displays the quantities and sums of item tracking numbers that are being entered on the lines of the page. The quantities must correspond to those of the document line, which is indicated by **0** in the **Undefined** fields in the header of the page.  
  
To coordinate the flow of serial and lot numbers through inventory, the following rules exist for entering data on the **Item Tracking Lines** page:  
  
* For both inbound and outbound item tracking lines, you cannot enter a serial number, with or without a lot number, more than once in the same instance of the **Item Tracking Lines** page. If you try to enter any combination of serial or lot numbers that is already present on the page, then an error message blocks the data entry.  
* For inbound item tracking lines, you cannot post the related document if an item of the same variant and with the same serial number is already in inventory. If you try to post a positive line for an inventory item with the same variant and serial number, then an error message blocks the posting. However, for both inbound and outbound item tracking lines on open documents, you can have the same combination of serial or lot numbers that relate to different source document lines, that is, existing in different instances of the **Item Tracking Lines** page until the related document is posted.  
* If the item is set up for serial number-specific tracking or lot number- specific tracking, then you cannot post an outbound document line unless an item with the defined serial or lot number exists in inventory. If you try to post an outbound document line for an item with a serial lot number that is not in inventory, then an error message blocks the posting.  
  
The rules for entering data on the **Item Tracking Lines** page also support the coupling principles that govern order tracking, planning, and reservation. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Tracking and Planning](design-details-item-tracking-and-planning.md).

# About production orders

Use production orders to manage the conversion of purchased materials into manufactured items. Production orders route work through various work or machine centers on the shop floor.  

Before they start production, most companies do supply planning, typically once a week, to calculate how many production orders and purchase orders they need fulfill sales demand. Purchase orders supply the required components according to the end item's bill of materials (BOM).

Production orders are central components in manufacturing, and contain the following information:  

- Products planned for manufacturing  
- Materials required for the planned production orders  
- Materials that are already selected  
- Products that were manufactured in the past  
- Materials that were used in previous manufacturing operations  

Production orders are the starting points for:  

- Planning future manufacturing  
- Controlling current manufacturing  
- Tracking of finished manufacturing  

## Production order creation  

You can create production orders on an order-by-order basis manually on the **Production Order** page, or generate them from the **Sales Order Planning** or **Order Planning** pages. You can also create multiple orders from the **Planning Worksheet** page.  

You create production orders using information from:  

- Items  
- Production BOMs
- Routings  
- Machine centers  
- Work centers  

## Reserving and tracking production orders to their source

Production orders are automatically reserved and tracked to their source when you create them from:  

- The [Planning Worksheet](production-how-to-run-mps-and-mrp.md) page.
- The [Sales Order Planning](production-how-to-create-production-orders-from-sales-orders.md) page.
- The [Order Planning](production-how-to-plan-for-new-demand.md) page.  
- The [Replan](production-how-to-replan-refresh-production-orders.md) action on production orders.  

To learn more, go to [Track Relations Between Demand and Supply](production-how-track-demand-supply.md).

If you create production orders by other means, they aren't automatically reserved and tracked.

## Production order status  

A production order can have one of the following statuses:

- Simulated
- Planned
- Firm Planned
- Released
- Finished

The status of a production order controls what you can do with it, and the form and content of the production. Production orders display on different pages according to their status. You can't change the status of a production order manually. To change the status of an order, use the **Change Status** action on the production order or use the **Change Production Order Status** page to change the status of one or orders in one go.

The **Change Status** action is available for the following types of orders:

- Simulated production orders
- Planned production orders
- Firm planned production orders
- Released production orders

> [!TIP]
> A confirmation dialog with additional questions displays for each order individually. If there are multiple orders with partial output or consumption, confirm each one separately.

If the status of orders can't change, they're skipped. The **Error Message** page shows the orders that were skipped and the reasons.  

### Simulated production order  

A simulated production order is unique because of the following characteristics:  

- It's a simulation you can use for quotes and costing. For example, when the Research and Development department wants a cost estimate for a proposed item. A simulated production order serves as an example of a production order.  
- They don't influence the planning of orders. MPS and MRP don't consider and aren't affected by simulated production orders. Also, you can't use a simulated production order as a template because it disappears when you change its status.  

### Planned production order  

A planned production order is unique because of the following characteristics:  

- You can automatically create a planned production order from a sales order.  
- Planned production orders are like released production orders and provide input to planning by showing the total capacity requirements by work center or machine center.  
- A planned production order represents the best estimate of the future load for the work center or machine center load based on available information. Typically, they're generated from planning, but you can also manually create them. However, they're erased the next time you run planning so it isn't practical to create them manually.  
- Their generation in planning results in a suggested "planned order release" that includes the quantity, release date, and due date. The planning system logic is based on the replenishment system, reorder policies, and order modifiers that it encounters in the net requirement planning process.  
- The load for each work center or machine center on the planned production order's routing shows their effect.  

### Firm planned production order  

A firm planned production order is unique because of the following characteristics:  

- You can automatically create a firm planned production order from a sales order.  
- A firm planned production order acts as a placeholder in the planning schedule for a future project released to the floor.  
- You can generate them during planning, create them manually, or create them from sales orders. They aren't erased during subsequent planning.  
- Their generation in planning results in a suggested "planned order release" that includes the quantity, release date, and due date. The planning system logic is based on the replenishment system, reorder policies, and order modifiers that it encounters in the net requirement planning process.  
- The load for each work center or machine center on the firm planned production order's routing show their effect.  

### Released production order  

The released production order is unique, based on the following characteristics:  

- You can automatically create a released production order from a sales order.  
- A released production order doesn't necessarily mean that materials are picked or the project moves to its first operation.  
- People typically create a released production order immediately after they enter the sales order in make-to-order (MTO) environments.  
- You can use a released production order to record the actual material consumption and product output. In addition, automatic flushing of consumption and product output only occur for released production orders.  

### Finished production order  

A finished production order is unique, based on the following characteristics:  

- A finished production order is typically one that is manufactured.  
- Finishing the production order is an important task in completing the costing lifecycle of the produced item. After you finish a production order, you can adjust and reconcile costing.  
- Finished production orders are used for reporting and to support the ability to track back to other orders (for example, sales, production, and purchases). The ability to track back to a finished production order allows you to review the detailed history.  
- You can't change finished production orders.  

#### Reopen a finished production order to make corrections

After you complete a production order and set its status to **Finished**, you might discover a mistake. For example, you might find that consumption is missing or the item tracking information is incorrect. To make sure that your inventory and cost transactions are correct, use the **Reopen** action on the **Finished Production Orders** page to make adjustments. However, to protect your data there are a few restrictions:

- You can only reopen an order one time.
- You can't reopen an order that has no output and cost was written off to an adjustment account.

## Production order execution  

After you create and schedule a production order, you must release it to the shop floor so that work can start. While you work on an order, you record:  

- The materials that were picked or consumed.  
- The time spent working on the order.
- The quantity of the item produced.

You can record this information manually or through automatic reporting. The method depends on the selection in the **Flushing Method** field on the item and work center.  

### Material consumption  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers options for how to record material consumption. For example, you can record material consumption manually, which can be useful if you often substitute components or generate more scrap than you expected.  

Consumption of materials can be processed through the [consumption journal](production-how-to-post-consumption.md), or [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can record it automatically, which is known as automatic reporting (flushing). The **Manual**, **Forward**, and **Backward** reporting methods are available.

Manual consumption reporting uses consumption journals to specify material picking.  

Forward consumption reporting assumes the expected quantity of all materials for the entire order is consumed at the release of a production order, unless you use routing link codes. When you use routing link codes, the material consumed after the start of the operational step is recorded in the output journal. To forward flush the entire production order, you need to do two things:  

- All items in the top-level production BOM need to have forward flushing selected on their respective item card.  
- All routing link codes on the production BOM must be removed.  

Backward consumption reporting records the actual quantity of all material picked or consumed when the status of a production order is changed to *Finished,* unless using routing link codes. When you use routing link codes, the material is consumed after a quantity of the parent item is recorded for the operational step in the output journal.  

When you refresh the production order, the flushing method is copied from the item card. The flushing method for each production order component controls how and when you record consumption. Therefore, it's important to note that you can change flushing method for specific items directly on the production order. To learn more, go to [Flush Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md).

### Production output  

You can track the time spent working on a production order and the quantity produced. This information can help you determine the costs of production. Also, manufacturers who use a standard costing system might want to record actual information in order to help them develop better standards.  

Output can be processed through [output journals](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md), but can also be recorded automatically. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] copies the flushing method from the machine center or work center card to the production order routing when refreshing. As with material consumption, there are **Manual**, **Forward**, and **Backward** reporting methods for output.

The Manual method uses the output journal to specify time consumed and quantity produced.  

The Forward method records the expected output (and time), which is automatically recorded at the release of a production order. Routing link codes aren't a factor in the forward flushing of the output.  

Backward method records the expected output (and time), which is automatically recorded at the finish of a production order. Routing link codes aren't a factor in the back flushing of the output.  

### Posting consumption and output  

You can use any combination of automatic flushing and manually recorded information for both consumption and output. For example, you might want to automatically forward flush components, but still use a consumption journal to record scrap. Similarly, you might want to automatically record output, but use an output journal to record scrap of the parent item or extra time spent on the order.  

Finally, if you enter consumption and output manually, you need to determine the sequence in which you're going to record this information. You can record consumption first and use a shortcut method to enter the information, which is based on expected quantity of output. Or, you can enter output first, using the **Explode Routing** action. You would then record consumption based on actual quantity of output.  

### Production journals  

The [Production Journal](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md) combines the functions of a consumption journal and output journals into one journal, which is accessed directly from the released production order.  

The purpose of a production journal is to provide a single interface for you to register consumption and output from a production order.  

Production journals have a simple view and provide you with the ability to:  

- Easily record output and consumption related to a production order  
- Relate the components to operations  
- Relate actual operation data with the standard estimates on a production order routing and component lines  
- Post and print an overview of registered operation data for a production order  

Production journals do many of the same things as consumption and output journals. Dimensions, item tracking, and bin contents are handled in the same way.  

However, production journals differ from the consumption and output journals in the following ways:  

- You open them directly from a released production order line and they're preset with the relevant data.
- They let you define which types of components to handle based on a flushing method filter on the journal.  
- Quantities and times already posted for the order display at the bottom of the journal as actual entries.  
- Fields where data entry is irrelevant are blank and noneditable.  
- You can specify how output quantities are preset in the journal. For example, that the last operation must have zero as the output quantity.  
- A confirmation message displays if you exit a journal without posting your changes.  
- They display operations and components together in a structure that provides an overview of the production process.  

In the production journal, consumption quantities are posted as negative item ledger entries, output quantities are posted as positive ledger entries, and times spent are posted as capacity ledger entries.

# Purchases Overview (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Purchases Overview** report gives a clear picture of your purchasing activities. It highlights important metrics such as

- Total purchase amounts
- Outstanding liabilities
- Invoiced purchases

The report breaks down purchase quantities by location and item category, and provides vendor information to help with financial analysis, budget management, and compliance.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases Overview Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-overview.png":::

## Use the report

The report helps leadership and management teams track actual spending on purchasing activities, manage budgets, and evaluate vendor performance.

CEOs can use the report to keep track of purchasing activities. This report gives a clear picture of your total purchase amount, outstanding liabilities, and invoiced purchases. By analyzing purchase quantities by location and item category, and reviewing vendor information, you can gain valuable insights into your financial performance. With this information, you can make informed decisions about budget management and vendor relationships.

Purchasing managers can identify where you might be overspending or underspending. For example, you might notice that your organization spent a lot on a specific item category, but the quantity of purchases was lower than expected. You might review vendor contracts, find alternative vendors with better prices, or negotiate better terms with existing vendors. By taking these actions, you can optimize purchasing activities, reduce costs, and comply with the overall budget.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Purchases Overview* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)
- [**Outstanding Amount (excluding VAT)**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#outstanding-amount-excl-vat)
- [**Amount Received but Not Invoiced (excluding VAT)**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#amt-rcd-not-invd-excl-vat)
- [**Invoiced Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#invoiced-amount)

# About inventory costing
Managing inventory costs is concerned with recording and reporting business operating costs. It includes the reporting of manufacturing costs and inventory costs, that is, the value of items.  

 Central principles to understand are that costing methods define how items are valued when they leave inventory, that cost adjustment updates the cost of goods sold with related purchase costs posted after the sale, and that inventory values must be posted to dedicated G/L accounts at regular intervals.  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Count, adjust, and reclassify inventory using journals

To ensure that your quantities are correct, physically count all of the items in your inventory. Some businesses do an annual physical count, and others count all or only some items more often. After you count items, use journals to post the actual quantities to the general ledger. For example, when you valuate inventory at the end of a period.

To count some items more often than others, perhaps because of their value, use cycle counts. For cycle counts, assign special counting periods to the items. Learn more at [To do cycle counting](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-do-cycle-counting).

To adjust quantities after a physical count or other purposes, use an item journal to change the inventory ledger entries without posting transactions. You can also adjust the quantity for a single item on an item card.

To change attributes on item ledger entries, use an item reclassification journal. Typical attributes to reclassify include dimensions and sales campaign codes. You can also use reclassification journals for transfers by reclassifying bin and location codes. Special steps apply when you want to reclassify serial or lot numbers and their expiration dates. For more information, see [Work with Serial and Lot Numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md).

> [!NOTE]
> In multi-step processes, items are registered in bins as warehouse entries, not as item ledger entries. Therefore, you do counting, adjusting, and reclassifying in warehouse journals that support bins. Then you synchronize the new or changed warehouse entries with their related item ledger entries to reflect the changes in inventory quantities and values.

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel](includes/edit-in-excel.md)]

## To count physical inventory

To check whether the quantity registered is the same as the physical quantity in stock, count your physical inventory. That is, count the actual items on hand. Typically, counts happen at the end of a fiscal year, but some businesses count items more often. If there are differences, post the actual quantities to the item accounts before you do inventory valuation.

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure describes how to do a physical inventory using a journal on the **Phys. Inventory Journal** page. You can use documents on the **Physical Inventory Order** and **Physical Inventory Recording** pages. These documents offer more control and support for distributing the counting work to multiple employees. Learn more at [Count Inventory Using Documents](inventory-how-count-inventory-with-documents.md).<br /><br />
> Note that you can't use the document-based functionality to count items in bins or warehouse entries.

The counting process also involves the following tasks:

- Calculate the expected inventory.
- Print the report you want to use for the count.
- Enter and post the actual quantities.

Depending on your warehouse setup, count physical inventory in one of the following ways. For more information, see [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

- If your location doesn't use directed put-away and pick, use the **Phys. Inventory Journal** page. The procedure is similar to physical inventory without cycle counting.  
- If your location uses directed put-away and picks, use the **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal** page. Then use the **Item Journals** page to run the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** action. <!--We should say what to do on each of these pages.-->

### To calculate expected inventory in basic warehouse configurations

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Calculate Inventory** action from **Prepare**.
3. On the **Calculate Inventory** page, specify the conditions to use to create the journal lines, such as whether to include items that have zero recorded inventory.
4. Set filters if you only want to calculate inventory for certain items, bins, locations, or dimensions.
5. Choose the **OK** button.

> [!NOTE]  
> Item entries are processed according to the information that you specified, and lines are created in the physical inventory journal. Notice that the **Qty. (Phys. Inventory)** field has the same quantity as the **Qty. (Calculated)** field. You don't need to enter the counted quantity for items where these values match. However, if the quantity counted differs, enter the quantity that was counted.

### To print the report to be used when counting

1. On the **Physical Inventory Journals** page containing the calculated expected inventory, Choose the **Print** action from **Home**.
2. On the **Physical Inventory List** page, specify whether the report will show the calculated quantity and inventory items by serial and lot numbers.
3. Set filters if you only want to print the report for certain items, bins, locations, or dimensions.
4. Choose **Print**.

Warehouse employees can now count inventory and record any differences on the printed report.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take several days before printed reports come back for final processing and posting. When you specify and post actual counted inventory, the system adjusts inventory to reflect the difference between the expected and the actual counted inventory. You must keep the originally calculated journal lines and not recalculate the expected inventory, because the expected inventory may change and lead to incorrect inventory levels. If you need to issue multiple reports, such as for different locations or group of items, you must create and keep separate journal batches.

### To enter and post the actual counted inventory in basic warehouse configurations

1. On each line on the **Physical Inventory Journals** page where the actual inventory on hand, as determined by the physical count, differs from the calculated quantity, enter the actual inventory on hand in the **Qty. (Phys. Inventory)** field.
  
  > [!NOTE]  
  > If the physical count reveals differences caused by items posted with incorrect locations, don't enter the differences in the physical inventory journal. Instead, use a reclassification journal or a transfer order to redirect the items to the correct locations. 

2. To adjust the calculated quantities to the actual counted quantities, choose the **Post** action from **Home**.

    Posting creates item ledger entries and physical inventory ledger entries. Open the Item Card page for the item to find its physical inventory ledger entries.

3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
4. To verify the count, open the **Item Card** page for the item, and choose the **Phys. Inventory Ledger Entries** action from **Item**
1. .

### To calculate the expected inventory in advanced warehouse configurations

Synchronize item ledger and warehouse <!--warehouse what?--> before you count physical inventory. Otherwise, what you post to the physical inventory journal and item ledger is the physical inventory results combined with other warehouse adjustments for the items. Learn more at [Synchronize quantities in the item ledger and warehouse](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-synchronize-the-adjusted-warehouse-entries-with-the-related-item-ledger-entries).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Calculate Inventory** action to open the **Whse. Calculate Inventory** page.  
3. Set the filters to specify the items to count in the journal, and then choose **OK**.

   [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a line for each bin that meets the filter requirements. You can delete lines, but if you want to post the results as a physical inventory, count the item in all the bins that contain it.  

   If you only count an item in some bins but not others, you can enter differences and post them in the **Item Journal** page later by using the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** action.  

### To enter and post the actual counted inventory in advanced warehouse configurations

1. On the **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal** page, enter the actual quantities in the **Qty. (Phys. Inventory)** field.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **Qty. (Calculated)** field is filled in based on bin records. This quantity is copied to the **Qty. (Physical)** field on each line. If the quantities in these fields don't match, enter the actual quantity.  

2. After you enter all actual quantities, choose the **Register** action.  

    When you register the journal, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates two warehouse entries in the warehouse register for every line that was counted and registered:  

    - If the calculated and the actual quantities differ, a negative or positive quantity is registered for the bin, and a balancing quantity is posted to the location's adjustment bin.  
    - If the calculated quantity equals the physical quantity, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] registers **0** for both the bin and the adjustment bin. 

When you register physical inventory, you don't post to the item, physical inventory, or the value ledgers. However, the records are available for reconciliation when needed. To keep quantities accurate, after you count items in all bins, post the results.<!--physical inventory journal--> Learn more at [Synchronize quantities in the item ledger and warehouse](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-synchronize-the-adjusted-warehouse-entries-with-the-related-item-ledger-entries).

## To do cycle counting

You can count items as often as you'd like. For example, because they're more valuable or top sellers. Specify the counting frequency by assigning special counting periods to the items.

Depending on your warehouse setup, you can do cycle counting in the following ways. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

- If your location doesn't use directed put-away and picks, use the **Physical Inventory Journal** page. The steps are similar to counting physical inventory without cycle counting.  
- If your location uses directed put-away and picks, use the **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal** page. Then use the **Item Journals** page to run the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** action. <!--we should say what to do on each of these pages-->  

### To set up counting periods

Counting physical inventory is typically a recurring task, for example monthly, quarterly, or annually. You can set up the inventory counting periods you need and assign one to each item. Afterward, use the **Calculate Counting Period** action on the **Physical Inventory Journal** page to automatically create lines for the items.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Counting Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### To assign a counting period to an item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the item to which you want to assign a counting period.  
3. In the **Phys Invt Counting Period Code** field, select the counting period.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you're changing the counting period, a message displays information about the results of the change. Choose **Yes** to change the code and calculate the first counting period for the item. The next time you choose to calculate a counting period in the physical inventory journal, the item appears as a line on the **Phys. Invt. Item Selection** page. You can then count the item periodically.

### To start a count based on counting periods in basic warehouse configurations

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Calculate Counting Period** action.

    The **Phys. Invt. Item Selection** page shows items that need to be counted according to their counting periods.
3. Count the physical inventory. Learn more at [To count physical inventory](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-count-physical-inventory).

### To start a count based on counting periods in advanced warehouse configurations

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Calculate Counting Period** action.

    The **Phys. Invt. Item Selection** page show items need to be counted according to their counting periods.
3. Count the physical inventory. Learn more at [To count physical inventory](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-count-physical-inventory).  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > Count the item in all bins that contain it. If you delete bin lines that were retrieved for counting on the **Whse. Phys. Inventory** page, the count will be incorrect when you post it in a physical inventory journal.  

## To adjust the quantity of one item

After you do a physical count of an item, use the **Adjust Inventory** action to record the actual inventory quantity.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the item for which you want to adjust inventory, and then choose the **Adjust Inventory** action.
3. In the **New Inventory** field for the location, enter the result of the count.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

<!-- I don't see a "Quantity on Hand" field on the Item Card page. Should this point to the options for viewing availability?

The item’s inventory is adjusted. The new quantity is shown in the **Quantity on Hand** field on the **Item Card** page.-->

You can also use the **Adjust Inventory** action as an easy way to add purchased items to inventory if you don't use purchase invoices or orders to record your purchases. Learn more at [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> After you adjust inventory, update its current value. For more information, see [Revalue Inventory](inventory-how-revalue-inventory.md).

### To adjust the quantities of multiple items in basic warehouse configurations

On the **Item Journals** page, you can post item transactions directly to adjust inventory for purchases, sales, and positive or negative changes without using documents.

If you often use the item journal to post the same or similar journal lines, for example, for material consumption, the **Standard Item Journal** page can make this recurring work easier. For more information, see [Work with Standard Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md#work-with-standard-journals).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Choose the **Post** action to adjust the quantities.

### To adjust bin quantities in advanced warehouse configurations

If your location uses directed put-away and picks, use the **Warehouse Item Journal** page to post unplanned positive and negative quantity changes. For example, for items posted as missing that show up unexpectedly, or losses due to breakage.  

Warehouse item journals give you more levels of adjustment to make your quantities more precise. The warehouse knows how many items are on hand and where they're stored, but each adjustment isn't posted to the item ledger. Credits or debits are made to the real bin with the quantity adjustment. A balancing entry is made in an adjustment bin. The adjustment bin is a virtual bin with no real items. You specify the virtual bin in the **Invt. Adjustment Bin Code** field on **Location Card** pages.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Item Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the header information.  
3. In the **Item No.** field on the line, choose the item.  
4. Enter the bin in which you're putting the extra items or where items are missing.  
5. In the **Quantity** field, if you find extra items, enter a positive quantity. If items are missing, enter a negative quantity.  
6. Choose the **Register** action.

## To synchronize the adjusted warehouse entries with the related item ledger entries

Post the adjustment bin records in the item ledger for the defined periods. Some companies post daily adjustments to the item ledger, while others reconcile less often.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields on each journal line.  
3. Choose the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** action, and then add filters on the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** page. Adjustments are calculated only for the entries in the adjustment bin that meet the filter requirements.  
4. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the **Document No.** field with a number. The number displays on the item journal lines.
5. Choose **OK**. The positive and negative adjustments are totaled for each item, and lines are created in the item journal.  
6. Post the journal lines to enter the quantity differences in the item ledger. The quantities in the bins and the item ledger now match.

# Set up general inventory information

You specify your general inventory setup on the **Inventory Setup** page.

## To set up general inventory information

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Inventory Setup** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### To set up inventory valuation and costing

To record inventory costs correctly, you must set up various fields and pages before you make transactions that include item. Typically, businesses choose a specific costing method and apply that to inventory items, for example, to help them track the value of items on stock.  

|**Field**|**Details**|  
|------------|-------------|
|**Automatic Cost Posting**|Ensure that the cost is automatically posted to the general ledger whenever an inventory transaction is posted. The field is turned on by default to ensure that inventory values are always correct in the general ledger. Alternatively, you can manually post costs at regular intervals with the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job. You can also turn off automatic cost posting. A notification displays from which you can start an assisted setup guide to help you schedule tasks for the job queue. To learn more, go to [Reconcile Inventory Costs with the General Ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md).|
|**Automatic Cost Adjustment**| Specifies if item value entries are automatically adjusted when an item transaction is posted. The field is set to **Always** by default to ensure that inventory values are always correct, which in turn keeps your sales and profit statistics up to date. Cost adjustment forwards cost changes from inbound entries, such as purchases or production output, to the related outbound entries, such as sales or transfers. The adjustment is helpful for new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers and small businesses with relatively low inventory transaction levels. However, as a business grows and inventory levels increase, adjustments can slow down system performance. To minimize reduced performance during posting, select a time option to define how far back in time from the work date an inbound transaction can occur to potentially trigger adjustment of related outbound value entries. Alternatively, you can manually adjust costs at regular intervals with the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. You can also set the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field to **Never**. A notification displays from which you can start an assisted setup guide to help you schedule tasks for the job queue. To learn more, go to [Adjust Item Costs](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md).|
|**Expected Cost Posting to G/L**|Ensure that you post expected costs to the general ledger. The interim G/L accounts show an estimate of the amounts due and the cost of the traded items before you invoice them. To learn more, go to [Design Details: Expected Cost Posting](design-details-expected-cost-posting.md) and [Reconcile Inventory Costs with the General Ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md).|
|**Average Cost Calc. Type**|Define if the average cost is to be calculated per item only or per item for each stockkeeping unit and for each variant of the item. To learn more, go to [Design details: average cost](design-details-average-cost.md).|
|**Average Cost Period**|Select the period of time you would like application to use for calculating the weighted average cost of items that use the average costing method. To learn more, go to [Design details: average cost](design-details-average-cost.md).|
|**Default Costing Method**|Select the default costing method that determines whether an actual or a budgeted value is capitalized and used in the cost calculation. You can select a different costing method for a specific item either by selecting item template where costing method is defined or by manually selecting a different value on the **Item Card** page. To learn more, go to [Design details: costing methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).|

To learn more about costing in general, go to [Managing Inventory Costs](finance-manage-inventory-costs.md).  

If you want to include warehouse handling times in the order promising calculation on purchase lines, you can set it up as a default for inventory on the **Inventory Setup** page, and for your location. To learn more, go to [Calculate Order Promising Dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md).  

## Allow workers to post transactions at the same time

To allow people to post inventory transactions at the same time, you can enable the **Enable multiple users to post item ledger entries and value entries at the same time** feature on the **Feature Management** page. By default, the feature isn’t enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Similar features are available for project, resource, and warehouse entries. To learn more, go to:
>
> * [Allow multiple people to post project transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-jobs.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-project-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Allow multiple people to post resource transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-resources.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-resource-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Design details: Creating warehouse entries](design-details-warehouse-entries.md)

If you enable the feature, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns entry numbers for each table from `SequenceNumbers` in the database, which allows more people to post transactions at the same time. The result can be that sometimes inventory entries from two or more transactions are interleaved. For example, an item register might contain any or all of the entry tables, as shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="media/interleaved inventory tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the item register with several entry tables." lightbox="media/interleaved inventory tables.png":::

If you don’t enable the feature, when someone posts an inventory transaction the tables are locked and other users can’t post inventory transactions. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in each table and assigns a number that’s one higher. This numbering ensures that entries that belong to the same register are consecutive, but prevents other people from posting at the same time.

> [!NOTE]
> You might not want to enable the feature if you have a feature or extension that:
>
> - Relies on consecutive entry numbers.
> - Requires that tables are locked throughout the posting process.

# Use OCR to Turn PDF and Image Files into Electronic Documents

From PDF or image files that you receive from your trading partners, you can have an external OCR service (Optical Character Recognition) generate electronic documents that can be converted to document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can [send it to the OCR service from the **Incoming Documents** page](#to-send-a-pdf-or-image-file-to-the-ocr-service-from-the-incoming-documents-page).

As an alternative to sending the file from the **Incoming Documents** page, the OCR service can offer the option to [process files forwarded to a dedicated email address](#to-send-a-pdf-or-image-file-to-the-ocr-service-by-email). Then, when you receive the electronic document back, a related incoming document record is created automatically in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

After some seconds, the OCR service will send the processed file to the **Incoming Documents** page as an electronic document record that can be [converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor](#to-receive-the-resulting-electronic-document-from-the-ocr-service), a sales invoice, credit memo or a journal entry.

Because OCR is based on optical recognition, it's likely that the OCR service will interpret characters in your PDF or image files wrongly when it first processes a certain vendor's documents, for example. It may not interpret the company logo as the vendor's name or it may misinterpret the total amount on a receipt because of its layout. To avoid these errors going forward, you can correct the errors in a separate version of the **Incoming Document** page. Then you send the corrections back to the OCR service to train it to interpret the specific characters and fields correctly next time it processes a PDF or image document for the same vendor. For more information, see [Train the OCR service to avoid errors](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md#to-train-the-ocr-service-to-avoid-errors).

The traffic of files to and from the OCR service is processed by a dedicated job queue entry. This job queue is created automatically when you enable the external OCR service connection. For more information, see [Set Up Incoming Documents](across-how-setup-income-documents.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The OCR feature is provided by external providers. Choose a service package that is appropriate for your organization and/or country/region. Find services compatible with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and details on available features at [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646).

## To send a PDF or image file to the OCR service from the Incoming Documents page

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Documents**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a new incoming document record and attach the file. For more information, see [Create Incoming Document Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).  
3. On the **Incoming Documents** page, select one or more lines, and then choose the **Send to Job Queue** action.

   The value in the **OCR Status** field changes to **Ready**. The attached PDF or image file is sent to the OCR service by the job queue according to the schedule, if no errors exist.
4. Alternatively, on the **Incoming Documents** page, select one or more lines, and then choose the **Send to OCR Service** action to immediately send the files for processing.

   The value in the **OCR Status** field changes to **Sent**, if no errors exist.

## To send a PDF or image file to the OCR service by email

From your email application, you can forward an email to the OCR service provider with the PDF or image file attached. For information about the email address to send to, see the OCR service provider's web site.

Since no incoming document record exists for the file, a new record will be created automatically on the **Incoming Documents** page when the OCR service sends the resulting electronic document. For more information, see [Create Incoming Document Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If you work on a tablet or phone, you can send the file to the OCR service as soon as you have taken a photo of the document, or you can create an incoming document directly. For more information, see [Create an incoming document record by taking a photo](across-how-create-income-document-records.md#create-an-incoming-document-record-by-taking-a-photo).

## To receive the resulting electronic document from the OCR service

The electronic document that is created by the OCR service from the PDF or image file is automatically received into the **Incoming Documents** page by the job queue entry that is set up when you enable the OCR service.

If you aren't using a job queue, or you want to receive a finished OCR document sooner than per the job queue schedule, you can choose the **Receive from OCR Service** action. This option will get any documents that are completed by the OCR service.

> [!NOTE]  
> If the OCR service is set up to require manual verification of processed documents, then the **OCR Status** field will contain **Awaiting Verification**. In that case, perform the following steps to sign in to the OCR service website to manually verify an OCR document.

1. In the **OCR Status** field, choose the **Awaiting Verification** hyperlink.
2. On the OCR service website, sign in using the credentials of your OCR service account. For more information, see [Set up an OCR service](across-how-setup-income-documents.md#to-set-up-an-ocr-service).

   Information for the OCR document is displayed, showing both the source content of the PDF or image file and the resulting OCR field values.
3. Review the field values and manually edit or enter values in fields that the OCR service has tagged as uncertain.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The OCR process is completed and the resulting electronic document is sent to the **Incoming Documents** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], according to the job queue schedule.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for any other OCR document to be verified.

Now you can proceed to create document records for the received electronic documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], manually or automatically. For more information, see the next procedure. You can also [connect the new incoming document record to existing posted or non-posted documents](across-how-connect-disconnect-income-document-records.md) so that the source file is easy to access from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## To create a purchase invoice from an electronic document received from the OCR service

The following procedure describes how to create a purchase invoice record from a vendor invoice received as an electronic document from the OCR service. The procedure is the same when you create, for example, a general journal line from an expense receipt or a sales return order from a customer.

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Description** and **No.** fields on the created document lines will only be filled if you have first mapped text found on the OCR document to the two fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can do this mapping as item references, for document lines of type Item. For more information, see [Use Item References](inventory-how-use-item-cross-refs.md). You can also use the **Text-to-Account Mapping** function. For more information, see [Map text on an incoming document to a specific vendor, G/L, or bank account](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md#to-map-text-on-an-incoming-document-to-a-specific-vendor-account).

1. Select the line for the incoming document, and then choose the **Create Document** action.

A purchase invoice will be created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on the information in the electronic vendor document that you received from the OCR service. Information will be inserted in the new purchase invoice based on the mapping that you've defined as a reference or as text-to-account mapping.

Any validation errors, typically related to wrong or missing data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], will be shown on the **Errors and Warnings** FastTab. For more information, see [Handle errors when receiving electronic documents](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md#to-handle-errors-when-receiving-electronic-documents).

### To map text on an incoming document to a specific vendor account

For incoming documents, you typically use the **Map Text to Account** action to define that a certain text on a vendor invoice received from the OCR service is mapped to a certain vendor account. Going forward, any part of the incoming document description that exists as a mapping text means that the **Vendor No.** field on resulting document or journal lines of type *G/L Account* are filled with the vendor in question.

In addition to mapping to a vendor account or G/L accounts, you can also map text to a bank account. This option is useful, for example, for electronic documents for expenses that are already paid, and for which you want to create a general journal line that is ready to post to a bank account.

1. Select the relevant incoming document line, and then choose the **Map Text to Account** action. The **Text-to-Account Mapping** page opens.
2. In the **Mapping Text** field, enter any text that occurs on vendor invoices that you want to create purchase documents or journal lines for. You can enter up to 50 characters.
3. In the **Vendor No.** field, enter the vendor that the resulting purchase document or journal line will be created for.
4. In the **Debit Acc. No.** field, enter the debit-type G/L account that will be inserted on resulting purchase document or journal line of type G/L Account.
5. In the **Credit Acc. No.** field, enter the credit-type G/L account that will be inserted on resulting purchase document or journal line of type G/L Account.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Do not use the **Bal. Source Type** and **Bal. Source No.** fields in connection with incoming documents. They are used for automatic payment reconciliation only. For more information, see [Map Text on Recurring Payments to Accounts for Automatic Reconciliation](receivables-how-map-text-recurring-payments-accounts-auto-reconcilliation.md).
6. Repeat steps 2 through 5 for all text on incoming documents that you want to automatically create documents for.

## To handle errors when receiving electronic documents

1. On the **Incoming Documents** page, select the line for an electronic document received from the OCR service with errors, indicated by the *Error* value in the **OCR Status** field.
2. Choose the **Edit** action to open the **Incoming Document** page.
3. On the **Errors and Warnings** FastTab, select the message, and then choose the **Open Related Record** action.
4. The page that contains the wrong or missing data, such as a vendor card with a missing field value, opens.
5. Correct the error or errors as described in each error message.
6. Proceed to process the incoming electronic document by choosing the **Create Manually** action again.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for any remaining errors until the electronic document can be received successfully.

## To train the OCR service to avoid errors

Because OCR is based on optical recognition, the OCR service can wrongly interpret characters in your PDF or image files when it first processes documents from a certain vendor, for example. It may not interpret the company logo as the vendor's name or it may misinterpret the total amount on an expense receipt because of its layout. To avoid such errors going forward, you can correct data received by the OCR service and then send the feedback to the service.

The **OCR Data Correction** page, which you open from the **Incoming Document** page, shows the fields from the **Financial Information** FastTab in two columns, one with the OCR data editable and one with the OCR data read-only. When you choose the **Send OCR Feedback** button, the content of the **OCR Data Correction** page is sent to the OCR service. Next time the service processes PDF or image files that contain the data in question, your corrections will be incorporated to improve the document recognition.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Documents**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open an incoming document record that contains data received from the OCR service that you want to correct.
3. On the **Incoming Document** page, choose the **Correct OCR Data** action.
4. On the **OCR Data Correction** page, overwrite the data in the editable column for each field that has an incorrect value.
5. To undo corrections that you have made since you opened the **OCR Data Correction** page, choose the **Reset OCR Data** action.
6. To send the corrections to the OCR service, choose the **Send OCR Feedback** action.
7. To save the corrections, close the **OCR Data Correction** page.

The fields on the **Financial Information** FastTab on the **Incoming Document** page are updated with any new values that you entered in step 4.

# Revalue Fixed Assets

Revaluation of fixed assets can consist of appreciations, write-downs, or general value adjustments.

When the value of a fixed asset increases, you post a journal line with appreciation to the depreciation book. The new amount is recorded as appreciation according to the fixed asset posting setup.

When the value of a fixed asset decreases, you post a journal line with a lower amount, a write-down, to the depreciation book. The new amount is recorded as a write-down according to the fixed asset posting setup.

Indexation is used to adjust multiple fixed asset values, for example per general price changes. The **Index Fixed Assets** batch job can be used to change various amounts, such as write-down and appreciation amounts.

## To post appreciation from the fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create an initial journal line and fill in the fields as necessary.
3. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Revaluation**.
4. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for appreciation posting.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   Step 4 only works if you have set up the following: On the **FA Posting Group Card** page for the posting group of the fixed asset, the **Appreciation Account** field contains the general ledger debit account and the **Appreciation Bal. Account** field contains the general ledger account to which you want to post balancing entries for appreciation. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).  
5. Choose the **Post** action.

## To post a write-down from the fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create an initial journal line, and fill in the fields as necessary.
3. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Write-Down**.
4. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for write-down posting.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   Step 4 only works if you have set up the following: On the **FA Posting Group Card** page for the posting group of the fixed asset, the **Write-Down Account** field contains the general ledger credit account and the **Write-Down Expense Account** field contains the general ledger debit account to which you want to post balancing entries for write-downs. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).
5. Choose the **Post** action.

## To perform general revaluation of fixed assets

Indexation is used to adjust multiple fixed asset values, for example per general price changes. The **Index Fixed Assets** batch job can be used to change various amounts, such as write-down and appreciation amounts. The **Allow Indexation** checkbox on the **Depreciation Book** page must be selected.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Index Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

    Revaluation lines are created per your settings in step 2. The lines are created in either the fixed asset journal or the fixed asset G/L journal, depending on your template and batch setup on the **FA Journal Setup** page. For more information, see [Set Up General Fixed Asset Information](fa-how-setup-general.md).
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Select the journal with the fixed assets that you want to revalue, and then choose the **Ledger Entries** action.  
6. Check the created entries, and then choose the **Post** action to post the journal.

    > [!TIP]  
    >   If the index figures are for simulation purposes only, you can create a special depreciation book to store them in. Then these entries will not affect any of the other depreciation books.

## To post other acquisition costs

You post other acquisition cost for a fixed asset from a purchase invoice or from a fixed asset journal in the same way as you post the original acquisition cost. For more information, see [Acquire Fixed Assets](fa-how-acquire.md).  

If depreciation is already calculated for the fixed asset, select the **Depr. Acquisition Cost** checkbox to have the other acquisition cost less the salvage value depreciated in proportion to the amount by which the previously acquired fixed asset is depreciated. This method ensures that the depreciation period isn't changed.  

The depreciation percentage is calculated as:  

*P = (total depreciation x 100) / depreciable basis*

*Depreciation amount = (P/100) x (extra acquisition cost - salvage value)*  

Remember to select the **Depr. until FA Posting Date** checkbox on the invoice, the fixed asset G/L journal, or the fixed asset journal lines to ensure that depreciation is calculated from the last fixed asset posting date to the posting date of the other acquisition cost.

### Example - Posting Other Acquisition Costs

A machine is purchased on August 1, 2000. The acquisition cost is 4,800. The depreciation method is straight-line over four years.

On August 31, 2000, the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run. Depreciation is calculated as:

*book value x number of depreciation days / total number of depreciation days = 4800 x 30 / 1440 = 100*  

On September 15, 2000, an invoice is posted for painting the machine. The invoice amount is 480.

If you selected the **Depr. until FA Posting Date** checkbox on the invoice before posting, the following calculation is made:  

15 days of depreciation (from 09/01/00 to 09/15/00) is calculated as:

*book value x number of depreciation days / remaining number of depreciation days = (4800 - 100) x 15 / 1410 = 50*

If you selected the **Depr. Acquisition Cost** checkbox on the invoice before posting, the following calculation is made:  

*The other acquisition cost is depreciated as ((150 x 100) / 4800) / 100 x 480 = 15*

The depreciable basis is now *5280 = (4800 + 480)*, and the accumulated depreciation is *165 = (100 + 50 + 15)*, corresponding to 45 days of depreciation of the total acquisition cost. This calculation means that the asset is totally depreciated within the estimated lifetime of four years.  

When the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run on 09/30/00, the following calculation is made:  

*Remaining depreciable life is 3 years, 10 months, and 15 days = 1395 days*  

*Book value is (5280 - 165) = 5115*  

*Depreciation amount for September 2000: 5115 x 15 / 1395 = 55.00*  

*Total of depreciation = 165 + 55 = 220*  

If you didn't select the **Depr. until FA Posting Date** checkbox, the asset would lose 15 days of depreciation because the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job run on 09/30/00 would calculate depreciation from 09/15/00 to 09/30/00. This means that when the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run on 09/30/00, the calculation is as follows:  

*Remaining life time is 3 years, 10 months, and 15 days = 1395 days*  

*Book value is (4800 + 480 - 100 - 15) = 5165*

*Depreciation amount for September 2000: 5165 x 15 / 1395 = 55.54*  

*Total of depreciation = 100 + 15 + 55.54 = 170.54*

# Understanding WIP methods in project management

As a project progresses, materials, resources, and other expenses are consumed and must be posted to the project. Work in Process (WIP) is a feature that enables you to estimate the financial value of projects in the general ledger while the projects are ongoing. In many cases, you might post expenses for a project before invoicing a project. When only expenses are posted, your financial statement is inaccurate.

To track the value in the general ledger, you can calculate WIP and post the value to the general ledger. For more information, see [Monitor Project Progress and Performance](projects-how-monitor-progress-performance.md).

Out of the box, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the following methods of calculating and recording the value of work in process.

| WIP Method | Description | Recognized Costs | Recognized Sales |
| --- | ------- |--- | --- |
| Cost Value |Recognizes cost when the customer is invoiced. Recognizes sales based on the invoiced sales. |Cost Value|Contract (Invoice Price)|
| Cost of Sales |Recognizes cost when the customer is invoiced. Recognizes sales based on the invoiced sales.|Cost of Sales|Contract (Invoiced Price)|
| Sales Value |Recognizes costs as they're reported. Recognizes sales proportionally to the reported costs.|Usage (Total Cost)|Sales Value|
| Percentage of Completion |Recognizes costs as they're reported. Recognizes sales proportionally to the reported costs.|Usage (Total Cost)|Percentage of Completion|
| Completed Contract |No sales or costs are part of the WIP calculation. Completed contract doesn't recognize revenue and costs until the project is complete. For example, this option is useful when there's high uncertainty around the estimates of costs and revenue for the project.|At Completion|At Completion|

Exact formulas and general ledger transactions are defined by the selection in the [**Recognized Cost**](#recognized-cost) and [**Recognized Sales**](#recognized-sales) fields.

## Create a project WIP method

Create a project WIP method that meets the needs of your organization and set it as the default.  

> [!NOTE]
> After you use a method to create WIP entries, you can't modify or delete the method.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project WIP Methods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, select the appropriate values for the **Recognized Costs** and **Recognized Sales** fields, and then fill in the other fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Close the page.
4. To make this method the default, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **projects setup**, and then choose the related link.  
5. In the **Default WIP Method** field, choose the method from the list.

### Recognized cost

When project status is changed to Completed, the **Calculate WIP** task reverts the WIP transaction and posts instead.

Dt **Recognized Cost Account** Cr **Project Cost Applied Account** , Amount: **Actual (Total Cost)**

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the selection in the **WIP Posting Method Used** field, the **Item Cost Applied Account**, **Resource Cost Applied Account**, or **G/L Cost Applied Account** could be used instead of **Project Cost Applied Account**. For more information, see [Project posting groups](projects-how-setup-jobs.md#to-set-general-information-for-projects).

# Set Up Put-away Templates

With directed put-away and pick functionality, the most appropriate bin for your items at any given time is suggested, according to the put-away template that you have set up for the warehouse, the bin rankings you have given to the bins, and the minimum and maximum quantities that you have set up for fixed bins.  

You can set up a number of put-away templates and select one of them to govern put-aways in general in your warehouse. You can also select a put-away template for any item or stockkeeping unit that might have special put-away requirements.  

## To set up put-away templates

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Put-away Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Enter a code that is the unique identifier of the template you are about to create.  
4. Enter a short description, if you wish.  
5. Fill in the first line with the bin requirements that you want fulfilled first and foremost when suggesting a put-away.

    For example, if want the default put-away method to be based on fixed bins, then choose the **Find Fixed Bin** field. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
6. Fill in the second line with the bin requirements that would be your second choice to fulfill in finding a bin for put-away. The second line is used only if a bin that meets the requirements of the first line cannot be found.  
7. Continue to fill in the lines until you have described all the acceptable bin placements that you want to use in the put-away process.  
8. On the last line in the put-away template, select the **Find Floating Bin** check box.  

You can create various put-away templates and then apply them as you see fit. The put-away template that you selected for the item or stockkeeping unit, if any is used first. If these fields are not filled in, then the put-away template that you selected for the warehouse on the **Bin Policies** FastTab on the location card is used.

# Assign permissions to users and groups

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-long](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-long.md)]

The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] security system controls which objects a user can access within each database or environment, in combination with the user's license. For each user you can specify whether they're able to read, modify, or enter data in database objects. For more information, see [Data Security](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/data-security?tabs=object-level) in the developer and administration content for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

Before you assign permissions to users and user groups, you must define who can sign in by creating users according to their license. For more information, see [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], there are two levels of permissions to database objects:

- Overall permissions according to the license, also referred to as the entitlement.

  The licenses include default permission sets. Starting in 2022 release wave 1, admins can customize these default permissions for the relevant license types. For more information, see [Configure permissions based on licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md#licensespermissions).  

- Detailed permissions that you assign in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

This article describes how to define, use, and apply permissions in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to change the default configuration.  

[!INCLUDE [admin-gdap-users](includes/admin-gdap-users.md)]  
For more information, see [Delegated administrator access to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/delegated-admin).  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online includes default user groups that are assigned to users automatically based on their license. You can change the default configuration by modifying or adding security groups, permission sets, and permissions. The following table outlines key scenarios for modifying the default permissions.  

|To  |See  |
|---------|---------|
|To make it easier to manage permissions for multiple users, you can organize them in security groups and then assign or change one permission set for many users in one action.| [Manage permissions through user groups](#manage-permissions-through-user-groups) |

> [!NOTE]
> An broader way to define which features users have access to is by setting the **Experience** field on the **Company Information** page. For more information, see [Change Which Features are Displayed](ui-experiences.md).
>
> You can also define the features that are available to users in the user interface and how they interact with them through pages. You do this through profiles that you assign to different types of users according to their job role or department. For more information, see [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md) and [Customizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](ui-customizing-overview.md).

## Create a permission set

> [!NOTE]
> In 2022 release wave 2 we made it easier to add permissions to permission sets. Rather than adding permissions individually, you can add entire permission sets. If needed, you can then exclude individual permissions in them. For more information, see [To add other permission sets](#to-add-other-permission-sets). To make that possible, we replaced the Permission Set page with a new one. The key differences are the new **Permission Sets** and **Results** panes, and the **Included permissions** FactBox. To continue using the replaced Permissions page, on the **Permission Sets** page, choose the **Permissions (legacy)** action.

Maintenance is also easier. When you add a system permission, your user-defined permission set will be automatically updated with any changes that Microsoft makes to those permissions.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Permission Sets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the new line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **Permissions** action.
5. On the **Permission Set** page, in the **Type** field, include or exclude permissions to the object as follows:

  To include the permission, choose **Include**, and then choose level of access to give in the **Read Permission**, **Insert Permission**, **Modify Permission**, **Delete Permission**, and **Execute Permission** fields. The following table describes the options.

  |Option|Description|Ranking|
  |------|-----------|-------|
  |**Blank**|The user can't perform the action on the object.|Lowest|  
  |**Yes**|The user can perform the action on the object.|Highest|
  |**Indirect**|The user can perform the action on the object, but only through another related object that the user has full access to. For more information, see [Example - Indirect Permission](#example---indirect-permission) in this article, and [Permissions Property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-permissions-property#example---indirect-permission) in Developer and IT-Pro Help.|Second highest|
  
  To exclude the permission, or one or more access levels, choose **Exclude**, and then choose the level of access to give. The following table describes the options.

  |Option|Description|
  |------|-----------|-------|
  |**Blank**|Use the access level based on the hierarchy of permissions in the set.  |
  |**Exclude**|Remove the specific access level for the object.|
  |**Reduce to indirect**|Change the access level to Indirect if any permission sets give Direct access to the object. For example, choose this option if the permission set gives Direct access to G/L entries but you don't want users to have full access to the entries.|
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > If a permission is in a permission set that is included, and is also in a permission set that is excluded, the permission will be excluded.

6. Use the **Object Type** and **Object ID** fields to specify the object you're giving access to.

  > [!TIP]
  > New lines show default values. For example, the **Object Type** field contains **Table Data**, and the **Object ID** field contains **0**. The default values are just placeholders, and aren't used. You must choose a type of object and an object in the **Object ID** field before you can create another new line.

7. Optional: If you're defining permissions for a Table Data object type, in the **Security Filter** field you can filter the data that a user can access in fields on the selected table. For example, you might want to let a user access only records that contain information about a particular customer. For more information, see [Security filters limit a user's access to specific records in a table](#security-filters-limit-a-users-access-to-specific-records-in-a-table) and [Using Security Filters](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/security-filters).
8. Optional: On the **Permission Sets** pane, add one or more other permission sets. For more information, see [To add other permission sets](#to-add-other-permission-sets).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use caution when assigning **Insert Permission** or **Modify Permission** to the **9001 User Group Member** or **9003 User Group Permission Set** table. Any users assigned to the permission set could potentially assign themselves to other user groups, which in turn might give them unintended permissions.

### Example - Indirect Permission

You can assign Indirect permission to allow a user to use an object, but only through another object. For example, a user has permission to run codeunit 80, Sales-Post. The Sales-Post codeunit performs many tasks, including modifying table 37, Sales Line. When the user posts a sales document using the Sales-Post codeunit, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks whether the user has permission to modify the Sales Line table. If not, the codeunit can't complete its tasks, and the user receives an error message. If so, the codeunit runs successfully.

However, the user doesn't need to have full access to the Sales Line table to run the codeunit. If the user has Indirect permission for the Sales Line table, the Sales-Post codeunit runs successfully. When a user has Indirect permission, they can only modify the Sales Line table by running the Sales-Post codeunit or another object that has permission to modify the Sales Line table. The user can only modify the Sales Line table when doing so from supported application areas. The user can't run the feature inadvertently or maliciously by other methods.

### To add other permission sets

Expand a permission set by adding other permission sets to it. Afterward, you can include or exclude specific permissions, or entire permission sets, in each set you add. This includes permissions in the Extension and System type permission sets, which otherwise isn't allowed. Exclusions apply only to the permission set you're expanding. The original set isn't affected.

On the **Permission Set** page, add a permission set on the **Permission Sets** pane. The **Result** pane lists all added permission sets. To explore the permissions that are included in a set you've added, choose the set on the Result pane and the **Included permissions** FactBox will show the permissions.

On the **Result** pane, use the **Inclusion Status** field to identify the permission sets in which you've excluded permissions or permission sets. If something's been excluded, the status will be **Partial**.

For an overall view of permissions in the permission set, choose the **View all permissions** action. The **Expanded Permissions** page shows all permissions that were already assigned to the permission set and the permissions in the added permission sets.

To fully exclude all permissions from a permission set, on the **Result** pane, select the line, choose **Show more options**, and then choose **Exclude**. When you exclude a permission set, a line is created on the **Permission Sets** pane of the type Excluded. If you've excluded a permission set, but want to include it again, delete the line on the **Permission Sets** pane.

To fully or partially exclude a specific permission in a set you've added, under **Permissions**, create a line for the object. The access level fields, Insert Permission, Modify Permission, and so on, will all contain **Exclude**. To allow a certain access level, choose the appropriate option.

Excluding a permission set excludes all of the permissions in the set. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates permissions as follows:

1. Calculate the full list of included permissions
2. Calculate the full list of excluded permissions
3. Remove excluded permissions from the list of included permissions (removing an indirect permission is the same as Reduce to Indirect)

## Copy a permission set

Create a new permission set by copying another. The new set will include all of the permissions and permission sets from the set you copied. How the permissions and permission sets are arranged in the new permission set differs, depending on your choice in the **Copy operation** field. The following table describes the options.

|Option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Copy by reference**     | The original permission set and all of the permission sets that were added to it are listed on the **Results** pane.       |
|**Flat permission copy**  | All permissions from all permission sets are included in a flat list on the **Permissions pane**. Permissions are not organized by permission set.        |
|**Clone**     | Create an exact copy of the original permission set.        |

1. On the **Permission Sets** page, select the line for a permission set that you want to copy, and then choose the **Copy Permission Set** action.
2. On the **Copy Permission Set** page, specify the name of the new permission set.
3. In the **Copy operation** field, specify how to arrange permission in the new permission set.
4. Optional: If you're adding a System permission set, you might want to be notified if the name or content of the original permission set changes in a future version. This lets you consider whether to update your user-defined permission set. To receive a notification, turn on the **Notify on Changed Permission Set** toggle.

> [!NOTE]
> The notification requires that the **Original System permission set changed** notification is enabled on the **My Notifications** page.

## Create or modify permissions by recording your actions

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Permission Sets**, and then choose the related link.

    Alternatively, on the **Users** page, choose the **Permission Sets** action.
2. On the **Permission Sets** page, choose the **New** Action.
3. On a new line, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **Permissions** action.
5. On the **Permissions** page, choose the **Record Permissions** action, and then choose the **Start** action.  
    Recording must be done either by using the **Open this page in a new windows** (pop-out) feature to have the **Permissions** recording window side-by-side, or by working within the same tab.  
    A recording process now starts and captures all of your actions in the user interface.
6. Go to the various pages and activities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that you want users with this permission set to access. You must carry out the tasks that you want to record permissions for.
7. When you want to finish the recording, return to the **Permissions** page, and then choose the **Stop** action.
8. Choose the **Yes** button to add the recorded permissions to the new permission set.
9. For each object in the recorded list, specify whether users are able to insert, modify, or delete records in the recorded tables.

### To export and import a permission set

To quickly set up permissions, you can import permission sets that you exported from another [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant.

In multi-tenant environments, a permission set will be imported into a specific tenant. In other words, the scope of the import is *Tenant*.

1. In tenant 1, on the **Permission Sets** page, select the line or lines for the permission sets to export, and then choose the **Export Permission Sets** action.

    An XML file is created in the download folder on your machine. By default, the name is *Export Permission Sets.xml*.

2. In tenant 2, on the **Permission Sets** page, select the **Import Permission Sets** action.
3. On the **Import Permission Sets** dialog page, consider if you want to merge existing permission sets with any new permission sets in the XML file.

    If you select the **Update existing permissions** checkbox, existing permission sets that match names in the XML file will be merged with the imported permission sets.

    If you don't select the **Update existing permissions** checkbox, permission sets that match names in the XML file will be skipped during import. In that case, you'll be notified about permission sets that are skipped.

4. From the **Import** dialog page, find and select the XML file to be imported, and then choose the **Open** action.

The permission sets are imported.

## Remove obsolete permissions from all permission sets

On the **Permission Sets** page, choose the **Remove Obsolete Permissions** action.

## Set up time constraints for users

Administrators can define periods of time during which specified users are able to post. Administrators can also specify if the system logs how much time users are signed in. Similarly, administrators can assign responsibility centers to users. For more information, see [Work with Responsibility Centers](inventory-responsibility-centers.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **User Setup** page opens, choose the **New** action.
3. In the **User ID** field, enter the ID of a user, or choose the field to see all current Windows users in the system.
4. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## Control access to specific companies

When you have multiple companies in Business Central, managing permissions across companies requires extra consideration. You might not want users to have identical access rights to all companies. Instead, you may need to grant users' permissions based on their company affiliations. To support this scenario, when you assign permission sets to individual users or security groups, you have the option to select a specific company to which the permission set applies. The company isn't explicitly specified within the permission set, but rather when the permission set is assigned to the user or security group.

If you don't specify the company when assigning a permission set, the permission set then applies to all companies. If you want a permission set to apply to more than one company, but not all companies, add the permission set specifically for each company separately.

Learn how at [Assign permission sets to users](#assign-permission-sets-to-users) or [Assign permissions to a security group](ui-security-groups.md#assign-permissions-to-a-security-group).

## Manage permissions through user groups

User groups help you manage permission sets across the company. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online includes default user groups that are assigned to users automatically based on their license. You can add users manually to a user group, and you can create new user groups as copies of existing ones.  

You start by creating a user group. Then you assign permission sets to the group to define which object users of the group can access. When you add user to the group, the permission sets defined for the group will apply to the user.

Permission sets assigned to a user through a user group stay synchronized. A change to the user group permissions is automatically propagated to the users. If you remove a user from a user group, the involved permissions are automatically revoked.

### To add users to a user group

The following procedure explains how to create user groups manually. To create user groups automatically, see [To copy a user group and all its permission sets](#to-copy-a-user-group-and-all-its-permission-sets).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Groups**, and then choose the related link.

    1. Alternatively, on the **Users** page, choose the **User Groups** action.
2. On the **User Group** page, choose the **User Group Members** action.
3. On the **User Group Members** page, choose the **Add Users** action.

### To copy a user group and all its permission sets

To quickly define a new user group, you can copy all permission sets from an existing user group to your new user group.

> [!NOTE]
> The user group members are not copied to the new user group. You must add them manually afterwards. For more information, see the [To add users to a user group](#to-add-users-to-a-user-group) section.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the user group that you want to copy, and then choose the **Copy User Group** action.
3. In the **New User Group Code** field, enter a name for the group, and then choose the **OK** button.

The new user group is added to the **User Groups** page. Proceed to add users. For more information, see the [To add users to a user group](#to-add-users-to-a-user-group) section.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You'll get a validation error if you're trying to assign a user group to the user that refers to a permission set which was defined in an uninstalled extension. It's because the App ID of the extension is validated whenever it's referenced. To assign that user group to a user, you can either re-install the extension, remove the reference of the uninstalled extension from the permission set, or remove that permission set from the user group.

### To assign permission sets to user groups

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the user group that you want to assign permission to.  

    Any permission sets that are already assigned to the user are displayed in the **Permission Sets** FactBox.
3. Choose the **User Permission Sets** action to open the **User Permission Sets** page.
4. On the **User Permission Sets** page, on a new line, fill in the fields as necessary.

### To assign a permission set on the Permission Set by User Group page

The following procedure explains how to assign permission sets to a user group on the **Permission Set by User Group** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Users** page, select the relevant user, and then choose the **Permission Set by User Group** action.
3. On the **Permission Set by User Group** page, select the **[user group name]** field on a line for the relevant permission set to assign the set to the user group.
4. Select the **All User Groups** checkbox to assign the permission set to all user groups.

You can also assign permissions sets directly to a user.

## Assign permission sets to users

A permission set is a collection of permissions for specific database objects. All users must be assigned one or more permission sets before they can access [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

A [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] solution contains predefined permission sets that are added by Microsoft or by your solution provider. You can also add new permission sets tailored to meet the needs of your organization. For more information, see the [Create a permission set](#create-a-permission-set) section.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not want to restrict a user's access more than already defined by the license, you can assign a special permission set called SUPER to the user. This permission set ensures that the user can access all objects specified in the license.
>
> A user with the Essential license and the SUPER permission set has access to more functionality than users with the Team Member license and the SUPER permission set.

You can assign permissions sets to users in two ways:

- From the **User Card** page by selecting permission sets to assign to the user.
- From the **Permission Set by User** page by selecting users that a permission set is assigned to.

### To assign a permission set on a user card

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
1. Select the user that you want to assign permission to.

   Any permission sets that are already assigned to the user are displayed in the **Permission Sets** FactBox.
1. Choose the **Edit** action to open the **User Card** page.
1. On the **User Permission Sets** FastTab, on a new line, fill in the fields as necessary. For more information, see [Create or edit a permission set](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#create-a-permission-set).

   If you want the permission set to apply to a specific company, set the **Company** field to that company. If you want the permission set to apply to all companies, leave the **Company** field blank. [Learn more](#control-access-to-specific-companies).

## To assign a permission set on the Permission Set by User page

This method makes it easier for you to assign different permission sets to multiple users. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
1. On the **Users** page, choose the **Permission Set by User** action.
1. If you want the permission sets to apply only to a specific company, set the **Company name** field to that company. If you want the permission set to apply to all companies, leave the **Company name** field blank. [Learn more](#control-access-to-specific-companies).
1. On the **Permission Set by User** page, select the **[user name]** checkbox on a line for the relevant permission set to assign the set to the user.

    Select the **All Users** checkbox to assign the permission set to all users.

## Get an overview of a user's permissions

You can view other users' effective permissions only if you're assigned to the SECURITY or SUPER permissions. 

The **Effective Permissions** page offers additional information about the source of each permission. For example, whether the source is a security group, or a permission is inherited. The page also contains a column where administrators can review the security filters that are applied. To learn more about security filters, go to [Security filters limit a user's access to specific records in a table](#security-filters-limit-a-users-access-to-specific-records-in-a-table).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of the relevant user.
3. Choose the **Effective Permissions** action.

    The **Permissions** part lists all the database objects that the user has access to. You can't edit this section.

    The **By Permission Set** part shows the assigned permission sets through which the permissions are granted to the user, the source and type of the permission set, and to which extent the different access types are permitted.

    For each row that you select in the **Permissions** section, the **By Permission Set** section shows which permission set or sets that the permission is granted through. In this section, you can edit the value in each of the five access type fields, **Read Permission**, **Insert Permission**, **Modify Permission**, **Delete Permission**, **Execute Permission**.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Only permission sets of type **User-Defined** can be edited.
    >
    > Rows of source Entitlement originate from the subscription license. The permission values of the entitlement overrule values in other permission sets if they have a higher ranking. A value in a non-entitlement permission set that has a higher ranking than the related value in the entitlement will be surrounded by brackets to indicate that it is not effective as it is overruled by the entitlement.
    >
    > For an explanation of ranking, see [Create a permission set](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#create-a-permission-set).  

4. To edit a permission set, in the **By Permission Set** part, on the line for a relevant permission set of type **User-Defined**, choose one of the five access type fields and select a different value.

5. To edit individual permissions within the permission set, choose the value in the **Permission Set** field to open the **Permissions** page.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you edit a permission set, the changes will also apply to other users that have the permission set assigned.

### Security filters limit a user's access to specific records in a table

For record-level security in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], use security filters to limit a user's access to data in a table. You create security filters on table data. A security filter describes a set of records in a table that a user has permission to access. You can specify, for example, that a user can only read the records that contain information about a particular customer. In this way, the user can't access the records that contain information about other customers. For more information, see [Using Security Filters](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/security-filters) in the administration content.


## View permission changes telemetry

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to send changes that are done to permission to an Application Insights resource in Microsoft Azure. Then, using Azure Monitor, you create reports and set up alerts on the gathered data. For more information, see the following articles in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Developer and admin help:

- [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry - Enabling Application Insights](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview#enable)

# Handling missing option values

This article is intended for a technical audience. The processes it describes require the help of a developer.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contains three option set fields that contain values that you can map to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fields of the Option type for automated synchronization. During synchronization, nonmapped options are ignored and the missing options are appended to the related [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and added to the **Dataverse Option Mapping** system table to handle manually later. For example, by adding the missing options in either product and then updating the mapping.

The **Integration Table Mapping** page contains three fields that contain one or more mapped option values. After a full synchronization, the **Dataverse Option Mapping** page contains the nonmapped options in the three fields.

|         Record             | Option Value | Option Value Caption |
|----------------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Payment Terms: NET30	     | 1            | Net 30	           |
| Payment Terms: 2%10NET30   | 2            | 2% 10; Net 30        |
| Payment Terms: NET45	     | 3            | Net 45               |
| Payment Terms: NET60	     | 4            | Net 60               |
| Shipment Method: FOB	     | 1            | FOB                  |
| Shipment Method: NOCHARGE  | 2            | No Charge            |
| Shipping Agent: AIRBORNE   | 1            | Airborne             |
| Shipping Agent: DHL        | 2            | DHL                  |
| Shipping Agent: FEDEX      | 3            | FedEx                |
| Shipping Agent: UPS        | 4            | UPS                  |
| Shipping Agent: POSTALMAIL | 5            | Postal Mail          |
| Shipping Agent: FULLLOAD   | 6            | Full Load            |
| Shipping Agent: WILLCALL   | 7            | Will Call            |

The content of the **Dataverse Option Mapping** page is based on enum values in the **CRM Account** table. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], the following fields on the account table are mapped to fields on the customer and vendor records:

- **Address 1: Freight Terms** of data type Enum, where values are defined as follows:

```
enum 5335 "CDS Shipment Method Code"
{
    Extensible = true;
    value(0; " ") { Caption = ' '; }
    value(1; "FOB") { Caption = 'FOB'; }
    value(2; "NoCharge") { Caption = 'No Charge'; }
}
```

- **Address 1: Shipping Method** of data type Enum, where values are defined as follows:

```
enum 5336 "CDS Shipping Agent Code"
{
    Extensible = true;
    value(0; " ") { Caption = ' '; }
    value(1; "Airborne") { Caption = 'Airborne'; }
    value(2; "DHL") { Caption = 'DHL'; }
    value(3; "FedEx") { Caption = 'FedEx'; }
    value(4; "UPS") { Caption = 'UPS'; }
    value(5; "PostalMail") { Caption = 'Postal Mail'; }
    value(6; "FullLoad") { Caption = 'Full Load'; }
    value(7; "WillCall") { Caption = 'Will Call'; }
}
```

- **Payment Terms** of data type Enum, where values are defined as follows:

```
enum 5334 "CDS Payment Terms Code"
{
    Extensible = true;
    value(0; " ") { Caption = ' '; }
    value(1; "Net30") { Caption = 'Net 30'; }
    value(2; "2%10Net30") { Caption = '2% 10; Net 30'; }
    value(3; "Net45") { Caption = 'Net 45'; }
    value(4; "Net60") { Caption = 'Net 60'; }
}
```

All of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] enums are mapped to option sets in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

## Extending option sets in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]
1. Create a new AL extension.

2. Add an Enum extension for the options that you want to extend. Be sure that you use the same value. 

```
enumextension 50100 "CDS Payment Terms Code Extension" extends "CDS Payment Terms Code"
{
    value(779800001; "Cash Payment") { Caption = 'Cash Payment'; }
    value(779800002; "Transfer") { Caption = 'Transfer'; }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You must use the same option ID values from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] when you extend the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] enum. Otherwise synchronization will fail.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Do not use the ","  character in the enum values and captions. This is currently not supported by the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> The first ten characters of the new option value names and captions must be unique. For example, two options named "Transfer 20 working days" and "Transfer 20 calendar days" will cause an error because both have the same first 10 characters, "Transfer 2". Name them, for example, "TRF20 WD" and "TRF20 CD."

## Update [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] option mapping
Now you can recreate the mapping between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] options and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records.

On the **Integration Table Mapping** page, choose the line for the **Payment Terms** map, and then choose the **Synchronize Modified Records** action. The **Dataverse Option Mapping** page is updated with the following records.

|         Record                 | Option Value   | Option Value Caption |
|--------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|

# The Basic Experience extension

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

If you have been using Microsoft Dynamics C5, Microsoft partners can help you transition to a more modern solution that is based on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], so you can continue to enjoy the same streamlined capabilities as Dynamics C5.

This extension is intended for small businesses and can support up to three users. If you need more users, you must upgrade to a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license and uninstall this extension.

> [!NOTE]
> As of now, this extension is available only to customers in Denmark and Iceland.

## What's available

The following table describes the capabilities that are available if you install the Basic Experience extension.

|Area  |Functionality  |
|---------|---------|
|**General Ledger** |Basic finance, financial reports, fixed assets, bank management, bank reconciliation, payments, direct debit, dimensions, multiple currencies, budgets, workflow, document management/OCR, consolidation, unlimited companies|
|**Accounts Receivable/Sales** |Basic receivables, sales invoicing, sales discounts, pricing, sales tax, contact management |
|**Accounts Payable/Purchase** |Basic payables, purchase invoicing |
|**Project Management** |Jobs, job pricing, time sheets, assignments, tasks, resources |
|**Inventory** |Basic inventory, item substitutions, item cross reference |

## Getting started

This extension is a bit different than most, and you'll need help from a Microsoft partner to install and set it up. So that you know what to expect, here's a high-level view of what the Microsoft partner does.

1. Create a new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant. This can be either a trial or a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) version.
2. Add at least one user who is assigned to a Basic Experience license in your Microsoft Entra account.
3. Remove all companies, including the sample Cronus company.
4. Create a new company that doesn't contain any sample data or setups.
5. Add the **Demo RapidStart** package. <!--what does the package contain?-->
6. Download and install the Basic Experience extension from AppSource.

## Migrating data

Bring your Dynamics C5 data along. After your Microsoft partner installs the Basic Experience extension, you'll have an empty company. An easy way to move your data from Dynamics C5 to Basic Experience is to use the C5 Data Migration extension, which is included in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The extension migrates customers, vendors, items, and your general ledger accounts and their entries.

# Reverse Output Posting

There are times when output posting must be reversed. An example of this would be if a data entry error occurred and an incorrect amount of output is posted to a production order.  

## To reverse an output posting

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Output Journal**, and then choose the related link. Select your batch.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. For more information, see [Batch Post Output and Run Times](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md).
3. In the **Applies-To Entry** field, select the associated item ledger entry. This reverses the capacity and item ledger entries.  
4. Post the reversal by posting the journal.  

The output journal entries are posted to the item ledger as a positive adjustment.

# Acquire fixed assets

Use the **Fixed Asset Card** page to enter information about an asset. You can set up buildings or production equipment as a main asset with a component list, and you can group them in various ways, such as by class, department, or location. You must set up and assign a depreciation book to each fixed asset before you can acquire it.

After you set up a fixed asset and assign a depreciation book, you must acquire the fixed asset. To acquire a fixed asset, you record its acquisition cost in the relevant G/L account, bank account, or vendor by posting an acquisition transaction from the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page. You can use the **Assisted Fixed Asset Acquisition** page to create and post the required general journal lines automatically.

Use indexation to adjust values for general price-level changes. Use the **Index Fixed Assets** batch job to calculate the acquisition costs and replacement costs.

## Add a fixed asset to your list of fixed assets

Before you can acquire a fixed asset, you must add it to your list of assets. There are several ways to add fixed assets to your list:

* Enter information about the assets on the **Fixed Asset Card** page.
* Use the **Edit in Excel** action to download your list of assets to a worksheet, add new assets to the list, and then publish the update to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Use a purchase order to add assets.
* Use the **Copy fixed asset** action.

After you add fixed assets to your list, the next step is to acquire them so you can use them in transactions. Learn more at [Acquire a fixed asset](#acquire-fixed-assets).

### Add a fixed asset on the Fixed Asset Card page

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. On the **Depreciation Book** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. This step assigns a depreciation book to the fixed asset.  
4. If you need to assign more than one depreciation book to the fixed asset, choose the **Add More Depreciation Books** action. To learn more, go to [To assign a depreciation book to a fixed asset](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md#to-assign-a-depreciation-book-to-a-fixed-asset).

    After you fill in the required fields, the **You are ready to acquire the fixed asset.** notification appears at the top of the page. If you're ready to acquire the asset now, choose the **Acquire** action. Follow the steps on the **Assisted Fixed Asset Acquisition** page to complete the acquisition. If you aren't ready, you can always acquire the asset later.

### Use Edit in Excel to add assets

If you want to add numerous fixed assets, Edit in Excel is a great tool to use. The tool downloads your current list of assets in a worksheet that includes most of the fields available on the Fixed Asset Card page. You can fill in some or all of fields on a row for each asset, and publish your changes to add them to your list in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you can't fill in all required field, that's ok. You can update them in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when you're ready.

> [!NOTE]
> To use the Edit in Excel action, you must have the Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in installed. The add-in creates the connection between Excel and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Get the Business Central Add-in for Excel](admin-deploy-excel-addin.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the :::image type="content" source="media/share-icon.png" alt-text="Share this page with other users or apps icon."::: icon, and then choose **Edit in Excel**.
3. Open the downloaded file, and enter information about the new fixed assets.

   > [!TIP]
   > You don't need to enter an identifier in the **No.** column. When you publish your update, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns an identifier based on the number series you use for fixed assets.

4. To update [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Microsoft Dynamics** pane, choose **Publish**.

### Add a fixed asset from a purchase order or invoice

The following steps describe how to add a fixed asset from a purchase order. The steps are similar for a purchase invoice.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **New** to create a new purchase order.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, choose **Fixed Asset**.
5. In the **No.** field, either choose an existing fixed asset to add an expense, or choose **New** to add a new asset.
6. After you enter the information for the new asset and the purchase order, choose **Post**.

## Acquire a fixed asset by using a fixed asset G/L journal

The following procedure describes how to acquire by creating and posting the required fixed asset G/L journal lines. You can also create and post the journal lines manually. To learn more, go to [Acquire a fixed asset by using a fixed asset G/L journal](#acquire-a-fixed-asset-by-using-a-fixed-asset-gl-journal).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the asset you want to acquire, and then choose the **Acquire** action.
1. Follow the steps on the **Assisted Fixed Asset Acquisition** page to complete the acquisition.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also post acquisition cost as credits. In that case, remember that the value in the **Acquisition Cost Incl. VAT** field must be with a minus sign to indicate a credit.

When you choose **Finish**, the **Book Value** field on the **Fixed Asset Card** page is filled in, which indicates that the fixed asset was acquired at the specified acquisition cost.  

## To post a fixed asset acquisition manually with a fixed asset G/L journal

The following procedure describes how to acquire a fixed asset manually by creating and posting lines on the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page. You can also acquire a fixed asset automatically on the **Fixed Asset Card** page by choosing the **Acquire fixed asset** action. To learn more, go to [Acquire a fixed asset](#acquire-fixed-assets).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also post acquisition cost as credits. In that case, remember that the value in the **Amount** field must be with a minus sign to indicate a credit.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page, in the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Acquisition Cost**.
3. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **Post** action.  

> [!TIP]  
> If you fill in the **Insurance No.** field, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also posts the acquisition cost of the fixed asset to the insurance coverage ledger. To learn more, go to [Insure Fixed Assets](fa-how-insure.md).

## To set up a component list for a main asset

You can group your fixed assets into main assets and their components. For example, you might have a production machine that consists of several parts that you want to group in this manner.  

You must set up the main asset and all its components as individual fixed asset. After you set up a component list, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically fills in the **Main Assets/Component** and **Components of Main Asset** fields on the fixed assets.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the fixed asset that is the main asset, and then choose the **Main Asset Components** action.
3. On the **Main Asset Components** page, choose the **FA No**. field, and then select the fixed asset that you want to add as a component of the main asset.
4. Close the page.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each component asset that you want to add.
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Setup**, and then choose the related link.
7. Turn on the **Allow Posting to Main Assets** toggle.

## To cancel an acquisition cost posting for one fixed asset

If you make an error when posting an acquisition cost, you can remove the entry with the **Cancel FA Entries** batch job and then post the correct acquisition entry. The erroneous entries are transferred to the **FA Error Ledger Entries** page.

For example, if you post an acquisition with the wrong date, you must correct it as soon as possible because the fixed asset posting date is used for many calculations.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can't use the **Reverse Transactions** action for fixed asset entries.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Ledger Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **FA Ledger Entries** page, select the entry or entries that you want to cancel.  
3. Choose the **Actions** menu, and then choose the **Cancel Entries** action.
4. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. Choose the **OK** button to run the batch job.
6. When the incorrect entry or entries are canceled, proceed to post the correct acquisition cost.

## To post the salvage value together with the acquisition cost

The salvage value is the residual value of a fixed asset when it can no longer be used. You can post the salvage value at the same time as you post the acquisition cost. To learn more, go to [Depreciate or Amortize Fixed Assets](fa-how-depreciate-amortize.md).

You can post the salvage value together with the acquisition cost from a fixed asset journal.

> [!NOTE]
> This process might require that you personalize the Fixed Asset Journals page by adding the Salvage Value field. By default, the field is not displayed on the page. To learn more, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Fixed Asset Journals** page, create the acquisition line. To learn more, go to [To post a fixed asset acquisition manually with a fixed asset G/L journal](#to-post-a-fixed-asset-acquisition-manually-with-a-fixed-asset-gl-journal).
3. In the **Salvage Value** field on the journal line, enter the salvage value amount as a credit (prefix the amount with a minus sign, for example, **-**100).
4. Choose the **Post** action.

> [!NOTE]
> If a salvage value exists for a fixed asset, that value is used in depreciation posting instead of the value in the **Ending Book Value** field on the **FA Depreciation Books** page. To learn more, go to [To manage the ending book value](fa-how-depreciate-amortize.md#to-manage-the-ending-book-value).

# Manage product variants

Item variants are a great way to keep your list of products under control. For example, you have a large number of items that are almost identical and vary only in color. You can define each variant as a separate item. But you can also choose to set up one item and specify the various colors as variants of the item.  

> [!TIP]
> For a practical introduction to using variants in production, see [Walkthrough: Variants](contoso-coffee/manufacturing/variants.md) for the Contoso Coffee demo data.  

## Add variants to an item

It's easy enough to define variants for an item.  

### To add variants

1. Open [the **Items List** page](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=31), open the relevant item.  
2. On the **Item** card, choose the **Related** action, then choose **Item**, and then choose the **Variants** action.  
3. On the **Item Variants** page, list the variants.  

Then, when you create a sales document and add the item, you can specify the variant of the item in the Variant **Code** field. The same applies to purchasing documents.  

## Item availability by variant

[!INCLUDE [inventory_variant-availability](includes/inventory_variant-availability.md)]

## Require use of variants

Starting in 2022 release wave 2, admins can require that users specify the variant in documents and journals for items that have variants. To activate the capability, on the **Inventory Setup** page, and select the **Variant Mandatory if Exists** field. You can override this global setting for specific items.  

On item cards, the **Variant Mandatory if Exists** field has the following options:

|Field value |Description|
|---------|----|
|Default (No)| The setting from **Inventory Setup** applies to this item.|
|No| Users aren't required to specify a variant for this item.|
|Yes| If the item has one or more variants, users must specify the relevant variant. If they don't, they're blocked from posting the transaction.|

> [!NOTE]
> These settings don't affect items that don't have variants.

If the capability is switched on, you can't post an entry if the variant isn't specified.

# Moving Average (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Moving Average** report gives a clear picture of your organization's average sales over a 30 day period. Use the report to identify key trends over a set period of time. This report focuses on the sales amount and comparing the current sales amount value against a 30 day average.

## Use the report

The **Moving Average** report is meant to help higher level employees identify key trends and make changes based on average sales.

Sales executives need to track the moving average of key sales metrics over a specific period. You can use this report to find recent performance trends and make strategic decisions for the short-term future.

Leaders of sales departments typically want to identify which items are selling well and which aren't. This information helps you make informed decisions about your inventory management and future marketing strategies.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)
- [**Sales Amount Average 30D**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-avg-30d-fiscal)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Value Entry
- Sales Line

# Manage user settings and preferences

As an administrator, you can configure user settings in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], similar to how individual users can manage their own preferences in the **My Settings** page.  

Get an overview of all users in the **Users** list, and change individual settings by selecting the **User Settings** action for the relevant user.

> [!TIP]
> The **User Settings** list shows the current settings for each user. To view or edit individual users, select the **View** or **Edit** action.

The **User Settings** card page is similar to the **My Settings** page that each user has access to, and it's a powerful tool for you as the administrator for setting default settings and clearing personalized pages, for example.  

## Types of user settings

*User settings* isn't the same as *user setup*, which is about the user as an entity and the user's access in the system. Furthermore, the user settings have nothing to do with a user's personalization, such as lightweight changes to the user interface. User settings determine the predefined settings for each user in various aspects of the way the application presents itself to the user. The following paragraph lists the five types of user settings and preferences that can be set by the individual or centrally by the administrator:

* **Company**  

  This setting determines the company to be logged into at the next sign-in. A user can have access to multiple companies and can be active in several companies.

* **Role**  

  The role, or profile, describes the user's function in the company, such as *Sales Manager*, *Bookkeeper*, or *Purchasing Agent*. The profile then determines the user's role center, the home page that users experience when they sign in. The profile doesn't impact access rights to functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

* **Language**  

  Defines the application language that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] presents text, captions, and error messages in. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users are synchronized from Microsoft 365, the language settings from Microsoft 365 are used, assuming that the user wants to use the same settings in Office products and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The administrator can change the default setting, and each user can choose between available languages in the My Settings page. But they'll be reset to the value from Microsoft 365 once the next synchronization is performed.

  If the language setting from Microsoft 365 matches a supported language in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], this language is chosen for the user.  

  > [!NOTE]
  > You may have to install a language app for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to properly display the language. Therefore, it's a good practice to install the necessary language apps before any user logs in the first time so that they have a good experience from their first day. For more information, see the list of [supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations).  
  
* **Region**  

  Defines how dates and numbers are presented in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client, such as whether to use European or American date formats, or how to display the decimal sign and thousand separators in amounts. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users are synchronized from Microsoft 365, the regional settings from Microsoft 365 are used, assuming that the user wants to use the same settings in Office products and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. An administrator or user can change these settings manually in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], but they'll be reset to the value from Microsoft 365 once the next synchronization is performed.

* **Time zone**  

  Defines the time zone in which the user is located. Currently this setting isn't synchronized from Microsoft 365 and must be set manually.  

* **Teaching tips**

  [!INCLUDE [ua-teachingtips](includes/ua-teachingtips.md)] As an administrator, you can switch off teaching tips for all users, such as if you are in process of onboarding users who are already familiar with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

> [!NOTE]
> If a Microsoft 365 user synchronization is made while users are logged into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], these users must refresh the browser or sign out and back in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to see a potential different language set by the synchronization action.

## Overview of all user-specific changes

As the administrator, you can get an overview of individual changes to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that each user might have made to various pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. As users make changes to their experience in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], these changes are reflected in the **Personalized Pages** list. <!--Administrators can also set these settings for users before they log in the first time, so users do not have to do it themselves, providing them a better *getting started* experience.-->

<!-- >[!NOTE]
> User personalizations do not have anything to do with the *personal* lightweight changes a user can make to the user experience.-->

## Review or delete user personalizations

1. Select the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Personalized Pages**, and then select the related link.
2. This shows the list of users and their personalized pages. To clear a user's personalization, click the relevant row, or select **Manage**, and then select **Delete**.

This task deletes the personalization, and the user's experience of the relevant page returns to the default state.

# Changing from a QuickBooks app to Dynamics 365 Business Central

More growing businesses are changing from finance apps like QuickBooks Desktop and QuickBooks Online, which are designed for startups and other small businesses, to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], which also supports larger, more complex organizations. 

As they transition, companies typically want to bring their business data with them so they don't start from scratch. To help transfer data, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers built-in extensions that migrate data such as customers, vendors, inventory items, and general ledger accounts. The following extensions are installed and ready to go as an integrated part of the **Data Migration** assisted setup guide:

* QuickBooks Data Migration 
* QuickBooks Online Data Migration

For more information, read about the extension that suits your QuickBooks app:   

* [The QuickBooks Desktop Data Migration Extension](ui-extensions-quickbooks-data-migration.md)
* [The QuickBooks Online Data Migration Extension](ui-extensions-quickbooks-online-data-migration.md)

## Ready now?

If you're ready to get started now, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link. Choose **Migrate business data**, and then follow the steps in the guide.

# Combine receipts on a single invoice

If you want to invoice more than one purchase receipt at a time, you can select multiple receipt lines on the purchase invoice.  

Before you can create a combined purchase receipt, more than one receipt from the same vendor in the same currency must be posted. In other words, you must have filled in two or more purchase orders and posted them as received, but not invoiced.  

When purchase receipts are combined on an invoice and posted, then a posted purchase invoice is created for the invoiced lines. The **Quantity Invoiced** field on the originating purchase order, or blanket purchase order, is updated based on the invoiced quantity. However, this original purchase document isn't deleted, even if it has been fully received and invoiced, and you must therefore delete the purchase document.  

> [!NOTE]
> The resulting purchase invoice cannot later be corrected or canceled. If you want to modify a purchase invoice that is created in this way, you must use purchase credit memos. For more information, see [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-correct-cancel-unpaid-purchase-invoices.md).

## To combine receipts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Get Receipt Lines** action.  
4. Select multiple receipt lines that you want to include in the invoice.  

    If an incorrect receipt line was selected or you want to start over, you can just delete the lines on the purchase invoice and then use the **Get Receipt Lines** function again.  
5. To post the invoice, choose the **Post** action.  

## To remove open purchase orders after combined receipt posting

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Purchase Orders**, and select the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

Alternatively, delete the individual orders manually.

Repeat steps 1 through 3 for any other affected documents, such as blanket purchase orders.

# Set up invoice rounding

If you need to round invoice amounts when you create invoices, you can use the automatic rounding function. When an invoice is rounded, an extra line is added with the rounding amount and posted with the other invoice lines.

> [!NOTE]  
> Local regulations or local custom might require that you to round invoice amounts in a specific way. For example, to an amount divisible by 0.05.  

To use automatic invoice rounding, you must:  

* Specify the general ledger accounts to which rounding differences are posted.  
* Set up rules for rounding invoices in local currency and in foreign currency.  
* Activate the function.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  In addition to the invoice rounding features, you can round amounts on invoices by the unit-amount rounding feature and the amount rounding feature.  

## Set up general ledger accounts for invoice rounding differences

To use automatic invoice rounding, you must set up the general ledger account or accounts where rounding differences are posted. Before you can do so, you must set up VAT product posting groups. For more information, see [Set up VAT](finance-setup-vat.md).  

### To set up general ledger accounts for invoice rounding differences  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, set up the account and name it **Invoice Rounding** or something similar. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the account name as text for invoices that are rounded.  
3. Depending on whether you use VAT or sales tax, in the **Tax Prod. Posting Group** or **VAT Prod. Posting Group** fields, choose a posting group for rounded amounts. You might want to set up a new group code to use for invoice rounding.
4. Leave the **Gen. Posting Type**, and either the **Tax Bus. Posting Group** or **VAT Bus. Posting Group** fields blank. <!-- Why do we say to leave these blank, when there are a lot of other fields we also leave blank but don't mention? -->  

Now you can assign the invoice rounding account to posting groups on the **Vendor Posting Groups** page.  <!-- Why only the vendor posting groups? -->

## Set up rounding for foreign and local currencies
Before you can use the automatic invoice rounding function, you must set up rounding rules for foreign and local currencies.

### To set up rounding for foreign currencies  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Currencies**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Currencies** page, choose the foreign currency to open the **Currency Card**, and then fill in the **Amount Rounding Precision**, **Unit-Amount Rounding Precision**, **Invoice Rounding Precision** and **Invoice Rounding Type** fields.

### To set up rounding for your local currency
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, on the **General** FastTab, fill in the **Inv. Rounding Precision** and **Inv. Rounding Type** fields.  

## Activate the invoice rounding function  
To ensure that sales and purchase invoices are rounded automatically, you must activate the invoice rounding function. You activate invoice rounding separately for sales and purchase invoices.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup** or **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, choose the **Invoice Rounding** check box.

# Set up or change the Chart of Accounts

The chart of accounts (COA) shows the ledger accounts that store your financial data. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a standard COA that is ready to support your business. You can, however, change the default accounts, and you can add new accounts.
<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=944c65b0-9b0f-4d35-b330-de2fad57143a]

## Add or change accounts

From the COA, you can open each general ledger (G/L) account and add or change settings. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] 

If necessary, you can use more than one line for a general ledger account name. On the **G/L Account Card** page, in the **Account** group, choose **Extended Texts**, and then fill in one or more lines with the account name and copied text.  

For accounts of the **Total** account type, you must fill in the **Totaling** field. For **End-Total** accounts, this field is filled in automatically by the Indent function. After you set up the accounts, choose the **Process** action, then choose **Indent Chart of Accounts**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have entered definitions in the **Totaling** fields for **End-Total** accounts before executing the indent function, you must enter them again because the function overwrites the values in all **End-Total** fields.

## Delete accounts

You can delete a general ledger account. However, before you delete it, the following conditions must be true:  

* The balance on the account must be zero.  
* The **Allow G/L Acc. Deletion Before** field must be set on the **General Ledger Setup** page, and the account must not have ledger entries on or after that date.  
* If the **Check G/L Account Usage** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page is selected, the account must not be used in any posting groups or posting setup.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] prevents you from deleting a general ledger account that stores data that is needed in the chart of accounts.  

You can also specify when to allow people to delete accounts. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** toggle works together with the date in the **Check G/L Acc. Deletion After** field to act as an extra validation. If you turn on the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** toggle, you can't delete G/L accounts with ledger entries after the date in the **Check G/L Acc. Deletion After** field. To delete such an account, someone with access to the **General Ledger Setup** page must turn off the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** toggle.  

Turning on the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** field is often a best practice, as is setting the date in the **Check G/L Acc. Deletion After** field, for example, to the date through which regulations require you to store finance data.  

### Video guidance

This video shows how to specify whether, and when, people can delete G/L accounts.

# About calculating standard cost

Many manufacturing companies select a valuation base of standard cost. This choice also applies to companies that do light manufacturing, such as assembly and kitting. A standard cost system determines inventory unit cost based on some reasonable historical or expected cost. Studies of past and estimated future cost data can provide the basis for standard costs. These costs are frozen until a decision is made to change them. The actual cost to produce a product can differ from the estimated standard costs. For management control, the actual cost is compared to the standard cost for a specific item and differences, or *variances*, are identified and analyzed.  

Standard costs can be maintained for items that are replenished through purchase, assembly, and production. For each replenishment method, standard costs can consist of the following elements.  

|Replenishment System|Standard Cost Elements|  
|--------------------------|----------------------------|  
|**Purchase**|Direct material cost and overhead material cost if it's required.|  
|**Assembly**|Direct material cost, direct or fixed labor cost, and overhead cost.|  
|**Prod. Order**|Direct material cost, labor cost, subcontractor cost, and overhead cost.|  

## Set up standard costs

Because the standard cost of a produced or assembled item can consist of multiple cost elements, including material, capacity (labor) and direct and overhead subcontractor costs, standard costs must be established for each of these elements.  

The accounting task for an item-processing company using standard costing is to:  

- Estimate a standard cost of the finished item and set it up on the item card.  
- Record and allocate the actual cost of the key cost elements and to account for variances.  

To determine the direct cost of a finished item, all component costs must be totaled. An assembled or produced item can include subassemblies, which also consist of multiple components.  

The following key cost elements make up the total direct cost of a finished processed item:  

- Material costs.  
- Capacity cost.  
- Subcontracting costs for produced items only.  

### Material costs

Material costs are costs that are associated with subassemblies and purchased raw material. Material unit cost can consist of direct and indirect cost elements.  

- Direct material cost represents an invoiced amount for purchased raw materials or the processing cost of a subassembly.  
- Indirect material cost, or *overhead*, can represent elements such as inventory carrying costs for the finished item after it's produced.  

The setup of the material cost for purchased items that affect direct and indirect cost depends on the costing method that you have selected for the specified item. You set up cost information for either costing method on the item card. For more information, see [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

The cost of scrap (production only) is another factor to consider when you calculate the total material cost. When a certain amount of raw material is scrapped when you assemble or produce an item, it generally causes an increase in the quantity of components that are required to produce this item. This increases the material cost of the components that are consumed when producing a parent item. You set up scrap cost for materials on either the production BOM or routing.  

The material cost of a produced item can be represented in two ways that correspond to the following cost calculation bases.  

|Cost Calculation Basis|Material Cost Calculation|  
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|  
|Single level|Produced item is equal to the total cost of all purchased or subassembled items on that item's production BOM.|  
|Rolled-up level or multilevel|Produced item is the sum of the material cost for all subassemblies on that item's BOM and the cost of all purchased items on that item's production BOM.|  

### Capacity costs

Capacity costs are the costs that are associated with internal labor and machine costs. You must set up these costs for each resource (in assembly management) and work or machine center on the routing (in production). As with materials, you can identify both direct and indirect elements of capacity cost. For example, the direct cost for a work center can be the established shop rate to perform a specific function. The indirect cost for a work center can represent some general factory expenses, such as lighting, heating, and so on. As with material costs, you can express capacity overhead as an indirect cost percentage or a fixed overhead rate.  

The setup of the capacity costs of assembled items consists of the following elements:  

- Direct and indirect unit cost of the resource.  
- Fixed or direct resource usage type.  

The setup of the capacity costs of produced items consists of the following elements:  

- Direct and indirect unit cost of the machine or work center.  
- Time and lot size setup.  

To calculate standard capacity cost, you have to establish the standard time rates that are required to perform operations on machine and work centers. The total time to complete an operation typically consists of setup, run time, and wait and move time.  

You set up the rates for each time type for each machine or work center on an individual routing.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  While run time rates apply for each item unit that is produced, the setup time rates apply for each lot. Therefore, you must prorate the routing setup time for each operation over the lot size. You specify the lot size in the corresponding field on the **Replenishment** FastTab of the **Item Card** page.  

To specify setup time on the routing for planning but not include this expense in the standard cost calculation, clear the **Cost Incl. Setup** field on the **Manufacturing Setup** page.  

On a single-level basis, this is the labor cost that is required to produce the finished production item and is specified on the production item's routing. On a multi-level basis, this is the capacity cost that is specified for each individually produced item that is included in the parent item's BOM.  

### Subcontractor costs

Subcontractor costs are the costs that are associated with services that are provided by a company's outside vendors or subcontractors. Similar to material and capacity, subcontractor costs can consist of both direct and overhead amounts. Direct subcontractor cost represents the actual charge for each unit of services that is provided. For example, overhead subcontractor cost can represent freight and handling costs that the company incurs with a subcontracted order.  

Because subcontracting is an outsourced capacity, you set up the cost of both direct and indirect subcontracting services on the work center card that represents the subcontracting operation.  

## Populate standard cost

You can set standard cost manually or you can calculate the item's standard cost from the **Item card** page. Choose the **Production** group, then choose the **Calc. Production Std Cost** action to update cost of production items or choose the **Assembly** group, then choose the **Calc. Assembly Std. Cost** action to update cost of assembly item. The actions will consolidate and roll up the component and capacity costs to calculate the total assembly or manufacturing cost of the items. 

To calculate the unit cost of an assembly or production BOM, the parent item and its component items must use the Standard costing method. Any resources in the BOM are rolled up if they have a unit cost that is defined on the item, resource. workcenter card. Not cost defined on stockkeeping unit (SKU). 

If you have open entries, after implementing the changes to **Standard Cost** field on the item card, remember to perform inventory revaluation. For more information, see [Revalue Inventory](inventory-how-revalue-inventory.md).

## Updating standard costs with Standard Cost Worksheet

The **Standard Cost Worksheet** is intended as a tool for purchasers, production or assembly managers, and internal controllers when they have to review and update standard costs.

Use the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page to do the following:

- Prepare the changes in advance of the date when they have to take effect.
- Simulate the effect on the cost of the manufactured or assembled item if the standard cost for consumption, production capacity usage, or assembly resource usage is changed.
- Execute the changes at a given date and let them take effect immediately.

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel](includes/edit-in-excel.md)]

Purchasers use the [**Suggest Item Standard Cost**](#suggest-item-standard-cost) batch job to update and work with the costs of purchased items in one worksheet. When the result is satisfactory, the worksheet is given to the internal controller.

Production or assembly managers use the [**Suggest Work/Mach Ctr Std Cost**](#suggest-workmach-ctr-std-cost) batch job to update and work with the production capacity costs and assembly resource costs of processed items in another worksheet. This worksheet is also given to the internal controller.

Internal controllers use the [**Copy Standard Cost Worksheet**](#copy-standard-cost-worksheet) batch job to consolidate the worksheets into one worksheet. Use the [**Roll Up Standard Cost**](#roll-up-standard-cost) batch job to make a roll-up of the costs from the purchaser and the production or assembly manager. The roll-up determines the standard costs of manufactured and assembled items. Controllers can preview cost changes before and after the roll-up to identify unacceptable deviations. When the updates are acceptable, the controller implements the changes to take effect on a given date.

Use the [**Implement Standard Cost Change**](#implement-standard-cost-change) batch job to implement the standard cost changes, which updates the standard costs on the item cards of the items that are included in the worksheet. It also creates revaluation journal lines so that you can update the items in stock with the new standard cost.

### To update standard costs

1. Run the **Adjust Cost-Item Entries** batch job. To start the batch job, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Adjust Cost-Item Entries**, and then choose the related link. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
2. Run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job. To start the batch job, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**, and then choose the related link. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Standard Cost Worksheet**, and then use one or more of the following actions:
    1. Run the **Suggest Item Standard Cost** batch job.  
    2. Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
    3. Run the **Suggest Capacity Standard Cost** batch job.  
    4. Review the results and make changes as necessary.
    5. Run the **Roll Up Standard Cost** batch job.
    6. Review the results and make changes as necessary.
    7. Run the **Implement Standard Cost Changes** batch job.  
4. Review and post the **Revaluation Journal** page, which has been populated with entries from the previous steps in this process.  

### Suggest Item Standard Cost

Creates suggestions for changing the costs and cost shares of standard costs on item cards. When the batch job has completed, you can see the result in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

> [!NOTE]  
> This batch job is intended for purchased items only. If you want to update an item with a production BOM or assembly BOM, then you must first fill in the worksheet with all the components and then run the **Roll Up Standard Cost** batch job.

This batch job only creates suggestions. It doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them,  then select **Implement Standard Cost Changes** in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

#### Options

**Standard Cost**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the standard cost. You can also select a rounding method for the new standard cost. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

**Indirect Cost %**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the indirect cost %. You can also select a rounding method for the new indirect cost %. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

**Overhead Rate**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the overhead rate. You can also select a rounding method for the new overhead rate. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

### Suggest Work/Mach Ctr Std Cost

Creates suggestions for changing the costs and cost shares of standard costs on work center, machine center, or resource cards. When the batch job has completed, you can see the result in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

This batch job only creates suggestions. It doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them,  then select **Implement Standard Cost Changes** in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

When you have run the batch job and want to see the impact on your production or assembly departments, then you run the **Roll Up Standard Cost** batch job to update standard costs on work centers, machine centers, assembly resources, production BOMs, and assembly BOMs.

#### Options
**Standard Cost**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the standard cost. You can also select a rounding method for the new standard cost. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

**Indirect Cost %**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the indirect cost %. You can also select a rounding method for the new indirect cost %. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

**Overhead Rate**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the overhead rate. You can also select a rounding method for the new overhead rate. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

### Copy Standard Cost Worksheet

Copies standard cost worksheets from several sources into the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

You can only copy one worksheet at a time. The lines from the copied worksheets will be placed below each other in the consolidated worksheet. Item lines are listed first, then work/machine center lines are listed, and resource lines are listed last.

### Roll up standard cost

Rolls up the standard costs of assembled and manufactured items. These are influenced by the change in standard costs of components suggested by the **Suggest Item Standard Cost** batch job. In addition, they're influenced by the change in standard cost of production capacity and assembly resources suggested by the **Suggest Work/Mach Ctr Std Cost** batch job.

Once you have run either or both of these batch jobs and you do the roll-up, then all changes to the standard costs in the worksheet are introduced in the associated production or assembly BOMs, and the costs are applied at each BOM level.

> [!NOTE] 
> This function only rolls up the standard cost on the item cards, not on the SKU cards.

This batch job only creates suggestions. It doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them, then you can use the **Implement Standard Cost Change** batch job. 

#### Options

**Calculation Date**: Enter the date that applies to the production BOM version you want to do the roll-up for.
 
### Implement standard cost change

Updates the changes in the standard cost in the **Item** table with the ones in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page. The standard cost change suggestions can be created with the **Suggest Item Standard Cost** and/or the **Suggest Work/Mach Ctr Std Cost** batch job, and they can also be modified. The contents of all the fields in the standard cost change suggestions are transferred. When you implement suggestions of changes to standard costs, you can see them on the item card and/or on the work/machine center cards. A revaluation journal is also created for you to update the value of existing stock.

#### Options

**Posting Date**: Enter the date that the revaluation should take place.

**Document No.**: Enter the number of the revaluation journal lines. If there's a number series set up on the item journal batch name, the document number follows the ledger entries made by the posting of the revaluation journal. Otherwise, you can manually enter a number.

**Item Journal Template**: Enter the name of the revaluation journal template.

**Item Journal Batch Name**: Enter the name of the actual revaluation journal

Select **OK** to start the batch job. If you don't want to run the batch job now, select **Cancel** to close the window.

Review and post the **Revaluation Journal** page, which has been populated with entries from the previous steps in this process.

# Set up approval workflows

You can set up and use workflows that connect business-process tasks performed by different users. System tasks, such as automatic posting, can be included as steps in workflows, preceded or followed by user tasks. Requesting and granting approval to create new records are typical workflow steps. Learn more at [Use Approval Workflows](across-use-workflows.md).

Before you begin to use approval workflows, you must set up workflow users and approval users, specify how users receive notifications about workflow steps, then create the workflows.

On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling in fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values that represent scenarios supported by the application code.

[!INCLUDE[workflow](includes/workflow.md)]

# Set Up Business Central Access in Teams with Microsoft 365 Licenses

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Administrators must complete multiple activities before users can access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with their Microsoft 365 license. The steps below represent the minimum setup required to get started. To learn more about access with Microsoft 365 licenses, go to [Business Central Access with Microsoft 365 Licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md).

## Guidelines

Setting up access with Microsoft 365 licenses involves the following tasks:

|Step|Task|Required|
|-|-|-|
|1|[Configure which Business Central data the Microsoft 365 licensed users have permission to view](#configure-permissions)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
|2|[Enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses on the Business Central environment](#enable-access-with-microsoft-365-licenses)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
|3|[Assign security group to the environment](#choose-who-gets-access-by-using-security-group)|
|4|[Deploy the Business Central app for Teams to users](#deploy-the-business-central-app-for-teams)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
|5|[Test the setup](#test-your-setup)||

> [!TIP]
> Except for the last task, you can complete the tasks in any order. You can do tasks separately, as described in the sections that follow or use the **Access with Microsoft 365 licenses** assisted setup guide to walk you through them.
>
> To run the assisted setup, do the following steps:
>
> 1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link.
> 2. On the **Assisted Setup** page, go to the **Do more with Business Central** section and select **Access with Microsoft 365 licenses**.
> 3. Follow the instructions.  

## Configure permissions

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is secure by design and minimizes risk by granting no permissions to Microsoft 365 users out of the box. Administrators must configure object permissions that determine which tables, pages and reports can be accessed in Teams with only a Microsoft 365 license. These permissions are the starting permissions assigned when a user signs in for the first time with their Microsoft 365 license. 

To configure starting permissions:

1. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], search for **License Configuration**.
2. Select the Microsoft 365 license.
3. At the top of the **Microsoft 365** license page, select the edit icon ![Edit icon](media/edit-pencil.png), then turn on **Customize permissions**. 
4. In the **Custom Permission Sets** section, add the appropriate permission sets and choose whether they're applicable to a single company or all companies within the environment.

With this configuration, users with only a Microsoft 365 license are added to the **Users** list when they access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for the first time. For more information about users, go to [Creating Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When synchronizing the users list in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with users in Microsoft 365, only users that have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license are added to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s users list. For more administrative control over permissions and profiles, you can assign a security group to the environment. When environments are secured using a security group and enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses, the **Update users from Microsoft 365** action in the **Users** page will also include users that only have a Microsoft 365 license. To learn about securing environments, see [Manage access using Microsoft Entra groups](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access#manage-access-using-azure-active-directory-groups) in the developer and IT pro help.

> [!TIP]
> Looking for a quicker way to get started when trying out this feature on a sandbox or evaluation company? Assign the **D365 Read** permission set, which grants permission to most objects.  

When working with multiple environments, license configuration must be applied to each environment and can be different on each environment.

Learn more at [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md) and [Composing Permission Sets](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-permissionset-composing).

## Enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses

Access with Microsoft 365 licenses is off by default. Access must be enabled for each environment independently, giving administrators control and allowing for staged rollout across the organization. You turn on access by using the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] admin center: 

1. In the upper-right corner, select **Settings** ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") > **Admin Center**.  
2. In the admin center, select **Environments**, then select the environment on which you want to change license access. 
3. On the **Environment details** page, select **Modify** for the **Access with Microsoft 365 licenses** setting.
4. In the **Microsoft 365 licenses** pane, turn on the switch. 
5. Select **Save** when done and accept the confirmation. The change comes into effect immediately.

## Choose who gets access by using security group

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

In the Business Center admin center, an environment can be assigned to one or more security groups to control access. You can assign a Microsoft Entra group to the environment. By assigning a Microsoft Entra group to an environment, only direct and indirect members of the group are granted access to the environment. Indirect members are users in another group, which itself is a member of the group assigned to the environment. Although all licensed users in Microsoft Entra ID will be added to the environment when it's synchronized with Microsoft 365, only group members can sign in. Learn more in [Manage access using Microsoft Entra groups](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access#manage-access-using-azure-active-directory-groups) in the developer and IT pro help.

People in the security group must also have an applicable Microsoft 365 license to access Business Central from within Microsoft Teams. Get a list of applicable licenses in [Business Central access with Microsoft 365 licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md#requirements-for-individual-users-to-access-data-in-teams).

## Deploy the Business Central app for Teams

For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license holders to share data in Teams, and for Microsoft 365 license holders to access that data, each must have the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams installed. Although users can install the app by themselves, it's recommended that administrators use centralized deployment. Centralized deployment lets you roll out the app to a broader audience across the organization and minimize individual user effort. Laern more in [Installing the Business Central app by using Centralized Deployment](admin-teams-integration.md#installing-the-business-central-app-by-using-centralized-deployment).

> [!NOTE]
> If you have run centralized deployment before and only deployed the app to the security group of licensed [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users, you'll need to run it again to deploy to additional groups or the whole organization, depending on how you are configuring access.

> [!TIP]
> Looking for a quicker way to get started when trying out this feature? Test users can install the app at [aka.ms/BCgetTeamsApp](https://aka.ms/BCgetTeamsApp).

## Test your setup

To verify that your setup is ready for production, the following steps will help you build the confidence that everything works as it should.

1. Create or identify two test users (A and B).

   - Test user A must have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license and Microsoft 365 license with access to Teams.
   - Test user B must have only a Microsoft 365 license with access to Teams.

2. Sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] web client as test user A.

   1. Open a record that test user B should have access to, such as an **Item** card in the appropriate company and environment.
   2. Select **Share** ![!Share to other apps action on pages.](media/share-icon.png) > **Share to Teams** to bring up the Share to Teams window.
   3. In the **Share to** field, add test user B as the recipient.
   4. Wait for the link to expand to a card and select Share.

3. Sign into Microsoft Teams as test user B.

   1. Select Chat and open the conversation with test user A.
   2. In the message sent by test user A, select the Details button on the card. If the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client is displayed and is read-only, your setup was successful.

# Use Power Automate flows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you're given a license to Microsoft Power Automate. This license lets you use your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data as part of a workflow in Microsoft Power Automate. You create flows and connect to your data from internal and external sources through the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connector.

Power Automate flows are triggered by events, such as a record being created, modified, or deleted. Flows can also be run on a user-defined schedule or on demand.

> [!NOTE]
> Administrators can restrict access to Power Automate. If you find that you don't have access to some or all of the features described in this article, talk to your admin. If you want to learn how you can control Power Automate access as an admin, see [Set Up Power Automate Integration](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-automate-setup).

<!-- You must have a valid account with both [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Power Automate. --> 

> [!TIP]
> In addition to Power Automate, you can use approval workflow templates in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Although they're two separate workflow systems, any approval workflow template you create with Power Automate is added to the list of workflows within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Workflows](across-workflow.md).

## About Power Automate flows

Power Automate is a service that helps you create automated workflows (or flows) between apps and services, like [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Power Automate flows require little or no coding knowledge. They can be associated with a wide range of events and responses, such as:

- Record changes
- External files updates
- Posted documents
- Different Microsoft and third-party services, like Microsoft Outlook, Excel, Dataverse, Teams, SharePoint, Power Apps, and more.

There are three different cloud flow types that you can work with:

|Flow type|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|Automated flow|This flow type is run automatically by an event. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an event could be when a record or document is created, modified or deleted. So, for example, a new sales invoice can trigger a flow for an approval request, which can have different events set depending on the approver's reply. A negative response sends a notification and email to the approval requester. A positive reply simultaneously updates an Excel spreadsheet located in a SharePoint folder and sends an update to a Teams chat. Automated flows can be started by both internal and external events in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|
|Approval flow|Approval flows are also automated flows in Power Automate, but they're designed specifically for requesting approval when changes are made to records and data. You can use approval flows in Power Automate as an alternative to the [approval workflows feature](across-use-workflows.md) that's part of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. |
|Scheduled flow|This type of flow is also automatically run but it runs periodically at a scheduled date and time. |
|Instant flow|This flow type is run on-demand, requiring the user to run it manually from a button or action in another app or device, in this case, the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client. Instant flows work similarly to batch shortcuts, performing multiple lengthy steps with a few button presses and are launched from specific pages or tables. For example, a flow can add a button to the action menu on the **Vendors** page to block payments to a vendor and, at the same time, send customizable emails to the vendor's contact and your company's purchasers as well as update the contact in Outlook. |

## Power Automate features

You can explore all Power Automate flows currently available to you by signing in to [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.com) and selecting **My flows** from the navigation bar on the left. Here you find any flows you have already created yourself and flows shared with you by an admin or coworker.

- Instant flows are also made available for running directly from most list, card, and document pages in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You find the instant flows in the **Automate** action group in the action bar of pages. To run a flow, select it, and follow the instructions presented to you. Learn more in the sections that follow.

- With automated flows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], there's nothing for you to do, unless you want to change them, or turn them off. Otherwise, they just work when triggered. 
<!--

## Automated flows

With Power Automate, you can create business flows directly in-house and rely on citizen developers. Automated workflows can be started by both internal and external events in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and also be set to run periodically. Learn more and get instructions on how to create flows in the [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) article in the administration content.

-->

## Run instant flows

Instant flows open inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online so you can remain within the context of the business process you were in the middle of doing. You can run an instant flow from most lists, cards, or documents.

1. In the action bar, select **Automate**, then choose a flow from the list of available flows under the **Power Automate** action.

    :::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-instant-menu.svg" alt-text="Shows the Automate action with instant flow actions.":::

    On some pages, **Automate** is nested under **More options (...)**. 
2. In the **Run Flow** pane, fill in any required fields, then select **Continue** to run the flow.

> [!NOTE]
> The first time you use the **Automate** item, you may see only the **Get started with Power Automate** action. You see this action because you haven't agreed to the privacy notice for Microsoft Power Automate. To continue, select **Get started with Power Automate** and follow the instructions to agree or disagree.  
>
> :::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-action.png" alt-text="Shows the Automate item in the action bar.":::

<!--

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can run a Power Automate flow from most list, card, and document pages. Once the admin has connected [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Power Automate, you'll see any flows your organization has added when you choose the **Automate** action on the relevant pages. Instant flows are run without leaving [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in the [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) article in the administration content.

These instant flows open on a page inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online so you can remain within the context of the business process you were in the middle of. Choose the **Automate** action—on some pages nested under the **More Options** menu—choose the **Power Automate** menu item, then choose the relevant link to trigger the workflow. The connection to Power Automate is already set up for you.

Most flows require you to fill in a field or two before you choose the **Run flow** action.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't see an **Automate** action, then your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] probably hasn't yet been set up to use Power Automate. Learn more from your admin.-->

## Create, edit, and manage flows

Creating new flows or modifying and managing existing ones (like turning them on or off) can be done directly in Power Automate. But you can initiate some of these tasks from the Automate action menu in  [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

:::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-menu.svg" alt-text="Shows the Automate action in the action bar with expanded actions.":::

- To create an automated flow from a list, card, or document page, select **Automate** > **Create automated flow**.
- To create an approval workflow from a card or document page, select **Automate** > **Create approval flow**.

  > [!TIP]
  > This action is only available on card and document type pages; not lists.
- To create an instant flow from a list, card, or document page, select **Automate** > **Create action based on a flow**.
- To open Power Automate from a list, card, or document page, select **Automate** > **Manage flows**.
<!--- To create new flows or manage existing flows from inside [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], got to the **Manage Power Automate Flows** page.-->

These tasks are typically done by an admin or super user. The tasks require a broader knowledge of the business processes in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to the following articles in the Business Central Dev and IT Pro help:

- [Power Automate integration](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-automate-overview)
- [Create automated flows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) (also covers approval flows)
- [Create instant flows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/instant-flows)
- [Manage Power Automate flows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/manage-power-automate-flows)
<!-- 

## Add more automated flows and instant flows

You can create flows through the [powerautomate.microsoft.com](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com) website. However, if your admin has switched on the capability to run Power Automate flows from inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can start the process of building a flow from the **Automate** action on the relevant pages, which can be found under the **More Options** menu depending on the page. Then choose the **Power Automate** menu item, and then choose the **Create a flow** action. Power Automate then opens in a new browser tab, and you're signed in automatically.

You can find sample templates to adapt to your company and all available trigger events, using both [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and external tools, by choosing the **Connectors** menu on the Power Automate website. Learn more about available templates and triggers in the [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) article in the administration content.

## Create and manage Power Automate flows

You can create new flows or manage existing Power Automate flows in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on the **Manage Power Automate Flows** page. Learn more in the [Manage Power Automate Flows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/manage-power-automate-flows) article in the administration content.

<!--
You can also manage available Power Automate workflows on the **Workflows** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# Entering Data

There are many general features that help you enter data easier, faster, and more precise. The basic principles and advanced features for entering data are described in this article.  

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

The examples in this article use the demonstration data.

## Work with editable fields

Fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] may contain different editable data, such as text or currency amounts. Editable fields typically display an input box where you can type or choose a value. Non-editable fields are typically displayed with a gray background.

Some editable fields provide a picker to help you specify a value.  

<!-- TODO: Add illustrations or images of each picker -->
|**Picker**        |**How it helps you specify a value**|
|------------------|------------------------------------|
|Date picker       |This picker displays a calendar that is based on your current regional settings. It helps you choose a single date.|
|Dropdown          |Dropdowns provide a choice of fixed values or reference records from another table|
|Switch or Checkbox|Some fields provide a simple choice of *Yes* or *No* values. The switch is used to specify this value, and is always displayed as a checkbox in lists|
|Assist edit       |Some fields provide custom pickers that are suited to looking up and choosing the best value for that field, such as popup window|

### Modifying a field value

To modify the value of a field, you must first set focus to that field. You set focus by doing the following actions:

- Use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key. The action selects the entire value.
- Left-click your mouse or similar input device. This action will only select the entire field value if the field is in a list.  

When you interact with fields in the user interface, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] typically favors selecting the entire field value to make it easier for you to replace that value.

When the entire field value is selected:

- Replace the value by just typing to specify a new value. If the field offers a picker, you can activate it using the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> keyboard shortcut.
- Use the <kbd>Delete</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key to clear the value.

select the <kbd>F2</kbd> key to toggle between selecting the entire field value or placing the cursor after the field's value. Placing the cursor at the end of the value makes it easier for you to append to the existing value.

When the cursor is shown at the end of the field value:
- Add to the value by just typing.
- Use the <kbd>Home</kbd>, <kbd>End</kbd>, <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>, and <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> keys to move the cursor within the value. If you're editing a field in a list, selecting the <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> key again when the cursor is at the beginning of the value will set focus to the previous field. Similarly, selecting the <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> key again when the cursor is at the end of the value will set focus to the next field.

> [!NOTE]
> After you specify a value, Business Central will only check that it's valid after you click outside the field or set focus to another element, such as the next field.  

[!INCLUDE [background_doc_journal_check](includes/background_doc_journal_check.md)]

## Use Copilot's autofill feature to assist in filling in fields

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

When drafting a new record or editing an existing record, Copilot can suggest values for editable fields on the page. Learn more in [Autofill fields with Copilot (preview)](autofill-fields-with-copilot.md).

## Keyboard Shortcuts

There are several keyboard shortcuts that let you work "mouse-free" and speed up your data entry. These keyboard shortcuts are especially useful with large-scale entries and repetitive typing tasks.

For more information about shortcuts, see [Keyboard Shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md). A few of the keyboard shortcuts are discussed in this article.

## <a name="QuickEntry"></a>Accelerating Data Entry Using Quick Entry

Quick Entry is a feature designed for data entry when using the keyboard. Quick Entry works on fields (like on card pages) and in lists (rows and columns). It's beneficial when doing repetitive typing tasks that require creating multiple records in sequence. Examples include a batch of sales orders or registering new items.

You can use the Tab key to navigate from one field on a page to the next editable field. A disadvantage of using Tab is that it always goes sequentially to the next field. <!-- even if the field is non-editable or seldom filled it in.-->Quick Entry lets you change this path. With Quick Entry, you use the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to navigate through only those fields that you're interested in. Quick Entry skips non-editable fields and fields that you typically don't fill in. You might have already noticed this behavior on some pages. This behavior is because the fields to include when pressing Enter and which ones to skip have been predefined. You can customize Quick Entry by personalizing your workspace and optimizing how you enter data on each page.

### How Quick Entry Works

Every field can be marked as either *included in Quick Entry* or *excluded from Quick Entry*. Fields that are included in Quick Entry will be included in the path when you select <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Fields that are excluded from Quick Entry won't.

When you're finished entering data in a field, you simply select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to confirm the changes and go to the next field. If you want to reverse direction, and go the previous field, select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>. For more information about shortcuts, see [Quick Entry Shortcuts for Fields](keyboard-shortcuts.md#QuickEntry).

#### Tips and Tricks

The following list provides some useful information about using Quick Entry.

- It's available for any editable fields.
- It also works across columns and rows.
- It doesn't prevent accessing other elements of a page, such as actions. These elements are still accessible by using <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>.  
- It's not required that FastTabs are expanded for Quick Entry to work. If the next Quick Entry field is located in a collapsed FastTab, that FastTab will automatically expand and focus on the chosen field. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will remember that the FastTab should be expanded next time you visit the page.  
- Quick Entry works no matter whether fields are mandatory. So it's a good idea to ensure that mandatory fields are included in Quick Entry.
- By default, most fields are automatically included in Quick Entry. So initially your task will most likely be excluding fields from Quick Entry.

### To change Quick Entry fields

To set up Quick Entry on fields, you use personalization.

1. Start personalization by selecting the ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") icon, and then the **Personalize** action.
2. Select a field that you want change. In lists, select the corresponding column heading. Then, choose either **Include in Quick Entry** or **Exclude from Quick Entry**.

For more information about personalization, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Mandatory Fields

When you enter data on pages, certain fields are marked with a red asterisk. The red asterisk means that the field must be filled to complete a certain process. An example is when you post a transaction that uses the value in the field.  

Although a field is mandatory, you aren't forced to fill the field before you continue to other fields or close the page. The red asterisk only serves as a reminder that you'll be blocked from completing a certain process.  

## Finding Data As You Type

 When you start to type characters in a field, a drop-down list is displayed and shows possible field values. The list changes as you type more characters, and you can select the correct value when it's displayed.  

 Many fields have a down arrow button that you can choose. You choose the arrow to get a list of data that is available to enter in the field. The button has two functions depending on the type of field:  

- Lookup - Displays information from another table that you can enter in the field. You can select one piece of data at a time.  

- Drop-down - Displays the set of options that exist for the field. You can select only one of the options.  

## Copying and Pasting FAQ Fields and Lines

You can copy one or more rows from a list or a single field on a page. Then paste what you copied into the same page, another page, or an external document. You could, for example, paste to Microsoft Excel or Outlook email. In short, to copy, select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> (cmd+C in macOS) on your keyboard. To paste, select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> or <kbd>cmd+V</kbd> in macOS.

In a list, to copy the field in the same column of the row above, and paste it into the current row, just select <kbd>F8</kbd>.

For more information, see [Copying and Pasting FAQ](faq-copy-paste.yml).

## Filtering Line Items

To start filtering, select ![Filter pane icon](media/open-filter-pane-icon.png "Filter pane icon") at the top of the list or select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd> to open the filter pane. You work with the filter pane as you do on any other list. For more information, see [Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#filtering).

Filtering is especially helpful when viewing and analyzing longer documents. Imagine you open a posted sales invoice. Then, you filter the line items to display all line items that have an individual discount above 5%. Or, you filter to display only bike accessories with 'pro' in the name.

## <a name="Focus"></a>Focusing on Line Items

When working on documents that include a line items part, you can switch your view to focus only on the line items. Example documents are sales order or invoice page. The line items part expands so that it occupies almost the entire workspace. It hides other parts of the page except the actions area at the top. This layout gives you a better overview of the lines items, and provides more room to work on them.

You'll benefit particularly when you work with large line item lists and you want to enter data fast. This feature also provides advanced filtering capability. Like on other lists, browsing and searching through line items becomes even easier.

### Switching the Focus On and Off

To focus on lines items, select anywhere in the line item part, and then choose ![Focus Mode icon.](media/focus-mode.png "Focus mode icon") in the upper right corner, or select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd>.

To switch back to the normal view, choose ![Focus Mode icon.](media/focus-mode.png "Focus mode icon") or select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd> again.

## Multitasking Across Multiple Pages

You can open a card or document page in a new window. Opening a new window lets you:

- Work on multiple tasks at the same time
- Manage interruptions to the current task, such as taking an incoming call.
- Keep a window open for an ongoing task while you start or complete another task in windows.

To open the current card or document in a new window, choose ![Open New Window.](media/open-new-window-icon.png "Open new window icon") in the upper right corner, or select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd>.

<!--
When working on multiple tasks at a time or when managing interruptions to the current task, such as taking an incoming call, you can open a card or document page in a new window. This allows you to keep a window open for an ongoing task while you start or complete another task in one or more other windows.
-->

> [!NOTE]
> When you open other pages from a card or document that is opened in a new window, those pages will open in a new window even though you don't choose ![Open New Window.](media/open-new-window-icon.png "Open new window icon").

> [!NOTE]
> If you work in the Safari browser, a pop-up blocker may cause the new window to not open. If this is the case, specify the product URL as an allowed website. For information see, [Change preferences in Safari](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2102965).<br /><br />
> The same may happen in other browsers, such as Firefox. For more information, see [Pop-up blocker settings in Firefox](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2116400).  

Another way to multitask is to open [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on two or more browser tabs. When you do it this way, you should create a new tab and then copy/paste the URL of the original tab into the new tab. This way creates a new session.   

> [!NOTE]
> Don't use the **Duplicate** function of the browser to create the new tab as this may cause actions on one tab to block actions on other tabs because they are part of the same session.

## Entering Quantities by Calculation

When entering numbers into quantity fields, such as the **Quantity** field on an item journal line, you can enter the formula instead of the sum quantity.  

### Examples  

- If you enter 19+19, the field is calculated to 38.  

- If you enter 41-9, the field is calculated to 32.  

- If you enter 12*4, the field is calculated to 48.  

- If you enter 12/4, the field is calculated to 3.  

## Entering Negative Numbers

You can enter negative numbers in two ways. The number -20.5 can be entered as:  

- -20.5  

  or
- 20.5-  

In both cases, the amount will be recorded in as -20.5.  

If the last character of the expression is a **+** or a **-**, the entire expression will be recorded with that sign. An example, **10-20+** will result in 10 and not -10.  

## Entering Dates and Times

You can enter dates and times in all the fields that are assigned to dates (date fields). You can enter dates with or without separators.

> [!NOTE]  
> How you enter dates and times depends on your **Region** settings. For more information, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).  

### Entering Dates

You can either use the data picker to select a date from a calendar, or you can enter dates manually. This section provides a brief overview of how to enter dates. For more information, see [Work with Calendar Dates and Times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

For manually date entry, you can enter two, four, six, or eight digits:  

- Two digits are interpreted as the day. It will add the month and the year of the work date.  

- Four digits are interpreted as the day and the month. It will add the year of the work date.  

- If the date you want is in the range 01/01/1950 through 12/31/2049, enter the year with two digits. Otherwise, enter the year with four digits.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the two-digit year range may be different. Administrators can change the range by modifying the **CalendarTwoDigitYearMax** setting of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] server. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#General).

You can also enter a date as a weekday followed by a week number. Or, you can enter a year. For example, Mon25 or mon25 means Monday in week 25.  

Instead of entering a specific date, you can enter one of these codes.  

|Code|Result|  
|--------------|----------------|  
|t|Specifies today's date (the system date for the computer).|  
|p|Specifies an accounting period, where p means the first accounting period, p2 means the second accounting period, and so on. |
|w|Specifies the work date that is set up in the application. To change the work date, see [Changing Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md). You may want to use a work date if you have many transactions with a date other than today's date.|
|c|Specifies that the date after c is a closing date, for example C123101.|  

## Entering Times

When you enter times, you can insert any separator sign that you want between the units, but it isn't required. You don't have to write minutes, seconds, or AM/PM.  

The following table lists the various ways in which times can be entered and how they're interpreted.  

|Entry|Interpretation|  
|---------------|------------------------|  
|5|05:00:00|  
|5:30|05:30:00|  
|0530|05:30:00|  
|5:30:5|05:30:05|  
|053005|05:30:05|  
|5:30:5,50|05:30:05.5|  
|053005050|05:30:05.05|  

 You enter two digits for each unit of time if you don't enter a separator.  

## Entering Combined Datetimes

[!INCLUDE [datetimes](includes/datetimes.md)]

## Entering Duration

You enter a duration as a number followed by its unit of measure.  

Here are some examples.  

|Duration|Unit of measure**|  
|------------------|-------------------------|  
|2h|2 hrs|  
|6h 30 m|6 hrs 30 mins|  
|6.5h|6 hrs 30 mins|  
|90m|1 hr 30 mins|  
|2d 6h 30m|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins|  
|2d 6h 30m 56s 600ms|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins 56 secs 600 msecs|  

 You can also enter a number and it's automatically converted to a duration. The number you enter is converted according to the default unit of measure that has been specified for the duration field.  

 To see the unit of measure used in a duration field, enter a number and see which unit of measure it's converted to.  

 The number 5 is converted to 5 hrs, if the unit of measure is hours.  

## <a name="decimal"></a>Setting the decimal separator used by numeric keyboards

When using the <kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> key on a numeric keypad to enter data, the actual decimal separator that's entered in the field is determined by your region setting in Business Central. Most regions use the period (.) or comma (,) symbol as a separator for decimal values, as you would typically see in currency amounts. The decimal key on your keypad adapts to your region. It's often different to the period or comma keys on the rest of your keyboard. You set the region in Business Central on the **My Settings**  page.

For example, suppose you're using a numeric keyboard that uses a period (.) as the <kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> key. But you're entering data for a regional language that uses a comma (**,**) for the decimal separator, like French (France). So, you want decimals like "1.23" to be entered as "1,23". In this case, you can go to the **My Settings** page and set the **Region** to the target regional language to **French (France)**. For more information, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md#region).

> [!TIP]
> There may be occasions when you want to use the decimal separator to enter a period (.). For example, suppose you were entering a date range in a filter, like `01/01/2022..04/01/2022`, or anything that requires a period. To accommodate this case, select the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> keys on the numeric keyboard. This key combination switches the decimal separator between outputting a period and the decimal separator as determined by the **Region** setting.

# Assign Default Bins to Items
If you are using bins at a location, assigning default bins to your items can make the process of shipping, receiving, and moving your items much easier. When a default bin is assigned to an item, this bin is suggested every time you initiate a transaction for this item. Default bins are defined on the **Bin Content** page.  

## To assign a default bin to an item
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bin Content Creation Worksheet**, and choose the related link.  
2.  Fill in the bin code and item information for each bin that you would like to set up as a default for an item. Make sure to select the **Default** field.  
3.  Choose the **Create Bin Content** action. Default bins are now assigned for your item.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  When an item is put away, if the item does not have a default bin assigned, the bin where the item is put away is assigned as the default.  

## To change the default bin for an item  
You may need to change the default bin assignment for an item or assign a default bin to a new item.
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bin Contents**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the **Location Filter** field, select the appropriate location code.  
3.  Find the current default bin content entry for the item and clear the **Default Bin** check box.  
4.  Find the bin content line for the bin that you would like as the new default bin. Select the **Default Bin** check box.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  When an item is put away for the first time, and the item does not have a default bin assigned, the system will assign the bin where the item is put away as the default bin for the item.

# Register new vendors

Vendors provide the products you sell. Each vendor you purchase from must be registered with a vendor card.

Before you register new vendors, you must set up various purchase codes to select from when you fill in vendor cards. After all the required master data is created, you can add unique characteristics for a vendor, such as prioritize the vendor for payment purposes or list items that the vendor and other vendors supply. Another group of setup tasks for vendors is to record your agreements concerning discounts, prices, and payment methods. Learn more at [Setting Up Purchasing](purchasing-setup-purchasing.md).

Vendor cards hold the information required to buy products from each vendor. Learn more at [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md) and [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).
<br /><br />  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=7188b662-bc49-45ef-8152-82898076b235]

## Adding new vendors

You can add new vendors manually, by filling out the **Vendor Card** page, or you can use templates that contain predefined information. For example, you can create templates for different types of vendor profiles. Using templates saves time when adding new vendors, and helps ensure the information is correct each time.

> [!NOTE]  
> If vendor templates exist for different vendor types, when you begin to create a new vendor card you'll see a page from which you can select the appropriate template. If only one vendor template exists, then new vendor cards always use that template.

After you create a template, you can use the **Apply Template** action to apply it to one or more selected vendors. To create a template, fill in the information you want to reuse on the **Vendor Card** page, then save it as a template. Learn more in the [To save the Vendor Card Page as a template](purchasing-how-register-new-vendors.md#to-save-the-vendor-card-as-a-template) section.

> [!TIP]
> It can be helpful to personalize the **Vendor Template** page when you create a template. For example if want to add a field that is not already displayed on the page. Learn more in the [Personalize your workspace](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-personalization-user#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode) section.

You can also create a vendor from a contact. Learn more in the [Creating a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact) section.

Remit-to addresses are used when you print checks to pay your vendors, and vendors can have multiple remit-to addresses for payments. For example, a vendor might supply an item from a subsidiary company, but wants to receive payment at their headquarters. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] lets you set up multiple mailing addresses for each vendor, and you can choose the correct location to send payments to on an invoice-by-invoice basis.

You specify remit-to addresses on Vendor Card pages, and on the Shipping & Payments FastTab on purchase orders and invoices. When you create payment journal lines using the Pay Vendor or Create Payment actions on the Vendors list page or Vendor Card page, or the Apply Entries action on a payment journal, the remit-to code on the vendor ledger entry is assigned. You can overwrite this value.

### To create a new vendor

[!INCLUDE[create_new_vendor](includes/create_new_vendor.md)]

> [!TIP]  
> If you do not know the invoicing address to be used for every invoice from a vendor, do not fill in the **No.** field on the **General** FastTab. Instead, choose the pay-to vendor number after you have set up a purchase quote, order, or invoice header.

The vendor is now registered, and the vendor card is ready to use on purchase documents.

If you want to use this vendor card as a template when you create new vendor cards, you can save it as a vendor template. Learn more in the [To save the vendor card as a template](#to-save-the-vendor-card-as-a-template) section.

### Deleting and editing vendor information

You can edit the information on vendor cards at any time. However, if you have posted a transaction for a vendor, you cannot delete the card because the ledger entries may be needed for auditing. To delete vendor cards with ledger entries, contact your Microsoft partner to do so through code.

> [!TIP]
> You can change the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) on a vendor bank account without the change affecting your historical credit transfer register entries. Credit transfer register entries store the *Recipient IBAN* and the *Recipient Bank Account No.* specified in the **Vendor Bank Account** and **Recipient Name** fields from the **Vendor Card** page when the entries were created.

> [!TIP]
> You can add alternative addresses on vendor cards by choosing the **Order Addresses** action.

## To save the vendor card as a template

1. On the **Vendor Card** page, choose the **Save as Template** action. The **Vendor Template** page opens showing the vendor card as a template.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To reuse dimensions in templates, choose the **Dimensions** action. The **Dimension Templates** page opens showing any dimension codes set up for the vendor.
4. Edit or enter dimension codes to apply to new vendor cards created using the template.
5. When you have completed the new vendor template, choose **OK**.  
   The vendor template is added to the list of vendor templates, so you can use it to create new vendor cards.

# Work Center Load (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Work Center Load** report measures the load and the allocated capacity of each work center. Use this report to ensure that work centers aren't overloaded.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/work-center-load.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Work Center Load Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/work-center-load.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use this report to ensure that loads on work centers don't exceed their available capacity. By analyzing the load percentage and allocated time, you can identify overloaded work centers and take steps to reduce the workload. For example, you might adjust the production schedule or allocate more resources to a particular work center. Additionally, by monitoring the work center load, you can ensure room for contingencies in cases where a work center is loaded to 100%.

Production supervisors use this report to analyze the load percentage and allocated time for work center loads and report them to the manufacturing manager. This information helps ensure that the workload is distributed evenly across all work centers so production runs smoothly.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Work Center Load* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [Load %](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#load)
- [Allocated Time (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#allocated-time-hours)
- [Capacity Available (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#capacity-available-hours)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Calendar Entry
- Production Order Routing Line
- Work Center

# Income Statement by Month (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Income Statement by Month** report provides a detailed, month-to-month view of net changes across all income statement accounts, organized in a hierarchy for intuitive navigation. You can explore specific details by drilling down to the **Income Statement Drill-Through** report, which provides access to the underlying ledger entries.

This report is for senior management and finance administrators, offering a profit and loss overview that supports financial analysis, performance tracking, and informed decision-making.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/income-statement-by-month-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Income Statement by Month report" lightbox="media/finance/income-statement-by-month-report.png":::

## Use the report

CFOs use the report to analyze monthly profitability trends for the fiscal year. For example, you might review the month-to-month changes in both operating expenses and revenue to identify drivers in overall profitability.

Finance administrators use the report to manage and review the operating expenses by a Department dimension. For example, if you spot an unexpected rise in costs, you could filter the report by department to identify the department responsible for the increased expenditure. This information can help you investigate and realign the department budget, if needed.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Net Change**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#net-change)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

# Troubleshooting Your Company Hub

Adding companies to the company hub dashboard is easy enough, but this article addresses issues that you may have on the way.  

## Check errors

Use the **Check Errors** action to view a list of recent errors. You can see additional details for each error, and you can clean up the log by deleting older entries.  

## Connection failed

There can be a couple of reasons why you cannot connect to a company, including the following:

- The URL in the **Environment Link** field is not valid  

  Go to the **Environment Links** page, open the environment that you cannot connect to, and then choose the **Test the connection** action.  
- The client's company is currently offline, for example if it being upgraded

  In your dashboard, choose the **Tools** menu item, and then choose **Check Errors**. This opens a list with technical details, so you might want to contact your administrator if you're seeing errors. For example, the error message "*The server has rejected the client credentials*" suggests that you do not have access.  
- You do not have access to all companies in the environment that you are trying to connect to

  In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an organization can have multiple business units called companies, and you might not have access to all companies. Work with your administrator or client to make sure that you have access to the companies that you have to work in.  

## Data does not refresh

When you add a company or request a refresh of the data, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fetches the data. But you must refresh the page yourself, such as choosing the **Reload all companies** action, refresh the browser page, navigate away from the dashboard and then back again, or similar.  

If you've added a company but it is not displaying in the list, you can also use the **Reload all companies** action to update the list.

# Chat with Copilot FAQ

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article answers some common questions about chatting with Copilot in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For questions related to AI and chat, consult [Responsible AI FAQs for chat with Copilot](faqs-chat-with-copilot.md).

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## Can admins grant or deny permission to individual users to get access to chat?

Starting in 2025 release wave 1 (update 26.0), admins can control precisely who has access to Chat with Copilot. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md#granting-user-access).

## Can Copilot answer questions about any records? 

When you chat with Copilot about records and pages, Copilot searches your company data within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on your behalf and can only access the data you have permission to access. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s extensive security, privacy, and compliance controls also apply to Copilot. For example, you can't ask Copilot to show masked or secret fields or retrieve records controlled by record-level security.

## Is chat available on tablet, phone, or other form factors?

No, the chat pane is only available on the [!INCLUDE[web_client](includes/web_client.md)].

## In which countries or regions can I chat with Copilot?

Starting in update 25.4, chat is available in all [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] countries and regions. If you're unable to access the chat pane, find the answer in [What can I do if the chat pane doesn't show?](#what-can-i-do-if-the-chat-pane-doesnt-show)

## I don't use Business Central in English. What are my options?

As of January 2025, chat is available no matter which language you use in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Does chat work with my customizations?

It depends on the type of question you ask Copilot. For example:

- If you ask questions to find records, it can find records in your custom tables that use custom fields.
- If you ask Copilot for an explanation or guidance, it doesn't have access to any information about your customizations or documentation for your add-ons.

Learn how to improve Copilot output as a developer in [Influencing Copilot and agents without extending them](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/copilot-and-agents-influence-without-extending).

## How does Copilot locate records? 

When you ask to find a single record, multiple records, or a field from a record, Copilot uses various mechanisms to search for this information. Copilot generates the appropriate sorting and filtering on list pages and their corresponding source tables. It uses the fields on the page and fields on the underlying tables as part of these operations and in its responses.

## Does Copilot have access to all fields on a table? 

No. Copilot has access to most but not all fields when finding records. For example, it excludes fields that might contain passwords or other secrets. Learn which field data types are excluded in [Influencing Copilot and agents without extending them](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/copilot-and-agents-influence-without-extending).

Similarly, when you ask Copilot to show a specific field from a record, some fields are excluded and might not be part of Copilot’s response. For example, if your admin hasn't given you permission to personalize Business Central, Copilot shows only the fields typically displayed by default on the list pages.

## How do I open a record or page from chat?

When you ask Copilot to find records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], it shows any records it finds as selectable tiles or links in the chat pane. While in preview, Copilot doesn't automatically navigate to any page.

## Why do I get different answers from Copilot for the same question?

Copilot might occasionally answer in different ways. Answers aren't always identical.

## How do I use the Copy function on chat messages?

You can use the Copy button to copy a message from earlier in your conversation with Copilot, paste it into the input box to try again or try a variation of your message to Copilot.

## Can I customize or extend chat?

While in preview, the chat pane and Copilot's responses can't be modified directly through customization, add-ins, tools, or personalization. 
Learn about how to influence Copilot output as a developer in [Influencing Copilot and agents without extending them](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/copilot-and-agents-influence-without-extending).

## Does Copilot search for data in other companies or environments?

Copilot only searches for records in the company you're currently signed into. It doesn't search for data across multiple environments or companies.

## How does chat treat data residency? 

The chat feature relies on Azure OpenAI Service for AI and Microsoft Learn for online documentation. Learn more about data residency and Azure OpenAI Service in [Azure OpenAI Service and Business Central data](azure-openai-data.md) and [Copilot data movement across geographies](ai-copilot-data-movement.md).

Microsoft Learn online service endpoints are available in the US, Switzerland, and Europe Azure geographies. For EU customers, this means their data never leaves the EU Data Boundary, and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always connects to endpoints in Switzerland or Europe Azure geographies.

If your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment is deployed to any other Azure geography, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connects to the Microsoft Learn online service outside your environment's geographic region or compliance boundary. When you use chat to ask for explanations on how to do things in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], only a few search keywords derived from your message to Copilot are sent to the Microsoft Learn online service in a different Azure geography. They're processed and not stored for more than one day.

To prevent chat from connecting to the Microsoft Learn online service, deactivate the chat feature using the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md#activate-features).

## What can I do if the chat pane doesn't show?

- Make sure your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is version 25.4 or later.
- For Business Central versions 25.4 to 25.5, make sure the entry for "Chat with Copilot" is enabled for all users in the **Feature Management** page.
- Make sure you have permission to chat with Copilot. Learn more in [Configure Copilot & agent capabilities](enable-ai.md#granting-user-access).
- For Business Central version 26 and later, make sure **Chat** is active in the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. In some countries and regions, Chat with Copilot isn't active by default. Learn more in [Configure Copilot & agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

## How is Microsoft improving chat with Copilot?

We're continually working on improving reliability and response time. We announced the next expansion of chat where Copilot can answer questions about how to use installed add-on apps. Learn more in [Chat with Copilot to learn how to use installed add-on apps](/dynamics365/release-plan/2025wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/chat-copilot-learn-use-installed-add-on-apps).

We encourage administrators to try out experimental features on sandbox environments. To experience the latest improvements to chat, enable the **Feature: Enables advanced navigation (not data) search capabilities by utilizing semantic similarity search on application metadata.** key on the **Feature Management** page. This feature uses superior AI technology to match user inquiries with the names of pages, fields, and tables. Learn more in [Use semantic search to find pages and reports with Copilot chat](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/semantic-search-feature-key).

We look forward to getting your feedback about how Copilot can provide better assistance to your workday.

## Why does Copilot only show three records in the chat pane?

When you ask Copilot to find records, the way you phrase the question determines how Copilot identifies and applies filters on pages to find what you are looking for. To keep answers concise, the chat pane displays a maximum of three record tiles, even when Copilot finds more relevant records.

## Why does Copilot give incorrect answers to calculations?

While in preview, chat with Copilot can help you find records, explain concepts, and guide you to how to complete tasks in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Other use cases aren't supported, such as adding up a field across records or calculating the average monthly amount. We hope to add basic mathematics abilities to Copilot in the future.

## Can I use speech instead of typing my prompts?

You can chat with Copilot by using voice typing to talk instead of type your words in the chat pane. Voice typing uses online speech recognition and is available with Windows. To use voice, activate the chat message box, then use the <kbd>Windows</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> shortcut and start speaking. Learn more at [Use voice typing to talk instead of type on your PC](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/use-voice-typing-to-talk-instead-of-type-on-your-pc-fec94565-c4bd-329d-e59a-af033fa5689f).

# Post the Year-End Closing entry

After you use the **Close Income Statement** batch job to generate the year-end closing entry or entries, you must open the journal you specified in the batch job, and then review and post the entries.  

> [!TIP]
> Depending on your organizations work processes, you can choose to close or not close accounting periods and fiscal years in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The following procedure assumes that you have closed the fiscal year using the *Accounting Periods* option, generated a year-end closing entry using the **Close Income Statement** batch job, and are now ready to post the year-end closing entry along with the offsetting equity account entries. Your organization can choose to work differently, such as post the year-end closing entry as part of closing the fiscal year.

## To post the year end closing entry

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **General Journals** page, in the **Batch Name** field, select the batch that contains the closing entries.
3. Review the entries.
4. To post the journal, choose the **Post** action.

> [!NOTE]  
> If an error is detected, an error message is displayed. If the posting is successful, the posted entries are removed from the journal. After posting is complete, an entry is posted to each income statement account so that its balance becomes zero and the year's result is transferred to the balance sheet.

# Close open item ledger entries resulting from fixed application in the item journal

You can use the **Applies-from Entry** field on the **Item Journal** page to create a fixed application between an inbound transaction and the original outbound transaction. For example, to correct the outbound transaction or to process its return.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Fixed applications made in this manner only apply the cost, not the quantity. Accordingly, the posted positive item ledger entry will not close the applied outbound entry and will itself remain open. This also applies when you post a fixed application for a positive entry to a negative entry that has not been closed by a regular positive entry, then both the negative and the positive entries will remain open.  
>
> This also means that you cannot close an inventory period if such an entry exists.  

You can change and reapply application entries under certain conditions by using the **Application Worksheet** page.  

The following procedure shows how to close such entries by performing two corrective postings in the item journal.  

## To close open item ledger entries that result from a fixed application in the item journal  

1. Use the **Applies-from Entry** field to post a positive adjustment with the corresponding quantity. This closes the original negative entry with a fixed application.  

    The **Applies-from Entry** field specifies the number of the outbound item ledger entry whose cost is forwarded to the inbound item ledger entry when you post an inbound transaction of type **Positive Adjmt.** or **Purchase** with the item journal.  
2. Use the **Applies-to Entry** field to post a negative adjustment. This closes the original corrective positive entry with a fixed application.  

    The **Applies-to Entry** field specifies if the quantity in the item journal line should be applied to an already-posted document. If so, enter the entry number of the item ledger entry to which the item journal line should be applied.

# FAQ for marketing text suggestions with Copilot

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the [!INCLUDE[feature-marketing-text-suggestions](includes/feature-marketing-text-suggestions.md)] feature in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What is item marketing text suggestions?

Copilot provides writing assistance for users responsible for authoring marketing text (also known as copy) on items in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This feature is known as [!INCLUDE[feature-marketing-text-suggestions](includes/feature-marketing-text-suggestions.md)]. The [!INCLUDE[feature-marketing-text-suggestions](includes/feature-marketing-text-suggestions.md)] feature provides writing assistance for users responsible for authoring marketing text (also known as *copy*) on items in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The feature is available on any item card in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To use it, just open an item and then select **Marketing Text** > **Draft with Copilot**. This action automatically generates a text suggestion that's engaging, creative, and specific to the item that's shown. Suggestions are based on various inputs, including:

- The item's attributes, category, and name.
- Personal writing style preferences, like tone of voice, emphasized quality, format and length.

You can change the value of these input options to influence the outcome of the AI-generated text. Before you save a suggestion, you can easily review and edit it for accuracy or try another suggestion.

Some key benefits of this feature include:

- Decreases the time used on copy writing, which can accelerate time-to-market for items being sold in online shops.
- Unlocks creativity to provide more engaging product descriptions.
- Improves consistency of marketing material for product lines.

## What are the system's capabilities?

The [!INCLUDE[feature-marketing-text-suggestions](includes/feature-marketing-text-suggestions.md)] feature uses Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service to access powerful language models that analyze and generate natural language. These models have been trained on a wide body of text datasets. As a result, Copilot can generate suggested, personalized responses in English based on a minimal amount of input data, like an item's attributes, category, or description. Learn more about Azure OpenAI Service at [Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview).

## What is the system's intended use?

This feature is intended to assist users in creating marketing text for items in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Writers use the feature to quickly get compelling and engaging text suggestions, which are then reviewed and edited for accuracy. 

## How was item marketing text evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

- The feature underwent extensive testing where numerous texts in different languages were evaluated by language experts against various criteria. Testing was based on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s demonstration data and other fictitious product catalogs.

## Use the report

The report is ideal for business leaders and purchasing managers who need to monitor purchase performance in the last 12 months.
  
CEOs can use the report to monitor the overall purchasing performance over the last 12 months. You can analyze the figures for Moving Annual Total (MAT) and Previous Year Moving Annual Total (PYMAT) and identify trends in purchasing amounts in line with the company's growth. If your purchasing amount exceeds your growth rate, you can use this information to develop a strategic plan that focuses on reducing inventory costs or optimizing purchasing budget. The report can also help you identify periods of high purchasing costs and work with purchasing managers to reduce them.

Purchasing managers can use this report to analyze the purchasing data over the last 12 months, and analyze purchase amounts for specific periods. You can identify purchasing performance by analyzing the MAT growth and growth percentage in each month. These measures offer insight into how your team performs during each period. By identifying the areas where purchasing increased, you can take necessary actions to optimize the purchasing process and ensure you're using purchasing budget efficiently.

# Set up posting groups

Posting groups map entities to general ledger accounts. Examples of entities are customers, vendors, items, resources, and sales and purchase documents. Posting groups save time and help avoid mistakes when you post transactions. The transaction values go to the accounts specified in the posting group for that particular entity. The only requirement is that you have a chart of accounts. For more information, see [Set Up the Chart of Accounts](finance-setup-chart-accounts.md).  

Posting groups are covered under three umbrellas:  

* General

  Define who you sell to and buy from, and what you sell and what you buy. You can also combine groups to specify things like the income statement accounts to post to, or use groups to filter reports.  
* Specific

  Use sales documents, for example, instead of posting directly to the general ledger. When you create entries in the customer ledger, corresponding entries are made in the general ledger.  
* Tax

  Define the tax percentages and calculation types that apply to who you sell to and buy from, and what you sell and what you buy.

The following sections describe the posting groups under each umbrella.  

## General posting groups

The following table describes the general posting groups.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| General Business Posting Groups |Assign this group to customers and vendors to specify who you sell to, and who you buy from. Set up these posting groups on the **Gen. Business Posting Groups** page. When you do, think about how many groups you need to break down sales and purchases. For example, group customers and vendors by geographical area, or by the type of business. |
| General Product Posting Groups |Assign this group to items and resources to specify what you sell, and what you buy. Set up these posting groups on the **Gen. Product Posting Groups** page. When you do, consider the number of groups you need to break down sales by product (items and resources) and purchases by items. For example, divide these groups by raw materials, retail, resources, capacity, and so on. |
| General Posting Setups |Combine business and product posting groups and choose the accounts to post to. For each combination of business and product posting groups, you can assign a set of general ledger accounts. For example, you can post the sale of the same item to different general ledger accounts because customers are assigned to different business posting groups. Set these configurations up on the **General Posting Setup** page. |

## Specific posting groups

The following table describes the posting groups that are specific to types of data.

|Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Customer Posting Groups |Define the accounts to use when you post accounts receivable transactions. If you use inventory with receivables, the accounts that the sales order lines post to are determined by the general business posting group assigned to your customer, and the general product posting group assigned to the inventory item. See *General Business Posting Groups* and *General Product Posting Groups* in the [General posting groups](#general-posting-groups) section. Set up these posting groups on the **Customer Posting Groups** page. |
| Vendor Posting Groups |Define where to post transactions for payables accounts, service charge accounts, and payment discount accounts. This is similar to customer posting groups. Set up these posting groups on the **Vendor Posting Groups** page. |
| Inventory Posting Groups |Define inventory posting groups that you then assign to the relevant item accounts on the **Inventory Posting Setup** page. This way, when you post entries concerning an item, the system posts to the G/L account that is set up for the combination of inventory posting group and location that is linked to the item. Inventory posting groups also provide a good way to organize your inventory, so you can separate items by their posting group when you generate reports. Set up these posting groups on the **Inventory Posting Groups** page. |
| Bank Account Posting Groups |Define the general ledger accounts that bank account entries are posted to. For example, this can simplify the processes of tracing transactions and reconciling bank accounts. Set up these posting groups on the **Bank Account Posting Groups** page. We recommend that these G/L accounts have the **Direct Posting** field set to *No*. |
| Fixed Assets Posting Groups |Define accounts for different types of expenses and costs, such as acquisition costs, accumulated depreciation amounts, acquisition costs on disposal, accumulated depreciation on disposal, gains on disposal, losses on disposal, maintenance expenses, and depreciation expenses. Set up these posting groups on the **FA Posting Groups** page. |

### Allow substitute customer or vendor posting groups on documents

You can let people choose other customer and vendor posting groups than the default groups when they're working with sales or purchase documents and journals.

To allow changes to customer posting groups, choose **Allow Multiple Posting Groups** on the **Sales & Receivable Setup** and **Service Mgt. Setup** pages, and the **Purchase & Payables Setup** page for vendor posting group changes.

On the **Customer Posting Groups** or **Vendor Posting Groups** pages, you can specify the posting groups to allow as substitutes by choosing **Substitutions**. Substitute posting groups can replace the default customer or vendor posting groups specified for a customer or vendor.

After you set this up, you can choose from the allowed substitute posting groups and change the customer or vendor posting group when posting sales or purchase documents and journals. The substitute customer or vendor posting groups are copied to posted documents and journals, and payable or receivable G/L entries are posted to the G/L accounts specified for the substitutes.

When applying, for example, an invoice and payment that are posted with different customer or vendor posting groups (different G/L accounts), [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] transfers the amounts between the G/L accounts to balance them.

## Tax posting groups

The following table describes the tax-related posting groups.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Tax Business Posting Groups |Determine how to calculate and post sales tax for customers and vendors. Set up these posting groups on the **Tax Business Posting Groups** page. When you do, think about how many groups you need. For example, it might depend on factors like local legislation, and whether you trade both domestically and internationally. |
| Tax Product Posting Groups |Indicate the tax calculations needed for the types of items or resources you buy or sell. |
| Tax Posting Setup |Combine tax business posting groups and tax product posting groups. When you fill in a general journal line, purchase line, or sales line, we look at the combination to identify the accounts to use. |

If your country/region uses value-added tax (VAT), see [Set Up Calculations and Posting Methods for Value-Added Tax](finance-setup-vat.md).  

## Example of linking posting groups

Here's a scenario.  

These posting groups are chosen on the customer card:  

* General business posting group
* Customer posting group  

These posting groups are chosen on the item card:  

* General product posting group  
* Inventory posting group  

When you create a sales document, the sales header uses the customer card information, and the sales lines use the item card information.  

* The revenue posting (income statement) is determined by the combination of the general business posting group and the general product posting group.  
* The accounts receivable posting (balance sheet) is determined by the customer posting group.  
* The inventory posting (balance sheet) is determined by the inventory posting group.  
* The cost of goods sold posting (income statement) is determined by the combination of general business posting group and general product posting group.  

Your setup determines when posting happens. For example, the timing is affected by when you do periodic activities, such as posting inventory cost or adjusting cost item entries.

## Copy posting setup lines

The more product and business posting groups you have, the more lines you'll have on the **General Posting Setup** page. While there might be many different combinations of business and product posting groups, different combinations might still post to the same general ledger accounts. To limit the amount of manual entry, copy the general ledger accounts from an existing line on the **General Posting Setup** page.

## Set up posting groups on the go

To get users started faster, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can show notifications of missing G/L accounts in various posting group setups. To get these notifications, make sure that the **G/L Account is missing in posting group or setup** notification is selected in the **My Notifications** page, which you can access from the **Change when I receive notifications** field in the **My Settings** page.  

This way, when you work on a document that uses a posting group or a setup that is missing a required general ledger account, you get a notification. Choose the link in the notification to open a page where you can make the relevant changes, provided you have permission to do so.  

> [!NOTE]
> In order to take you directly to the posting group or setup that is missing a general ledger account, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will create a placeholder posting group or setup. Posting groups and setups are a way for the accountant to control how entries are posted to the general ledger, so such the just-in-time creation of posting groups and setups might not be allowed in your organization.  
>
> In that case, disable the *G/L Account is missing in posting group or setup* notification, and then work with your accountant to make the relevant changes to the posting group, setup, or your document. This is an important step, because after documents are posted, you can't delete incorrectly used posting groups or setups because general ledger entries are created for them.

Use the **Blocked** field in the **General Posting Setup** page to prevent users from mistakenly using a setup that is no longer relevant for new postings. 

## Access all fields and accounts when you set up a posting group  

Posting groups can be complex to set up. Because some types of accounts aren't frequently used, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't show them as columns on the lines. Also, to make it a bit easier to choose the right accounts, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] filters the accounts that you can choose in field lookups. 

If you want to access all accounts on the lines and in the field lookups, there are a couple of settings that can help:

* To show all accounts as columns on the lines, turn on the **Show All Accounts** toggle.
* On individual lines, to access all accounts in the field lookups, choose the **View All Accounts on Lookup** checkbox.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Show All Accounts** toggle might not seem to work on the **General Posting Setup** page. That's because [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always shows all accounts as columns on the lines on that page.

## Troubleshooting posting group errors

Posting groups are one of the more advanced concepts to set up in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If they aren't set up correctly, errors can occur when posting documents or journal lines. For example, these errors are typically caused by a mistake in how general ledger accounts are assigned, or how posting groups are combined.

When something is wrong, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will display the **Error Messages** page. The **Error Messages** page can make it easier to identify and resolve the issue. The page offers a description of the error that points out the posting group setup that needs attention. For example, the message might read "Sales Prepayment account is missing a General Posting Setup." There's also a link to open the page that's the source of the issue, so you can quickly resolve it.  

> [!NOTE]
> The error handling described above is not available on item, resource, employee, and fixed asset journals, or for G/L accounts added in local versions of posting groups.

## Audit changes to posting groups

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your posting group setup. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)]

The following table lists the table for posting group and their IDs.

| Table | Table ID |
| ----- | -------- |
| Gen. Product Posting Group | 251 |
| Customer Posting Group | 92 |
| Inventory Posting Group | 94 |
| FA Posting Group | 5606 |
| Vendor Posting Group | 93 |

# Company information overview

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] organizes business entities in *companies*. For each company, you must fill in some of the basic company details and relevant information on the **Company Information** page. The information on the [**Company Information**](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1) page is used in documents, such as invoice headers. You can set up more than one company, such as a parent company and a subsidiary.  

If the company's inventory warehouse is located at a different address than the company headquarters, you can complete the various ship-to fields and the **Location Code** field on the **Shipping** FastTab. The information in these fields is then printed on purchase orders, for example, so vendors ship items to the correct location.  

For each company you set up, you must fill in the **Company Information** page, together with the **General Ledger Setup** page. You must also set up each area in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, for each company. Learn more at [Overview of Tasks to Set Up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](setup.md).  

The **Company Information** page contains different fields and FastTabs, depending on your country/region. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] The following table describes the most common FastTabs.

[!INCLUDE [admin-company-info-fasttabs](includes/admin-company-info-fasttabs.md)]

After you fill in the information, you can close the page.  

## Working with multiple companies

If your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes multiple companies, your users might want to use *company badges* to help them quickly identify and keep track of which company they're currently working in. For more information, see [Display a company badge](#badge).

There are a few features you can use to switch among companies as you work, like the company switcher (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>). Learn more at [Switch to Another Company or Environment](ui-organization-switch.md).

## <a name="badge"></a>Display a company badge

When there's more than one company or environment, the company switcher shows on the upper-right side of the app bar near the search icon. By default, the company switcher uses a standard company icon, like ![company icon Launcher.](media/ui-experience/company-icon.png "Displays the company switcher icon used when there is a single environment") and ![company-icon-mult-env](media/ui-experience/company-icon-multi-env.png "Displays the company switcher icon used when there are multiple environments").

:::image type="content" source="media/ui-experience/company-switch-2.png" alt-text="Shows the company switcher icon in the heading of the Business Central client.":::  

Starting in 2023 release wave 2, version 23, the company badge appears in the browser tab when using the web client. It's also in page links that you [copy and paste](across-share-data-features.md#copying-a-link) in rich text editors, like Word, Outlook, and Teams.

The following video shows how to work with company badges.

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=fefe2ce4-d700-4e04-b319-b8557e75dfe9]
 
### Set the company badge

On the **Company Information** page, you can replace the standard company icon with a custom badge on a per-company basis. A company badge can make it easier to identify the company you're working in.

1. On the **Company Badge** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
2. When done, refresh the browser (select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd>) to update the badge in the client.  

> [!TIP]
> A company badge also indicates the type of environment the company is in. A round company badge signifies a production environment, and a square badge signifies a sandbox environment.

## Change company display name

The company name is always displayed at the top left corner and works as an action that you can choose to go back to the Role Center. You can change this name on the **Company Information** page.

1. Choose the ![Sprocket icon to open the Settings menu.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png) icon, and then choose the **Company Information** action.
2. In the **Name** field, enter the new company name.
3. Leave the page. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] restarts and displays the new company in the top-left corner.

## Experience

The default user experience in a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] trial doesn't reveal all capabilities. You can switch on the full experience on the **Company Information** page.  

For more information, go to [Change Which Features are Displayed](ui-experiences.md).

2. Select the location where you want to set up bin contents,  and then choose the **Bins** action.  
3. Select the bin where you want to set up contents, and then choose the **Contents** action.  
4. For each item that you want to store in the bin, fill in a line on the **Bin Contents** page with the appropriate information. Some of the fields are filled in already with information about the bin.  
5. First fill in the **Item No.** field, and then, if you are using directed put-away and pick, fill in the other fields such as the **Unit of Measure Code**, **Max. Qty.**, and **Min. Qty.** fields.  

Select the **Fixed** field if necessary. If the bin is to be used as the default bin for the item, select the **Default Bin** field.  

If you are using directed put-away and pick, and if you have entered the correct dimensional information on the item card about each item's units of measure, the maximum quantity that you enter on the **Bin Contents** page is verified against the physical capabilities of the bin. The minimum and maximum quantities are used when calculating bin replenishment and suggested put-aways.  

If you select the **Fixed** field, you are fixing the item to the bin, meaning that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will try to put this item in the bin if there is space for it, and it will preserve the record fixing the item to the bin even when the quantity in the bin is 0. Other items can be put into the bin, even though a particular item has been fixed to the bin.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can set up several bin contents at the same time on the **Bin Content Creation Worksheet** page.  

## To create bin content with a worksheet

When you have created your bins, you can create the bin content that you want for each bin in the bin content creation worksheet.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bin Content Creation Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the worksheet header, in the **Name** field, select the worksheet of the location where you want to create bin contents.  
3. In the **Bin Code** field, select the code of the bin for which you want to define bin content.  

    If you are using directed put-away and pick in this location, the fields relating to that particular bin, such as **Bin Type**, **Warehouse Class Code**, and **Bin Ranking**, will be filled in automatically. This is information that you need to consider as you define the bin content.  
4. Select the item that you want to assign to the bin, and fill in the fields related to the bin content. If you are using directed put-away and pick, and you want to use the **Calculate Bin Replenishment** function, fill in the **Max. Qty.** and **Min. Qty.** fields.  

    To set this bin as the preferred bin for the item even if the bin quantity is **0** and all other put-away criteria equal, select the **Fixed** field.  
5. Repeat steps 3 through 4 for each item you want to assign to a bin.  
6. Choose the **Print** action to preview and print the bin content you have entered in the worksheet. Continue to revise the bin content until you are satisfied.  
7. When you are ready, choose the **Create Bin Content** action.  

In this worksheet, you can work with a number of bin content lines for a number of bins and thereby obtain a good overview of what you are putting into various bins in a given zone, aisle, or rack.

# Set up cost accounting

Before you start working with cost accounting, you must perform setup tasks.

## Balances between Cost Type, Cost Center, and Cost Object

When you set up cost accounting, you must make sure that all entries are assigned to a cost type as well as a cost center or a cost object. The means that each cost entry must have a cost type assigned and a cost center code or a cost object assigned. This rule ensures that each cost entry appears in either the cost centers or the cost objects, but never in both places.  

By doing this, you create the following accounting equation:  

*Cost Type Balance* = *Cost Center Balance* + *Cost Object Balance*  

When you print the chart of cost type, the chart of cost centers, and the chart of cost objects reports, you can analyze this relationship.

## Set up Cost Types

The chart of cost types is similar to the chart of accounts in the general ledger. You can set up the chart of cost types in the following ways:  

- Structure the chart of cost types similar to the income statement accounts in the general ledger chart of accounts. Then, you can transfer the general ledger chart of accounts to the chart of cost types. You can make any necessary adjustments after the transfer.  
- Create new chart of cost types or add new cost types to existing chart of cost types. You must create each new cost type individually.  

### To transfer the general ledger chart of accounts to the chart of cost types

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Cost Types**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Get Cost Types from Chart of Accounts** action. In the dialog box, choose the **Yes** button to confirm the transfer. The function uses the chart of accounts to create a chart of cost types.  

    The chart of cost types now contain all income statement accounts in the general ledger and include headings and subtotals. You can change the chart of cost types, as necessary. For example, you can delete duplicate existing cost types.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  The **Register Cost Types in Chart of Accounts** function updates the relationship between the chart of accounts and the chart of cost types. The **No.** field is filled and verified to make sure that each general ledger account is related to only one cost type. The function runs automatically before transferring general ledger entries to cost accounting.  

### To set up new cost types in the Chart of Cost Types page

1. Open the **Chart of Cost Types** page in edit mode.  
2. Fill in the fields as described as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can set up and maintain cost types in either the **Cost Type Card** page or on the **Chart of Cost Types** page. In this procedure, you set up cost types on the **Chart of Cost Types** page.

3. After you have created all cost types, choose the **Indent Cost Types** action. In the dialog box, choose the **Yes** button.  
4. Link the new cost type to the corresponding general ledger account.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  If you have entered definitions in the **Totaling** fields for the line type of **End-Total** before you run the **Indent Cost Types** function, then you must enter the definitions again because the function overwrites the values in all **End-Total** fields.  

### To update cost types

1. On the **Cost Accounting Setup** page, select if you want the chart of cost types to be automatically updated when the chart of accounts is changed.  
2. In the **Align G/L Account** field, you can choose from the following options.  

- **No Alignment** - There is no corresponding change in the chart of cost types when you change the chart of accounts.  
- **Automatic** - A corresponding change is made in the chart of cost types when you change the chart of accounts.  
- **Prompt** - A message is displayed asking if you want to make a corresponding change in the chart of cost types when you change the chart of accounts.

## Defining the Relationship Between Cost Types and General Ledger Accounts

The relationship between the cost type and the general ledger account is created in the cost type and in the general ledger account.  

- The **G/L Account Range** field in the **Cost Type** table establishes which general ledger accounts belong to a cost type.  
- The **Cost Type No.** field in the chart of accounts establishes which cost type a general ledger account belongs to.  

These two fields are filled automatically when you use the **Get Cost Types from Chart of Accounts** function.  

### Relationship Between General Ledger Accounts and Cost Types

There is an n:1 relationship between general ledger accounts and cost types. Several general ledger accounts can belong to one cost type, but each general ledger account belongs to only one cost type. The following table describes the details in the relationship.  

|Relationship|**G/L Account Range**|**Cost Type No.**|  
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|  
|One general ledger account for each cost type|One general ledger account|One cost type|  
|Several general ledger accounts for one cost type|General ledger account range, for example, 7110..7193 for each general ledger account|For each general ledger account in the range, there is only one cost type|  
|Cost types without corresponding general ledger accounts|\<Empty\>||  
|General ledger accounts whose entries will not be transferred||\<Empty\>|  

### Cost Types Without a Relationship to the General Ledger

A cost type may not have a relationship to general ledger accounts if one of the following conditions is true:  

- Accounts for operational accounting, such as Calc. Interest and Depreciation, only take costs from the operational accounting.  
- Helping cost types, such as cost types 9901, 9902, and 9903 in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database, are used as credit and debit accounts for allocations.  
- The helping account, 9920 in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database, contains actual accruals that show the difference between costs and the expense from the general ledger.

## Setting Up Cost Centers

Cost centers are departments that are responsible for costs and income. The chart of cost centers is similar to the dimension information for the general ledger. You can set up the chart of cost centers in the following ways:  

- Transfer dimension values in the general ledger to the chart of cost centers. You can make any necessary adjustments after the transfer.  
- Create a new chart of cost center that is independent of the general ledger or add a new cost center to an existing chart of cost center. You must create each cost center individually.  

### To transfer dimension values in the general ledger to the chart of cost centers

1. Set up a dimension to be the cost center dimension on the **Cost Accounting Setup** page. Only the values from this dimension are transferred.
You can choose **Update Cost Acctg. Dimensions** action to update cost accounting dimensions.
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Cost Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Get Cost Centers from Dimension** to transfer dimension values to the chart of cost centers. The function transfers the dimension values that you defined in step 1.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can set up the **Align Cost Center Dimension**  field to define a one-way synchronization of dimension values from the general ledger to the chart of cost centers. You cannot define a synchronization of the chart of cost centers to dimension values from the general ledger.  

The chart of cost centers now contains all specified dimension values from the general ledger and includes titles and subtotals.  

### To create new cost centers in the Chart of Cost Centers page

You can set up and maintain cost centers in either the **Cost Center Card** card or on the **Chart of Cost Centers** page. In this procedure, you set up cost centers on the **Chart of Cost Centers** page.  

1. Open the **Chart of Cost Centers** page in edit mode.  
2. In the **Code** field, enter the cost center code. All cost centers must have a code.  
3. In the **Name** field, enter the cost center name.  
4. Choose the drop-down arrow in the **Line Type** field to specify the purpose of the cost center.  

    - For cost centers of the **Total** type, you must fill in the **Totaling** field. Use the **or** operator, which is a vertical line (**&#124;**) to set ranges of cost centers.  
    - For cost centers of the **End-Total** line type, this field is filled in automatically when you use the indent function.  
5. Fill in the **Sorting Order** and **Cost Subtype** fields.  
6. Choose the next empty line to create a new cost center, and then repeat steps 2 through 5.  
7. After you have set up all the cost centers, choose the **Indent Cost Centers** action. Choose the **Yes** button.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you have entered definitions in the **Totaling** fields for **End-Total** cost centers before you run the indent function, then you must enter them again. The function overwrites the values in all **End-Total** fields.

## Setting Up Cost Objects

Cost objects are projects, products, or services of a company. The chart of cost objects is similar to the dimension information for the general ledger. You can set up the chart of cost objects in the following ways:  

* Transfer dimension values in the general ledger to the chart of cost objects. You can make any necessary adjustments after the transfer.  
* Create a new chart of cost object that is independent of the general ledger or add a new cost object to an existing chart of cost objects. You must create each cost object individually.  

### To transfer dimension values from the general ledger to the chart of cost objects

1.  Set a dimension to be the cost object dimension on the **Update CA Dimensions** page. Only the values from this dimension are transferred.  
2.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Cost Objects**, and then choose the related link.  
3.  Choose the **Get Cost Objects from Dimension** action to transfer dimension values to the chart of cost objects. The function transfers the dimension values that you defined in step 1.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can set up the **Align Cost Object Dimension**  field to define a one-way synchronization of dimension values from the general ledger to the chart of cost objects. You cannot define a synchronization of the chart of cost objects to dimension values from the general ledger.  

The chart of cost objects now contains all specified dimension values from the general ledger and includes titles and subtotals.  

### To create new cost objects in the Chart of Cost Objects page

You can set up and maintain cost objects in either the **Cost Object Card** card or on the **Chart of Cost Objects** page. In this procedure, you set up cost objects on the **Chart of Cost Objects** page.  

1.  Open the **Chart of Cost Objects** page in edit mode.  
2.  In the **Code** field, enter the cost object code. All cost objects must have a code.  
3.  In the **Name** field, enter the cost object name.  
4.  Choose the drop-down arrow in the **Line Type** field to specify the purpose of the cost object.  

    * For cost objects of the **Total** line type, fill in the **Total From/To** field. Use the **or** operator, which is a vertical line (**&#124;**), to set ranges of cost objects.  
    * For cost objects of the **End-Total** line type, this field is filled in automatically when you use  the indent function.  
5.  Fill in the **Sorting Order** field.  
6.  Chose the next empty line to create a new cost object, and then repeat steps 2 through 5.  
7.  After you have set up all the cost objects, choose the **Indent Cost Objects** action. Choose the **Yes** button.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you have entered definitions in the **Total From/To** fields for **End-Total** cost objects before you run the indent function, then you must enter them again. The function overwrites the values in all **End-Total** fields.

## Defining Cost Centers and Cost Objects for Chart of Accounts

You can automatically transfer the expense and income entries from the general ledger to cost accounting either for each general ledger posting or with a batch job. When you do the transfer, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only transfers the entries that are already linked to a cost center or a cost object. To establish a meaningful transfer, you must ensure that the cost centers and cost objects are correctly defined.  

### Defining Default Dimension Values for General Ledger Accounts

For each general ledger account, you can define default dimension values in the **Default Dimension** table. The following example shows how to define that there should always be a DEPARTMENT cost center, but never be a PROJECT cost object when posting to a general ledger account.  

|**Dimension Code**|**Value Posting**|  
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|  
|Department|Code Mandatory|  
|Project|No Code|  

### Defining Dimension Values for Overhead Costs and Direct Costs

 You can transfer overhead costs to a cost center and direct costs to a cost object. The following table shows the optimal combination of the dimension setup values.  

|Transfer To|Cost Center Posting|Cost Object Posting|  
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|  
|Cost Center|Code Mandatory|No Code|  
|Cost Object|No Code|Code Mandatory|  

> [!NOTE]  
>  To make sure that the predefined cost center and cost object that you set up in the general ledger are automatically carried over to cost accounting, select the **Check G/L Postings** check box on the **Cost Accounting Setup** page.

# Reconcile vendor payments with the payment journal or from vendor ledger entries
When you send a payment or receive a refund from a vendor, you must decide whether to apply the payment or refund to one or more open entries. You can specify the exact amount that you want to apply to the payment receipt or refund, and then only partially apply vendor ledger entries. You must apply all vendor ledger entries to obtain correct vendor statistics and reports of the account statements and finance charges.

> [!NOTE]  
>   Vendors may sometimes give a payment refund instead of a credit memo to offset against future invoices, especially when you return items that you have already paid for or when you have overpaid an invoice.

You can apply vendor ledger entries in three different ways:

* By entering information in dedicated pages, such as the **Payment Journals** page and the **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page.
* From purchase credit memo documents.
* From vendor ledger entries after purchase documents are posted but not applied.

> [!NOTE]  
>   If the **Application Method** field on the vendor card contains **Apply to Oldest**, then payments will automatically be applied to the oldest open credit entry if you do not manually specify which entry to apply to. If the application method for a customer is **Manual**, then you must apply entries manually.

You can apply vendor payments manually to their related purchase documents when you post the payments on the **Payment Journals** page. For information about filling the payment journal, see [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).

You can also apply vendor payments, and customer payments, after the payments appear as negative bank transactions in your bank. On the **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page, you can use functions for bank statement import, automatic application, and bank account reconciliation. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).

## To apply a payment to a single or multiple vendor ledger entries
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Payment Journals** page, on the first journal line, enter the relevant information about the payment entry.
3. To apply a single vendor ledger entry:
   1. In the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field, choose the field to open the **Apply Vendor Entries** page.
   2. On the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, select the entry to apply the payment to.
   3. On the line in the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount to apply to the entry.
4. Or, to apply multiple vendor ledger entries:

   1. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
   2. On the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, select the lines with the entries to apply the payment to.
   3. Choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action.  
   4. On each line in the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount to apply to the individual entry.

      If you don't enter an amount, then the maximum amount is automatically applied. At the bottom of the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, you can see the amount in the Applied Amount field, and you can see whether the application balances.
5. Choose the **OK** button.
6. Choose the **Post** action to post the payment journal.

## To apply a credit memo to a single or multiple vendor ledger entries
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the credit memo that you want to apply.
3. Enter the relevant information in the header.
4. To apply a single vendor ledger entry, on the **Application** FastTab, in the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field, select the entry to apply the credit to, and then, in the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount to apply to the entry.
5. Or, to apply multiple vendor ledger entries:

   1. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
   2. Select the lines with the entries to apply the credit memo to.
   3. Choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action.  
   4. On each line in the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount to apply to the individual entry.

       If you don't enter an amount, then the maximum amount is automatically applied. At the bottom of the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, you can see the amount in the **Applied Amount** field, and you can see whether the application balances.
6. Choose the **OK** button.  
   The **Purchase Credit Memos** page shows the entry that you have selected in the **Applies-to Doc. Type** field and the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field. The page also shows the amount of the credit memo to be posted, adjusted for any payment discounts.
7. Choose the **Post** button to post the purchase credit memo.

## To apply posted vendor ledger entries
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant vendor with entries that have already been posted.
3. Choose the **Ledger Entries** action, and then choose the **Apply Entries** action.
4. On the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, you can see the open entries for the vendor.
5. Select the line with the entry that will be applied.
6. Choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action.

    The **Applies-to ID** field displays three asterisks if you work in a single-user system or your user ID if you work in a multiuser system.  
7. For each line in the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount to apply to the individual entry.

    If you don't enter an amount, then the maximum amount is automatically applied. You can see the amount in the **Applied Amount** field at the bottom of the **Apply Vendor Entries** page.
8. Choose the **Post Application** action.  

    The **Post Application** page opens with the document number of the applying entry and the posting date of the entry with the most recent posting date.
9. Choose the **OK** button to post the application.

## To apply vendor ledger entries in different currencies to one another
If you buy from a vendor in one currency and make payment in another currency, you can still apply the invoice to the payment.

If you apply an entry (Entry 1) in one currency to an entry (Entry 2) in a different currency, the posting date on Entry 1 is used to find the relevant exchange rate to convert amounts on Entry 2. The relevant exchange rate is found on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page. In that case, you must enable application of vendor ledger entries in different currencies. For more information, see [Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies](finance-how-enable-application-ledger-entries-different-currencies.md)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the journal you want, and fill in the first empty journal line using a currency code.
3. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
4. Select the line with the entry you want to apply to the entry in the payment journal, choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action, and then select the entry you want to apply to.
5. Choose the **OK** button to return to the payment journal.
6. Post the payment journal.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   When you apply entries in different currencies to one another, the entries are converted to USD. Even though the exchange rates for the two relevant currencies are fixed, for example between USD and EUR, there may be a small residual amount when these foreign-currency amounts are converted to USD. These small residual amounts are posted as gains and losses to the account specified in the **Realized Gains Account** or **Realized Losses Account** field on the **Currencies** page. The **Amount (USD)** field is also adjusted on the relevant vendor ledger entries.

## To unapply an application of vendor entries
When you unapply an erroneous application, correcting entries that are identical to the original entry but with opposite sign in the amount field is created and posted for all entries, including all general ledger posting derived from the application, such as payment discount and currency gains/losses. The entries that were closed by the application are reopened.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant vendor card.
3. Choose the **Ledger Entries** action.
4. Select the relevant ledger entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
5. Alternatively, choose the **Detailed Ledger Entry** action.
6. Select the application entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
7. Fill in the fields in the header, and then choose the **Unapply** action.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   If an entry has been applied by more than one application entry, you must unapply the latest application entry first.

# Set up intercompany transactions

Intercompany partnerships make it easier to handle accounting processes when two or more subsidiaries of a company frequently do business with each other. Partners can exchange transactions, such as sales and purchases, and handle them either manually or automatically. For example, when a partner sends a sales journal line to another partner, a purchase journal line is created for the receiving partner.

The intercompany chart of accounts can be, for example, a version of the synchronization partner's chart of accounts. Each partner maps their accounts to the intercompany chart of accounts. Each partner also maps their dimensions and dimension values to the intercompany dimensions.

## Before you start

Before you start to set up your intercompany partnership, there are a few decisions to make.

|Decision  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Which chart of accounts should be the basis for the intercompany chart of accounts?     | All companies in the partnership must use the same intercompany chart of accounts. You can base your intercompany chart of accounts on the chart of accounts from one of the companies in the partnership, or create a new intercompany chart of accounts. You map the accounts to use in the partnership in both ways, so that each partner both sends and receives transactions in the correct accounts. Learn more about setting up the intercompany chart of accounts at [Set up the intercompany charts of accounts](#set-up-the-intercompany-charts-of-accounts).         |
|Which dimensions should be the basis for the intercompany dimensions?     | If you use intercompany dimensions, they must be the same for all companies in the partnership. After you specify your intercompany dimensions, map their dimension values. Learn more about mapping dimension values at [Set up intercompany dimensions](#set-up-intercompany-dimensions).        |
|Which partners are customers or vendors, or both?     |  Learn more about setting up customers and vendor companies in an intercompany partnership at [Set up intercompany partners as customers and vendors](#set-up-intercompany-partners-as-customers-and-vendors).       |
|Do you want to specify bank accounts to use in the partnership?| You can speed up the process of registering payment transactions by specifying the bank account to use for each partner company. Learn more at [Specify bank accounts for intercompany partners](#specify-bank-accounts-for-intercompany-partners). |
|How do you want to identify the companies in the partnership?     | All parties must agree on a unique intercompany partner identification code for each company. You assign the code to customer and vendor cards to identify related transactions. Learn more about identifiers at [Create Number Series](ui-create-number-series.md).        |
|How do you want to handle item numbers?     | If intercompany lines contain items, you can either use your own item numbers, or you can set up your partner's item numbers for each item, either in the **Vendor Item No.** field or in the **Common Item No.** field on the item card. You can also use the **Item Reference** action to map your items' numbers to your intercompany partners descriptions of the items. To learn more about item references, go to [Use Item References](inventory-how-use-item-cross-refs.md).        |
|Are resources involved?     | If intercompany sales transactions include resources, fill in the **IC Partner Purch. G/L Acc. No.** field on the resource card for each resource. The field contains the number of the intercompany general ledger account that the amount for this resource posts to in the partner company. To learn more about resources, go to [Set Up Resources](projects-how-setup-resources.md).<br><br>**NOTE**<br>Intercompany purchase transactions that include resources, fixed assets, and item charges aren't fully supported. In the partner company, the **Line Type** field is blank on purchase document lines that include these entities. You must manually update the field.        |

## Overview of the steps to get started

Use the **Intercompany Setup** page to set up the following components of intercompany transactions:

* Your company's intercompany settings.
* The company that is the synchronization partner.
* The intercompany chart of accounts that all partners use to exchange transactions.
* The mappings between accounts in the chart of accounts and intercompany chart of accounts for inbound and outbound transactions for each partner.
* The intercompany dimensions and dimension values to use, and how they're mapped to dimensions for each partner.
* The companies that are the intercompany partners.
* The companies that are vendors or customers, or both.

## Set up a synchronization partner

All partners must use the same intercompany chart of accounts and, if needed, the same intercompany dimensions. You can save time when you set up the partnership by using the chart of accounts and dimensions for one of the partners as a baseline for the intercompany chart of accounts and dimensions. The company that you use as the baseline is called the *synchronization partner*. Typically, the synchronization partner is the headquarter company, but it doesn't have to be.

On the **Intercompany Setup** page, each partner specifies the synchronization partner in the **Synchronization Partner** field. Afterward, the intercompany chart of accounts and intercompany dimensions are automatically specified for them, based on the setup for the synchronization partner. The partners then use the **Intercompany Chart of Accounts Mapping** and **Intercompany Dimension Mapping** pages to map their chart of accounts and dimensions to the intercompany chart of accounts and dimensions, and vice versa. 

> [!NOTE]
> It's important to map accounts and dimensions in both directions. That is, both to the intercompany chart of accounts and dimensions, and from them to your own accounts and dimensions.

### Connect with partners in another tenant or environment

If one or more partners' [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is in another tenant or environment, there are a few extra steps to create the connection. The steps apply to all partners in another tenant or environment.

* Set up [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a registered app in Azure portal.
* Add and enable the app registration in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Exchange information about their intercompany setups. Each partner can get this information from the **Intercompany Setup**, **Actions**, **Connection Details**.

   |Copy from the partner's setup  |Copy to your setup  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Current Connection URL     |IC Partner's Connection URL         |
   |Current Company ID     |IC Partner's Company ID         |
   |Intercompany ID     |IC Partner's Intercompany ID         |
   |Company Name     |IC Partner's Company Name         |

* Exchange the following authentication settings so that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can authenticate when it connects. Each partner can get this information from their registered app. To learn more about how to create a registered app, go to [Create a registered app in Azure portal](#create-a-registered-app-in-azure-portal).  

  * Client ID
  * Client secret
  * Token endpoint
  * Redirect URL

Run the **Intercompany Setup**, **Actions**, **Connection Details** in all companies to specify the information.

#### Create a registered app in Azure portal

This process is only necessary if you want to connect with a partner whose [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is in a different tenant or environment.

> [!TIP]
> It's a good idea to have a text editor open, such as Notepad, while you create your registered app. You'll need some of the information when you run the **Intercompany Setup**, **Actions**, **Connection Details**, so it's nice to have the information handy.

1. Go to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home).
2. Choose the **Microsoft Entra ID** service.
3. In the navigation pane, choose **App registrations**.
4. On the **App registrations** page, choose **new registration**.
5. Give the application a name.
6. Choose the **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID tenant - Multitenant)** account type.
7. For the redirect URI, in the **Select a platform** field, choose **Web**, and then provide the URI. For example, \**https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/OAuthLanding.htm**.

  If you're working with an embed ISV, you might need a different URI.

8. Register the app.
9. On the **Intercompany App** page, on the navigation pane, choose **API permissions**.
10. Choose the **Add a permission** action.
11. On the **Microsoft APIs** tab, choose **Dynamics 365 Business Central**.
12. On the **Request API Permissions** pane, choose **Application permissions**, and then choose the **API.ReadWrite.All** permission.
13. On the **Intercompany App | API permissions** page, choose the **Grant admin consent for Contoso** action, and then grant consent.
14. On the navigation pane, choose **Certificates & secrets**.
15. Choose the **Client secrets** tab, and then choose **New client secret**.
16. On the **Add a client secret** pane, enter a name for the secret, and specify when it expires.

  > [!NOTE]
  > All partners who are in different environments must renew the secret before it expires.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Copy the ID in the **Value** field before you leave the **Intercompany App | Certificates & secrets** page. You'll need it in a later step, and it won't be available after you leave the page. For example, paste the value in a text editor.

17. On the navigation pane, choose **Overview**.
18. Copy the value in the **Application (client) ID** field. For example, paste the value in a text editor.
19. Choose the **Endpoints** action, and then copy the value in the **OAuth 2.0 token endpoint (v2)** field. For example, paste the value in a text editor.
20. Copy the value in the **Directory (tenant) ID** field. For example, paste the value in a text editor.
21. In the token value you copied, replace **organizations** with the value you copied from the **Directory (tenant) ID** field in the previous step.

#### Add and enable your registered app in Business Central

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Microsoft Entra Application Card**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. In the **State** field, choose **Enabled**. 
4. Choose the **Grant Consent** action. 
5. In the **Permission Set** field, choose **D365 INTERCOMPANY CE & DATA ACCESS IC CE** permission sets.

## Set up the intercompany charts of accounts

All partners must use the same intercompany chart of accounts, and map the accounts in their own chart of accounts to it. If the chart of accounts for your company defines the intercompany chart of accounts for your partner companies, follow the steps in this section.

If you're using an XML file that contains the intercompany chart of accounts, follow the steps in [Import or export an intercompany chart of accounts](intercompany-how-setup.md#import-or-export-an-intercompany-chart-of-accounts).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **IC Chart of Accounts** action.
3. To add accounts, do one of the following on the **Intercompany Chart of Accounts** page:
    * Choose **New**, and then enter each account on a line on the page.  
    * If your intercompany chart of accounts is identical or similar to your regular chart of accounts, you can fill on the page automatically by choosing the **Copy from Chart of Accounts** action. You can edit the new lines as needed.
    * If you set up an intercompany chart of accounts for a synchronization partner, use the **Synchronization Setup** action to copy those accounts.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you copy the intercompany chart of accounts from a synchronization partner, you can use the **Synchronization Setup** action to update your intercompany accounts with any changes the partner makes to theirs.

The next step is to map your chart of accounts to the intercompany chart of accounts. Learn more at [Map the intercompany chart of accounts to your company's chart of accounts](#map-the-intercompany-chart-of-accounts-to-your-companys-chart-of-accounts).

### Import or export an intercompany chart of accounts

The synchronization company can share its chart of accounts with partners by exporting it to a file. Partners can import the file to get the chart of accounts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **IC Chart of Accounts** action.
3. On the **Intercompany Chart of Accounts** page, choose the **Import/Export** action, and then choose either **Import** or **Export**.
4. Choose the file to import or export.  

The **Intercompany Chart of Accounts** page is filled with new or edited G/L account lines according to the intercompany chart of accounts in the file. Any existing, unrelated lines on the page remain unchanged.

## Map the intercompany chart of accounts to your company's chart of accounts  

After you define or import the intercompany chart of accounts, map each intercompany account with one of your accounts. On the **Intercompany Chart of Accounts** page, you specify how intercompany G/L accounts on incoming transactions map to G/L accounts from your company's chart of accounts.

If the intercompany accounts and your accounts have the same numbers, you can map the accounts automatically.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **IC Chart of Accounts** action.

    > [!TIP]
    > To access the actions on the page, you might need to expand the page to the wide layout view.

3. On the **Intercompany Chart of Accounts** page, choose the **Chart of Accounts Mapping** action.
4. You can map the accounts manually, or automatically.

    * To manually create the mapping, on the **Intercompany Chart of Account** and **G/L Chart of Accounts** panes, choose an account, and then choose an account in the **G/L No.** and **IC No.** fields.
    * To automatically map accounts that have the same numbers, select the lines that you want to map, choose the **Map to Acc. with Same No** action, and then choose the chart of accounts to update.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to map many or perhaps all accounts, choose a line, choose :::image type="icon" source="media/show-more-options-icon.png" border="false":::, and then choose **Select More**.

## Set up intercompany dimensions

If partners exchange transactions with dimensions linked to them, agree on the dimensions that all of you use. For example, the synchronization company can create a simplified version of their dimensions, export them to an XML file, and then distribute the file to each partner. Each partner can import the XML file on the **Intercompany Dimensions** page and then map the intercompany dimensions to their dimensions. Learn more at [Map intercompany dimensions to your company's dimensions](#map-intercompany-dimensions-to-your-companys-dimensions).

> [!NOTE]
> Each company must map their dimensions to the intercompany dimensions for outgoing documents and incoming documents. Mapping accounts in both directions is important, and helps maintain consistency across the companies.

If partners use the synchronization partner's intercompany dimensions, follow the steps in this section. If you want to share using an XML file that contains the intercompany dimensions, follow the steps in [Import or export intercompany dimensions](#import-or-export-intercompany-dimensions).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **IC Dimensions** action.
3. To add dimensions, do one of the following on the **Intercompany Dimensions** page:
    * Choose **New**, and then enter each dimension on a line.  
    * If your intercompany dimensions are identical or similar to your regular dimensions, you can fill on the page automatically by choosing the **Copy from Dimensions** action. Afterward, you can edit the lines as needed.
    * If you specify intercompany dimensions for a synchronization partner, use the **Synchronization Setup** action to copy those dimensions.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you copy the intercompany dimensions from a synchronization partner, you can use the **Synchronization Setup** action to update your intercompany dimensions with any changes the partner makes to theirs.  

### Import or export intercompany dimensions  

The synchronization company can share its dimensions with partners by exporting them to a file. Partners can import the file to get the dimensions.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **IC Dimensions** action.  
3. On the **Intercompany Dimensions** page, choose the **Import/Export** action, and then choose either **Import** or **Export**.
4. Choose the file to import or export.

The next step is to map the dimensions with the intercompany dimensions. Learn more at [Map intercompany dimensions to your company's dimensions](#map-intercompany-dimensions-to-your-companys-dimensions).

### Map intercompany dimensions to your company's dimensions

After you specify the dimensions you use, map each intercompany dimension with one of your company's dimensions, and vice versa. Use the **Intercompany Dimensions Mapping** page to specify the mapping. Afterward, repeat the process for the dimension values.

* Specify how intercompany dimensions on incoming transactions map to dimensions from your company's list of dimensions.
* Specify how your dimensions translate to intercompany dimensions on *outgoing transactions*.

If any of the intercompany dimensions have the same code as the corresponding dimensions in your company, you can automatically map the dimensions.  

In the following steps, you first map intercompany dimensions to dimensions for incoming documents in the **Intercompany Dimensions** pane. Then, you map dimensions to intercompany dimensions for outgoing documents on the **Current Company Dimensions** pane.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **IC Dimensions** action.
3. On the **Intercompany Dimensions** page, choose the **Dimensions Mapping** action.
4. You can map the dimensions manually, or automatically.

    * To manually create the mapping, on the **Intercompany Dimensions** and **Current Company Dimensions** panes, choose a dimension, and then choose a dimension in the **Dim. Code** and **IC Dim. Code** fields.
    * To automatically map dimensions that have the same code, select the lines that you want to map, choose the **Map dimensions with same code** action, and then choose the dimensions to update. 

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to map many or perhaps all dimensions, choose a line, choose :::image type="icon" source="media/show-more-options-icon.png" border="false":::, and then choose **Select More**.

5. Choose the **Dimension Values Mapping** action.
6. On the **Intercompany Dimension Values Mapping** page, the steps to create the mapping are similar to what you just did for dimensions.

## Set up intercompany general journal templates and batches

You must set up a general journal template and a general journal batch to use by default for intercompany transactions. The template and batch are especially important if you automatically accept intercompany transactions from your partners. To learn more about autoaccepting transactions, go to [Autoaccept transactions from intercompany partners](#autoaccept-transactions-from-intercompany-partners).

* General journals are used to post to general ledger accounts and other accounts, such as bank, customer, and vendor accounts. Posting with a general journal always creates entries on general ledger accounts. Use the **Intercompany General Journal** page to set up the general journal batch to use. The settings that are specific to intercompany transactions are the accounts you specify in the **IC Account Type** and **IC Account No** fields.
* Journal templates give you a journal page designed for a specific purpose. That is, the fields in journal templates are exactly the ones needed for a particular part of the program. Use the **General Journal Templates** page to set up a template to use for intercompany transactions.

To learn more about general journal templates and batches, go to [Use journal templates and batches](ui-work-general-journals.md#use-journal-templates-and-batches).

## Set up a company for intercompany transactions

The following steps assume that a synchronization partner is set up with the chart of accounts and dimensions on which you base the intercompany chart of accounts and dimensions. You can set them up yourself, but it's typically faster to get started, and maintenance is easier, to you use a synchronization partner. To learn more about the synchronization partner, go to [Set up a synchronization partner](#set-up-a-synchronization-partner).

> [!TIP]
> It's a good idea to fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab on the **Intercompany Setup** page for each partner before you add their partners. When you add partner companies that are in the same tenant, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gets their IC code and company name from their setup on the General FastTab. The **Company Name** field will verify that their IC code is unique.

> [!NOTE]
> If you'll use a synchronization partner, leave the **Synchronization Partner** field blank when you set that company up for the partnership.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intercompany Setup** page, fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can't use file locations to transfer transactions to your partners because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can't access your local network. Therefore, if you choose **File Location** in the **Transfer Type** field, the **Folder Path** field is not available. Instead, the file will be downloaded to the **Downloads** folder on your computer. You then send the file to someone in the partner company, for example, by email. For a more direct process, we recommend that you choose **Email**.

The next step is to set up the partner companies.

## Set up intercompany partners

Each partner must add all other companies in the partnership as a partner.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Intercompany Partners** FastTab, choose **Add**.
3. In the **Transfer Type** field, specify how you send data to the partner.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **File Location** option works only for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

4. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all companies in the partnership.

> [!NOTE]
> For intercompany posting, if you turn on the **Auto. Accept Transaction** toggle on the **Intercompany Partner** page [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suppresses messages that warn about purchase invoices duplicating the original purchase order. It's important to have a business process for managing duplicates. For example, by deleting such purchase orders when the purchase invoice is received from the intercompany partner.

### Set up intercompany partners as customers and vendors

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Intercompany Partners** FastTab, open the card page for the partner.
3. Depending on what you want to do, choose the customer or partner in the **Customer No.** or **Vendor No.** fields.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the customer or vendor hasn't been created, you can choose **+New** in the drop-down menu to set them up. To learn more about creating customers and vendors, go to [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md) and [Register New Vendors](purchasing-how-register-new-vendors.md).

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also specify a customer or vendor as an intercompany partner by filling in the **IC Partner Code** field on the **Customer Card** and **Vendor Card** pages.

### Set up default intercompany partner general ledger accounts  

On the **G/L Account Card** page, for accounts that you regularly use on outgoing intercompany sales or purchase lines, you can specify a default intercompany partner general ledger account. For example, for your receivables accounts, you can enter the corresponding payables accounts from the intercompany chart of accounts. The receivables and payables accounts are used as the off-setting account for the intercompany partner when you post transactions on intercompany general journals.  

Then, when you enter a general ledger account in the **Bal. Account No.** field on an intercompany line with **Intercompany Partner** in the **Account Type** field, the **IC Partner G/L Account** field is automatically filled in.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the G/L account that's used for intercompany transactions, and in the **Default IC Partner G/L Account** field, enter the intercompany general ledger account that your partner post to when you post to the general ledger account on the line.
3. Repeat step 2 for each account that you often enter in the **Bal. Account No.** field on a line in an intercompany journal or document.

### Autoaccept transactions from intercompany partners

To make it faster to process intercompany transactions, you can specify that you want to automatically create journal lines based on an intercompany partner's posts from the **IC General Journal** page. To autocreate incoming and outgoing transactions, you must turn on the following toggles for each partner:

* On the **Intercompany Setup** page, turn on the **Auto. Send Transactions** toggle for the synchronization partner. Then specify where to create received intercompany journal transactions by filling in the **Default IC Gen. Jnl. Template** and **Default IC Gen. Jnl. Batch** fields.

    > [!TIP]
    > If the **Default IC Gen. Jnl. Template** field is blank, you need to set up a general journal template to use for your intercompany general journals. To learn more about templates and batches, go to [Set up intercompany general journal templates and batches](#set-up-intercompany-general-journal-templates-and-batches)    

* On the **Intercompany Partner** page, turn on the **Auto Accept Transactions** toggle.

The journal lines are created for you, but not posted.

### Specify bank accounts for intercompany partners

To facilitate fast payments, specify one or more bank accounts to use for intercompany partners. When a partner uses an intercompany general journal to make a payment, they can specify the bank account on the line. The bank account is used as the balancing account in the receiving company, which minimizes the need to manually enter transactions.

* To specify the bank account to use, on the **Intercompany Partners** page, choose the **Bank Accounts** action. On the **Intercompany Bank Account Card**, enter the account information.

## Troubleshoot your intercompany setup

On the **Intercompany Setup** page, the **Intercompany Setup Diagnostics** pane contains tiles that indicate whether all of the components needed to exchange intercompany transactions are set up. The tiles are also available on the Business Manager Role Center. Choose the tiles to find out what's missing. For an overview of the required components, go to [Overview of the steps to get started](#overview-of-the-steps-to-get-started).

# Depreciation methods for fixed assets

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports eight different methods of depreciation for fixed assets:

* Straight-Line (SL)
* Declining-Balance 1 (DB1)
* Declining-Balance 2 (DB2)
* DB1/SL
* DB2/SL
* Half-Year Convention
* Manual
* User-defined depreciation

## Straight-Line depreciation

With Straight-Line depreciation, you deprecate the asset value either with a fixed yearly percentage or with a fixed yearly amount over the depreciation period. When you use the straight-line method, you must specify one of the following options in the fixed asset depreciation book:  

* The depreciation period (years or months) or a depreciation ending date  
* A fixed yearly percentage  
* A fixed yearly amount  
* Depreciation period  

### Depreciation period

If you enter the depreciation period (the number of depreciation years, the number of depreciation months, or the depreciation ending date), the following formula calculates the depreciation amount:  

* Depreciation Amount = ((Book value - Salvage Value) x Number of Depreciation Days) / Remaining Depreciation Days*  

The remaining depreciation days are calculated as the number of depreciation days minus the number of days between the depreciation starting date and the last fixed asset entry date.  

Book value can be reduced by posted appreciation, write-down, custom 1, or custom 2 amounts depending on whether the **Include in Depr. Calculation** field is deactivated and whether the **Part of Book Value** field is activated on the **FA Posting Type Setup** page. This calculation ensures that the fixed asset is fully depreciated at the depreciation ending date.  

### Fixed yearly percentage

If you enter a fixed yearly percentage, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the following formula to calculate the depreciation amount:  

* Depreciation Amount = (Straight-Line % x Depreciable Basis x Number of Depr. Days) / (100 x 360)*  

### Fixed yearly amount

If you enter a fixed yearly amount, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the following formula to calculate the depreciation amount:  

* Depreciation Amount = (Fixed Depreciation Amount x Number of Depreciation Days) / 360*  

### Example - Straight-Line depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The estimated life is eight years. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run biannually.  

For this example, the fixed asset ledger entry looks like this:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| ---- | --------------- | ---- | ------ | ---------- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 06/30/20 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |93,750.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |87,500.00 |
| 06/30/21 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |81,250.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |75,000.00 |
| ...      |             |    |          |          |
| 06/30/27 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |6,250.00  |
| 12/31/27 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |0         |

## Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

This depreciation method allocates the largest part of an asset's cost to the early years of its useful lifetime. If you use this method, you must enter a fixed yearly percentage.  

The following formula calculates depreciation amounts:  

* Depreciation Amount = (Declining-Bal. % x Number of Depreciation Days x Depr. Basis) / (100 x 360)*  

The depreciable basis is calculated as the book value at the beginning of the year. The number of depreciation days are the number of days between the posting date and the last depreciation date. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates depreciation assuming that any depreciation done in the fiscal year is done with this formula.  

The posted depreciation amount can contain entries with various posting types (write-down, custom1, and custom2) posted since the starting date of the current fiscal year. These posting types are included in the posted depreciation amount if there are check marks in the **Depreciation Type** and the **Part of Book Value** fields on the **FA Posting Type Setup** page.  

### Example 1 - Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The **Declining-Balance %** field is 25. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run biannually.  

The following table shows how the fixed asset ledger entries look.  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| ---- | --------------- | ---- | ------ | ---------- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Costs |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 06/30/20 |Depreciation |180 |-12,500.00 |87,500.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |180 |-12,500.00 |75,000.00 |
| 06/30/21 |Depreciation |180 |-9,375.00 |65,625.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |180 |-9,375.00 |56,250.00 |
| 06/30/22 |Depreciation |180 |-7,031.25 |49,218.75 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |180 |-7,031.25 |42,187.50 |
| 06/30/23 |Depreciation |180 |-5,273.44 |36,914.06 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |180 |-5,273.44 |31,640.62 |
| 06/30/24 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |27,685.54 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |23,730.46 |
| ...      |             |    |          |          |

Calculation method:  

* Year 1: *25% of 100,000 = 25,000 = 12,500 + 12,500*
* Year 2: *25% of 75,000 = 18,750 = 9,375 + 9,375*
* Year 3: *25% of 56,250 = 14,062.50 = 7,031.25 + 7,031.25*
* ...

The calculation continues until the book value equals the final rounding amount or the salvage value that you entered.  

### Example 2 - Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

An asset's book value is 100,000 on 12/31/2022. You post a depreciation of 1,778 on 2/2/23, which is the expected (proportional) amount of the year's depreciation at 32 days. If you run depreciation on 6/30/2023 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest 8,222, because there are 148 days from 2/2/2023 until 6/30/2023. The expected remaining depreciation for 6/30/2023 is calculated using the following formula:

* *148/360 x 0.20 x 100,000 = 8,222*

### Example 3 - Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

If you post an amount that doesn't align with the Declining Balance 1 depreciation method, for example, 5,000, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests the remainder of the expected amount.

An asset's book value is 100,000 on 12/31/2022. You post a depreciation of 5,000 on 2/2/2023, which is more than the expected (proportional) amount on 2/2/2023 at 32 days. If you run depreciation on 6/30/2023, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest 8,222, because there are 148 days from 2/2/2023 until 6/30/2023. The expected remaining depreciation for 6/30/2023 is calculated using the following formula:

* *148/360 x 0.20 x 100,000 = 8,222*

### Example 4 - Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

An asset's book value is 100,000 on 12/31/2023. You post a depreciation of 95,000 on 2/2/2023, which exceeds the allowed depreciation amount for the year. If you run depreciation on 6/30/2023, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest 5000, because there are 148 days from 2/2/2023 until 6/30/2023. The expected remaining depreciation for 6/30/2023 is calculated using the following formula: 

* *148/360 x 0.20 x 100,000 = 8,222*

However, the remaining book value is only 5,000, so [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest 5,000 because a book value can't be negative.

## Declining-Balance 2 depreciation

The Declining-Balance 1 and Declining-Balance 2 methods calculate the same total depreciation amount for each year. However, if you run the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job more than once a year, the Declining-Balance 1 method results in equal depreciation amounts for each depreciation period. The Declining-Balance 2 method, on the other hand, results in depreciation amounts that decline for each period.  

### Example - Declining-Balance 2 depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The **Declining-Balance %** field is 25. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run biannually. The fixed asset ledger entries look like this:  

| Date     | FA Posting Type  | Days                       | Amount    | Book Value |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------------------  | --------- | ---------- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Costs |(Depreciation starting date)|100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 06/30/20 |Depreciation      |180                         |-13,397.46 | 86,602.54 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation      |180                         |-11,602.54 | 75,000.00 |
| 06/30/21 |Depreciation      |180                         |-10,048.09 | 64,951.91 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation      |180                         |-8,701.91  | 56,250.00 |
| ...      |                  |                            |           |           |

Calculation Method:  

* *BV* = Book value  
* *ND* = Number of depreciation days  
* *DBP* = Declining-balance percent  
* *P* = *DBP*/100  
* *D* = *ND*/360  

The formula to calculate the depreciation amounts is:  

* *DA* = *BV* x (1 – (1 –P)<sup>D</sup>)

The depreciation values are:  

| Date     | Calculation                                                |
| -------- | -----------                                                |
| 06/30/20 |DA = 100,000.00 x (1 -(1 - 0.25)<sup>0.5</sup>) = 13,397.46 |
| 12/31/20 |DA = 86,602.54 x (1 - (1 - 0.25)<sup>0.5</sup>) = 11,602.54 |
| 06/30/21 |DA = 75,000.00 x (1 - (1 - 0.25)<sup>0.5</sup>) = 10,048.09 |
| 12/31/21 |DA = 64,951.91 x (1 - (1 - 0.25)<sup>0.5</sup>) = 8,701.91  |
| ...      |                                                            |

## DB1/SL depreciation

DB1/SL is an abbreviated combination of Declining-Balance 1 and Straight-Line. The calculation continues until the book value equals the final rounding amount, or the salvage value that you entered.  

The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job calculates a straight-line amount and a declining balance amount, but only the greater of the two amounts are transferred to the journal.  

You can use various percentages to calculate declining-balance.  

If you use this method, you must enter the estimated useful lifetime and a declining balance percentage on the **FA Depreciation Books** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you use any of the declining balance depreciation methods, and you want to run depreciation for multiple years, you must run each year's depreciation separately. If you run depreciation for the whole period from acquisition date to the end of the last fiscal year or last accounting period, it's likely that the results will be incorrect. For example, you might want to run it for multiple years if you have imported legacy data and you use the actual acquisition dates for your assets and want to catch up on accumulated depreciation. For declining balance methods, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the allowed depreciation per year, starting with the registered book value for each year. It can't do a multi-year depreciation in one step.
>
> The **Fixed asset - Projected Value** report can project depreciations for multi-year periods, which might be confusing compared to the results you get if you run depreciations for multiple years using one of the declining balance methods. 

### Example - DB1-SL depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. On the **FA Depreciation Books** page, the **Declining-Balance %** field contains 25 and the **No. of Depreciation Years** field contains **8**. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run biannually.  

The fixed asset ledger entries look like this:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Costs |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 06/30/20 |Depreciation |180 |-12,500.00 |87,500.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |180 |-12,500.00 |75,000.00 |
| 06/30/21 |Depreciation |180 |-9,375.00 |65,625.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |180 |-9,375.00 |56,250.00 |
| 06/30/22 |Depreciation |180 |-7,031.25 |49,218.75 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |180 |-7,031.25 |42,187.50 |
| 06/30/23 |Depreciation |180 |-5,273.44 |36,914.06 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |180 |-5,273.44 |31,640.62 |
| 06/30/24 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |27,685.54 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |23,730.46 |
| 06/30/25 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |19,775.38 SL |
| 12/31/25 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |15,820.30 SL |
| 06/30/26 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |11,865.22 SL |
| 12/31/26 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.07 |7,910.15 SL |
| 06/30/27 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |3,955.07 SL |
| 12/31/27 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.07 |0.00 SL |

`SL` after the book value means that the straight-line method was used.  

Calculation method:  

* Year 1 (2020):  

    *Declining-balance amount: 25% of 100,000 = 25,000 = 12,500 + 12,500*  

    *Straight-line amount = 100,000 / 8 = 12,500 = 6,250 + 6,250*  

    The declining-balance amount is used because it's the greater amount.  
* ...
* Year 5 (2025):  

    *Declining-balance amount: 25% of 23,730.46 = 4,943.85= 2,471.92 + 2,471.92*  

    *Straight-line amount = 23,730.46/3 = 7,910.15 = 3,995.07 + 3,995.08*  

    The straight-line amount is used because it's the greater amount.  

## Half-Year Convention depreciation

The Half-Year Convention method is only applied if you turn on the **Use Half-Year Convention** toggle for the fixed asset on the **Fixed Asset Card** page.  

You can use this depreciation method with the following depreciation methods:  

* Straight-Line  
* Declining-Balance 1  
* DB1/SL  

When you apply the Half-Year Convention method, a fixed asset has six months of depreciation in the first fiscal year, regardless of the contents of the **Depreciation Starting Date** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The estimated life of the fixed asset that is remaining after the first fiscal year will always contain a half-year using the Half-Year Convention Method. Thus, for the Half-Year Convention method to be applied correctly, the **Depreciation Ending Date** field on the **FA Depreciation Book** page must always contain a date which is exactly six months before the final date of the fiscal year in which the fixed asset will fully depreciate.  

### Example - Half-Year Convention depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The **Depreciation Starting Date** is 03/01/20. The estimated life is five years, so the **Depreciation Ending Date** must be 06/30/25. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run annually. This example is based on a calendar fiscal year.  

The fixed asset ledger entries look like this:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 03/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |270 |-10,000.00 |90,000.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |360 |-20,000.00 |70,000.00 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |360 |-20,000.00 |50,000.00 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |360 |-20,000.00 |30,000.00 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |360 |-20,000.00 |10,000.00 |
| 12/31/25 |Depreciation |180 |-10,000.00 |0.00 |

## Example - DB1/SL depreciation using Half-Year Convention

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The **Depreciation Starting Date** is 11/01/20. The estimated life is five years, so the **Depreciation Ending Date** must be 06/30/25. On the **FA Depreciation Books** page, the **Declining-Balance %** field contains 40. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run annually. This example is based on a calendar fiscal year.  

The fixed asset ledger entries look like this:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 11/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |60 |-20,000.00 |80,000.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |360 |-32,000.00 |48,000.00 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |360 |-19,200.00 |28,800.00 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |360 |-11,520.00 |17,280.00 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |360 |-11,520.00 |5,760.00 SL |
| 12/31/25 |Depreciation |180 |-5,760.00 |0.00 SL |

`SL` after the book value means that the straight-line method was used.  

Calculation method:  

* Year 1:  

    *Declining-balance amount = Full year amount = 40% of 100,000 = 40,000.* Thus, for half a year 40,000 / 2 = 20,000  

    *Straight-line amount = Full year amount = 100,000 / 5 = 20,000.* Thus, for half a year = 20,000 / 2 = 10,000  

    The declining-balance amount is used because it's the greater amount.  
* ...
* Year 5 (2024):  

    *Declining-balance amount = 40% of 17,280.00 = 6,912.00*  

    *Straight-line amount = 28,800 / 1.5 = 11,520.00*  

    The straight-line amount is used because it's the greater amount.  

## Duplicate entries to other depreciation books

If you have three depreciation books, B1, B2 and B3, and you want to duplicate entries from B1 to B2 and B3, you can turn on the **Part of Duplication List** toggle on the depreciation book cards for B2 and B3. For example, this setting can be useful in the following situations:

* Depreciation book B1 integrates with the general ledger and uses the fixed asset G/L journal.
* Depreciation books B2 and B3 don't integrate with the general ledger and use the fixed asset journal.  

When you make an entry in B1 in the fixed asset G/L journal, and turn on the **Part of Duplication List** toggle, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] duplicates the entry in book B2 and B3 in the fixed asset journal when you post the entry.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't duplicate in the same journal and journal batch as you're duplicating from. If you post entries in the fixed asset G/L journal, you can duplicate them in the fixed asset journal or in the fixed asset G/L journal using another batch.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't use the same number series in the fixed asset G/L journal and the fixed asset journal. When you post entries in the fixed asset G/L journal, you must leave the **Document No.** field empty. If you enter a number in the field, the number is duplicated in the fixed asset journal. You'll have to manually change the document number before you can post the journal.  

## Manual depreciation

Use the manual method for assets that aren't subject to depreciation, for example, land. You must enter depreciation in the fixed asset G/L journal. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job omits fixed assets that use the manual depreciation method.

## User-defined depreciation

If the built-in depreciation methods don't meet your needs, you can define your own depreciation method by using depreciation tables. To learn more about applying a user-defined depreciation method, go to [Set Up User-Defined Depreciation Method](fa-how-setup-user-defined-depreciation-method.md).

# Walkthrough: Planning supplies automatically

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

Phrases like "run planning" and "run MRP" refer to the calculation of the master production schedule (MPS) and the material requirements plan (MRP) based on actual and forecasted demand.  

-   MPS is the calculation of a master production schedule based on actual demand and the demand forecast. The MPS calculation is used for end items that have a forecast or a sales order line. These items are called "MPS items" and are identified dynamically when the calculation starts.  
-   MRP is the calculation of material requirements based on actual demand for components and the demand forecast on the component level. MRP is calculated only for items that aren't MPS items. The overall purpose of MRP is to provide time-phased formal plans, by item, to supply the right item at the right time, in the right place, in the right quantity.  

 The planning algorithms used for both MPS and MRP are identical. The planning algorithms use netting, reuse of existing supply orders, and action messages. The planning system process examines what is needed or will be needed (demand) and what is available or expected (supply). When these quantities are netted against each other, action messages are displayed in the planning worksheet. Action messages are suggestions to create a new supply order, change a supply order (quantity or date), or cancel an existing supply order. Supply orders can be production orders, purchase orders, and transfer orders. For more information, see [Design Details: Supply Planning](design-details-supply-planning.md).  

 The planning result is calculated partly from the demand-supply sets in the database and partly by the setup of stockkeeping unit cards or item cards, production BOMs, and routings.  

## About this walkthrough  
 This walkthrough demonstrates how to use the supply planning system to automatically plan all the purchase and production orders required to produce 15 touring bicycles demanded on different sales orders. To provide a clear and realistic walkthrough, the number of planning lines is delimited by filtering out all other demand-supply sets in the CRONUS demonstration company except the sales demand at location EAST.  

 This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

-   Creating the sales order and calculating a complete supply plan.  
-   Viewing planning parameters and order tracking entries behind the planning lines.  
-   Automatically creating the suggested supply orders.  
-   Creating new sales demand and replanning accordingly.  

## Roles  

-   Production Planner  
-   Purchasing Agent  

## Prerequisites  
 To complete this walkthrough, you need:  

-   The CRONUS International Ltd. demonstration company.  
-   To change various item setup values by following the steps in the "Preparing Sample Data" section, later in this walkthrough.  

## Story  
 The customer, Cannon Group PLC, orders five touring bikes for shipment on 02-05-2021 (February 5).  

 Eduardo, the production planner, performs the routine supply planning for the first week of February 2021. Eduardo filters on their own location, EAST, and enters a planning interval of the work date (01-23-2021) to 02-07-2021 before calculating an initial supply plan.  

 The only demand that week is for the Cannon Group sales order. Eduardo sees that none of the planning lines have warnings, and proceeds to create supply orders without changes for the suggested planning lines.  

 The next day, before any of the initial supply orders are started or posted, Eduardo is notified when another customer orders ten touring bikes for shipment on 02-12-2021. Eduardo recalculates to adjust the supply plan according to the change of demand. The recalculation gives you a net change plan that suggests changes to both time and quantity of some of the supply orders created in the first run.  

 During the various planning steps, Eduardo looks up the involved orders, and uses the Order Tracking feature to see which demand is covered by which supply.  

## Preparing sample data  
 Create stockkeeping units (SKUs) for the touring bike and a selection of its components, item numbers 1001 to 1300. (Some components are excluded to simplify the procedures.) Adjust the planning parameters of the selected components to provide a more transparent planning result.  

### To create stockkeeping units  

1.  Open the item card for item 1001, Touring Bicycle.  
2.  Choose the **Create Stockkeeping Unit** action.  
3.  On the **Create Stockkeeping Unit** page, leave all options and filters unchanged, and then choose the **OK** button.  
4.  Repeat steps 1 through 3 for all items in the number range between 1100 and 1300.  

### To change selected planning parameters  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Stockkeeping Units**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the EAST stockkeeping unit card for item 1100, Front Wheel.  
3.  On the **Planning** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Reordering Policy|Safety Stock Quantity|Lot Accumulation Period|Rescheduling Period|  
    |-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|  
    |Lot-for-Lot|Blank|2W|2W|  

4.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all SKUs in the number range between 1100 and 1300.  

 This completes the preparation of sample data for the walkthrough.  

## Creating a regenerative supply plan  
 In reaction to a new sales order for five touring bikes, Ricardo begins the planning process by setting options, filters, and planning interval to exclude all other demand except that of the first week of February at location EAST. Ricardo begins by calculating a master production schedule (MPS), and then proceeds to calculate a complete supply plan for all lower-level demand (MRP).  

### To create the sales order  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  On the **Sales Order** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Sell-to Customer Name|Shipment Date|Item No.|Location|Quantity|  
    |----------------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|  
    |Cannon Group|02-05-2014|1001|EAST|5|  

4.  Accept the availability warning and choose the **Yes** button to record the new demand quantity.  

### To create a regenerative plan to fulfill demand at location EAST  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planning Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Calculate Regenerative Plan** action.  
3.  On the **Calculate Plan - Plan. Wksh.** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Calculate Plan|Starting Date|Ending Date|Show results:|Limit totals to|  
    |--------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|  
    |**MPS** = Yes<br /><br /> **MRP** = No|01-23-2021<br /><br /> (work date)|02-07-2021|1001..1300|Location Filter = EAST|  

4.  Choose the **OK** button to start the planning run.  

     One planning line is created suggesting that a planned production order is issued to produce the ten touring bikes, item 1001, by 02-05-2021, the shipment date of the sales order.  

     Next, verify that this planning line relates to the Cannon Group sales order by using the **Order Tracking** function, which dynamically links demand with its planned supply.  

5.  Select the new planning line, and then choose the **Order Tracking** action.  
6.  On the **Order Tracking** page, choose the **Show** action.  

     The sales order for five touring bikes shipping to customer number 10000 on 02-05-2021 is shown.  

7.  Close the **Sales Order** and **Order Tracking** pages.  

### To calculate MRP to include underlying component needs  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planning Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Calculate Regenerative Plan** action.  
3.  On the **Calculate Plan - Plan. Wksh.** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Calculate|Starting Date|Ending Date|Show results:|Limit totals to:|  
    |---------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|  
    |**MPS** = Yes<br /><br /> **MRP** = Yes|01-23-2021|02-07-2021|1001..1300|Location Filter = EAST|  

4.  Choose the **OK** button to start the planning run.  

     A total of 14 planning lines are created suggesting supply orders for all the demand that the touring bike sales order at EAST location represents.  

## Analyze the planning result  
 To analyze the suggested quantities, Eduardo drills down on selected planning lines to view order tracking entries and planning parameters.  

 On the **Planning Worksheet** page, note in the **Due Date** column that the suggested supply orders are scheduled backward from the due date of the sales order, 02-05-2021. The timeline begins on the top planning line with the production order to produce the finished touring bikes. The timeline ends on the bottom planning line with the purchase order for one of the lowest-level items, 1255, Socket Back, due on 01-30-2021. Like the planning line for item 1251, Axle Back Wheel, this line represents a purchase order for components that are due on the starting date of its produced parent, subassembly item 1250, which in turn is due on 02-03-2014. Throughout the worksheet, you can see that all underlying items are due on the starting date of their parents.  

 The planning line for item 1300, Chain Assy, suggests ten pieces. This deviates from the five pieces that we expect to need to fulfill the sales order. Proceed to view the order tracking entries.  

### To view order tracking entries for item 1300  

1.  Select the planning line for item 1300, and then choose the **Order Tracking** action.  

     The two lines on the **Order Tracking** page show that five pieces are tracked from the planning line (first order tracking line) to sales order 1001 (second order tracking line). The last five pieces suggested on the planning line aren't related to any document lines, but to a planning parameter, forecast entry, or blanket order entry. Such untracked quantities are summed in the **Untracked Quantity** field in the header of the **Order Tracking** page.  

2.  Choose the **Untracked Quantity** field.  

     The **Untracked Planning Elements** page shows that item 1300 uses a planning parameter, Minimum Order Quantity, of 10.00. Therefore, the planning line is for ten pieces in total, of which only five can be tracked to a demand. The last five pieces are an untracked quantity to satisfy the planning parameter. Proceed to review the planning parameter.  

### To check the planning parameter  

1.  On the **Untracked Planning Elements** page, select the order tracking line for item 1300.  
2.  Choose the **Item No.** field, and then choose the **Advanced** action.  
3.  On the **Item List** page, choose the **Stockkeeping Units** action.  
4.  On the **Stockkeeping Unit List** page, open the EAST stockkeeping unit card.  
5.  On the **Planning** FastTab, note that the **Minimum Order Quantity** field contains 10.  
6.  Close all pages except the **Planning Worksheet** page.  

### To view more order tracking entries  

1.  Select the planning line for item 1110, Rim, and then choose the **Order Tracking** action.  

     The **Order Tracking** page shows that five rims are needed for each production order for front and back wheels respectively.  

     The same order tracking applies to the planning lines for items 1120, 1160, and 1170. For item 1120, the **Quantity per** field on the production BOM of each wheel item is 50 PCS, which results in a total need of 100.  

     The planning line for item 1150 for six pieces looks irregular. Proceed to analyze.  

2.  Select the planning line for item 1150, and then, on then choose the **Order Tracking** action.  

     The **Order Tracking** page shows that five units are tracked to the front wheel, and one unit is untracked. Proceed to view the untracked quantity.  

3.  Choose the **Untracked Quantity** field.  

     The **Untracked Planning Elements** page shows that item 1150 uses a planning parameter, Order Multiple, of 2.00, which specifies that when the item is ordered, it must be in a quantity that is divisible by 2. The closest number to 5 that is divisible by 2 is 6.  

     The same order tracking applies to the planning lines for the Front Hub components, items 1151 and 1155, except that each need is multiplied by the scrap percentage that is defined for item 1150 in the **Scrap Percentage** field on the item card.  

 This completes the analysis of the initial supply plan. Notice that the **Accept Action Message** check box is selected in all planning lines indicating that they're ready to be converted to supply orders.  

## Carrying out action messages  
 Next, Eduardo converts the suggested planning lines to supply orders by using the **Carry Out Action Msg.** function.  

### To automatically create the suggested supply orders  

1.  Select the **Accept Action Message** check box on all planning lines with a warning of type Exception.  
2.  Choose the **Carry Out Action Message** action.  
3.  On the **Carry Out Action Msg.-Plan.** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Production Order|Purchase Order|Transfer Order|  
    |----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|  
    |Firm Planned|Make Purch. Orders|Make Trans. Orders|  

4.  Choose the **OK** button to automatically create all the suggested supply orders.  
5.  Close the empty **Planning Worksheet** page.  

 This completes the initial calculation, analysis, and creation of a supply plan for demand at location EAST in the first week of February. In the following section, another customer orders ten touring bikes, and Eduardo must replan.  

## Creating a net change plan  
 The next day, before any supply orders are started or posted, a new sales order arrives from Libros S.A. for ten touring bikes to be shipped on 02-12-2021. Eduardo is notified of the new demand, and proceeds to replan in order to adjust the current supply plan. Eduardo uses the Net Change Plan function to calculate only the changes that are made to demand or supply since the last planning run. In addition, Eduardo expands the planning period to 02-14-2021 to include the new sales demand on 02-12-2014.  

 The planning system calculates the best way to cover the demand for these two identical products, such as to consolidate some purchase and production orders, reschedule other orders, and create new orders where it's required.  

### To create the new sales, demand and replan accordingly  

1.  Choose the **New** action.  
2.  On the **Sales Order** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Sell-to Customer Name|Shipment Date|Item No.|Location|Quantity|  
    |----------------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|  
    |Libros S.A.|02-12-2021|1001|EAST|10|  

3.  Accept the availability warning and choose the **Yes** button to record the demand quantity.  
4.  Proceed to replan to adjust the current supply plan.  
5.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planning Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
6.  Choose the **Calculate Net Change Plan** action.  
7.  On the **Calculate Plan - Plan. Wksh.** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Calculate Plan|Starting Date|Ending Date|Show results:|Limit totals to|  
    |--------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|  
    |**MPS** = Yes<br /><br /> **MRP** = Yes|01-23-2021|02-14-2021|1001..1300|Location Filter = EAST|  

8.  Choose the **OK** button to start the planning run.  

 A total of 14 planning lines are created. Notice in the first planning line that the **Action Message** field contains **New**, the **Quantity** field 10, and the **Due Date** field 02-12-21. This new line for the top parent item, 1001, Touring Bike, is created because the item uses a reordering policy of **Order**, which means that it must be supplied in a one-to-one relationship to its demand, the sales order of ten pieces.  

 The next two planning lines are the production orders for touring bike wheels. Each existing order of five, in the **Original Quantity** field, is increased to 15, in the **Quantity** field. Both production orders have unchanged due dates, as indicated in the **Action Message** field that contains **Change Qty.** This is also the case for the planning line for item 1300, except its order multiple of 10.00 rounds the tracked demand for 15 pieces up to the 20.  

 All other planning lines have an action message of **Resched. & Chg. Qty.**. This means that apart from being increased in quantity, the due dates are moved in relation to the supply plan to include the extra quantity in the available production time (capacity). Purchased components are rescheduled and increased to supply the production orders. Proceed to analyze the new plan.  

## Analyze the changed planning result  
 Because all lot-for-lot-planned items within the filter, 1100 to 1300, have a rescheduling period of two weeks, their existing supply orders are all modified to meet the new demand, which occurs within the specified two weeks.  

 Several planning lines are multiplied by three to provide 15 touring bikes instead of 5, and the due dates are moved back in time to provide the increased quantities by the shipment date of the sales order to the Cannon Group. For these planning lines, all quantities can be tracked. The remaining planning lines are increased by ten pieces in addition to moving their due dates. For these planning lines, a part of the quantities are untracked due to different planning parameters. Proceed to view some of these order tracking entries.  

### To view order tracking entries for item 1250  

1.  Select the planning line for item 1250, and then choose the **Order Tracking** action.  

     The seven lines on the **Order Tracking** page show that five and ten pieces are tracked through the back wheel to the touring bikes on the two sales orders respectively.  

     The last five pieces are untracked. Proceed to analyze.  

2.  Choose the **Untracked Quantity** field.  

     The **Untracked Planning Elements** page shows that item 1250 uses a planning parameter, Order Multiple, of 10.00. Therefore, the planning line is for 20 pieces in total to round the actual need up to the nearest number divisible by 10. The last five pieces are an untracked quantity to satisfy the planning parameter.  

3.  Close all pages except the **Planning Worksheet** page.  

### To view an existing order  

1.  In the planning line for item 1250, choose the **Ref. Order No.** field.  
2.  On the **Firm Planned Prod. Order** page for the Back Hub. The existing order for ten pieces, which you created in the first planning run, opens.  
3.  Close the firm planned production order.  

 This completes the walkthrough of how the planning system is used to automatically detect demand, calculate the appropriate supply orders according to demand and planning parameters, and then automatically create different types of supply orders with the appropriate dates and quantities.

# Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview

Small and mid-sized companies rely on built-in analytics and reporting capabilities they can use out-of-the-box to help keep track of their business. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides reports and analytics tools that cover basic and complex business processes.

## Analytics needs in organizations

When you think about analytics in your organization, it might help to use a persona-based model to outline different needs.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

The model is based on the fact that different roles in an organization have different needs when it comes to data. The higher a role is placed in the organizational chart, the more aggregated data someone in the role needs to do their work.

Roles often have preferred ways to consume and analyze data, ways that reflect the level of data aggregation they need.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

Use the following sections to learn more about ways to consume data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Financial Reports
- KPIs and dashboards
- Power BI apps
- Ad-hoc analysis
- Reports

## Using Financial Reports to produce financial statements and KPIs

The Financial Reports feature gives you insight into the financial data stored in your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries.

:::image type="content" source="media/acc_schedule_13_columns.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of a financial report." lightbox="media/acc_schedule_13_columns.jpg":::

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence. A dimension is data that you can add to an entry as a parameter. Dimensions let you group entries that have similar characteristics. For example, groups of customers, regions, products, and salesperson. Groups make it easier to retrieve data for analysis. Among other purposes, you use dimensions when you define analysis views and create financial reports. Learn more at [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

To learn more about financial statements and KPIs, go to [Using Financial reporting to produce financial statements and KPIs](bi.md).

## Using key performance indicators to meet your business goals

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. Think of KPIs as your company’s scorecard, a way to measure whether you’re delivering on your objectives.

Identifying and tracking KPIs lets you know whether your business is on the right path, or whether you should change course. When used properly, KPIs are powerful tools that help you:

- Monitor company financial health.
- Measure progress against strategic goals.
- Spot problems early on.
- Make timely adjustments to tactics.
- Motivate team members.
- Make better decisions, faster.

To learn more about KPIs, go to [Using key performance indicators to meet your business goals](./analytics-about-kpis.md)

## Built-in Power BI apps 

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-apps-overview](includes/powerbi-apps-overview.md)]

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/financial-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Finance Overview report" lightbox="media/finance/financial-overview.png":::

To learn more, go to [Power BI apps/reports by functional area](across-powerbi-apps-by-functional-area.md)

## Ad-hoc data analysis

You might just want to check whether the numbers add up correctly, quickly confirm or debunk a hypothesis about the business, or maybe look for anomalies in your financial data. For ad-hoc analyses, you might not have a built-in report that helps answer your questions. For ad-hoc analyses, use these two features:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as the General Ledger Entries or Customer Ledger Entries pages, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit. 

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-gl-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the G/L entries page." lightbox="media/data-analysis-gl-entries.png":::

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

## Reports

A report in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gathers information based on a specified set of criteria. Reports organize and present the information in an easy-to-read format you can use in Excel, print, or save as a file.  

As an example of an interactive report in Excel, the **Aged Accounts Receivable** report lets you analyze what your customers owe you and when payments are due.

:::image type="content" source="media/aged-accounts-receivables-excel.png" alt-text="Example of the interactive aged accounts receivables report in Excel." lightbox="media/aged-accounts-receivables-excel.png":::

For aged accounts receivables, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also includes a report designed for print. The ability to print is handy if you prefer to have the data in a .pdf file.

:::image type="content" source="media/aged-accounts-receivables-pdf.png" alt-text="Example of the  aged accounts receivables report in pdf." lightbox="media/aged-accounts-receivables-pdf.png":::

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] comes with more than 300 built-in reports that you can use to support your business processes with data-driven insights. To get a quick overview of all the reports that are available for your role, you can open the report explorer from the role center and all list pages and from **Tell Me**.

# Set Up Resource Allocation
To ensure that a service task is performed well, it's important to find a resource who is qualified to do the work. You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so that it's easy to allocate someone who has the right skills for the job. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], we call this _resource allocation_. You can allocate resources based on their skill, availability, or whether they are in the same service zone as the customer. 

To use resource allocation, you must set up:  
  
* The skills required to repair and maintain service items. You assign these to service items and resources.  
* Geographic regions, called zones, that you define for your market. For example, East, West, Central, and so on. You assign these to customers and resources.  
* Whether to display resource skills and zones, and whether to display a warning if someone chooses unqualified resource, or a resource that is not in the customer zone.  

## To set up skills
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Skills**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To assign skills to service items and resources
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Items** or **Resources**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the card for the service item or resource, and then choose one of the following:  
  
    * For service items, choose **Resource Skills**.  
    * For resources, choose **Skills**.  

## To set up zones
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Zones**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To assign zones to customers and resources 
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers** or **Resources**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the card for the service item or resource, and then choose one of the following:  
  
    * For customers, choose a zone in the **Service Zone Code** field.  
    * For resources, choose the **Service Zones** action.  

## To specify what to show when a resource is chosen
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Management Setup**, and then choose the related link. 
2. In the **Resource Skills Option** field, choose one of the options described in the following table.  
  
    |**Option**|**Description**|  
    |------------|-------------|  
    |Code Shown | Displays the code only.|  
    |Warning Displayed | Shows the information and displays a warning if you choose a resource that is not qualified.|  
    |Not Used | Does not show this information.|  

## To update resource capacity  
You may need to change the capacity of resources.  
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resource Capacity**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the resource, and then choose the **Set Capacity** action.  
3. Make the changes, and then choose **Update Capacity**.  

## To update skills for items, service items, or service item groups
If you want to change the skill codes assigned to items, for example from **PC** to **PCS**, you can do so either for an item, service item, or for all items in a service item group.  
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items** or **Service Item**, or **Service Item Group**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the entity to update, and then choose the **Resource Skills** action.  
3. On the line with the code to be changed, in the **Skill Code** field, choose the relevant skill code.  
4.  If the item has associated service items, a dialog box opens with the following two options:  
  
    * Change the skill codes to the selected value: Select this option if you want to replace the old skill code with the new one on all the related service items.  
    * Delete the skill codes or update their relation: Select this option if you want to change the skill code on this item only. The skill code on the related service items will be reassigned, that is, the **Assigned From** field will be updated.

# Adding Contacts to Segments
After you have created a segment and entered basic information about it, you may want to add contacts to the segment. You can do this by filling in the lines on the **Segment** page manually, but it is easier and faster to use the **Add Contacts** action.

## To add a contact to a segment
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Segments**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the segment, and then choose the **Add Contacts** action. The **Add Contacts** batch job page opens.
3. In the **Contact** section, set filters to specify the information by which you want to select contacts.

To enter additional filters, repeat this procedure on each of the remaining sections, and then choose the **OK** button.

If you have added contacts by mistake and want to go back one step, then choose the **Go Back** action.

## To refine the number of contacts
After you have selected the contacts within a segment, you may decide to remove some but keep others. You can manually remove contacts from the lines on the **Segment** page, but it is easier and faster to use the **Refine Contacts** action.

1. Open the segment.
2. Choose **Contacts**, and then choose the **Refine Contacts** action. The **Remove Contacts - Refine** page opens.
3. In the **Contact** section, enter filters to specify the information that you want to use to select the contacts to be removed from the segment.
4. Add additional filters as needed, and then choose the **OK** button.

You can refine a segment as many times as you want. If you have refined the segment by mistake and want to go one step back, choose the **Go Back**.

To see a list of the segment criteria that you have used, in the **General** section, choose the **No. of Criteria Actions** field.

## To reduce the number of contacts
After you have selected the contacts within a segment, you may want to remove some of them. You can do this by manually removing them from the lines in the Segment page, but it is easier and faster to use the Reduce Contacts function to specify which contacts to remove, and to use the Refine Contacts function to specify which contacts to keep.

1. Open the segment.
2. Choose Contacts, and then choose the **Reduce Contacts** action. The **Remove Contacts - Reduce** page opens.
3. In the **Contact** section, enter filters to specify the information that you want to use to select the contacts to be removed from the segment.
4. Add additional filters as needed, and then choose the **OK** button.

You can reduce a segment as many times as you want. If you have refined the segment by mistake and want to go one step back, then choose the **Go Back** action.

# Service Management

> [!NOTE]
> The functionality described in this topic and sub topics is only visible in the user interface if you have the **Premium** experience. For more information, see [Change Which Features are Displayed](ui-experiences.md).

Providing ongoing service to customers is an important part of any business and one that can be a source of customer satisfaction and loyalty, in addition to revenue. However, managing and tracking service isn't always easy, and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a set of tools to help. These tools are designed to support repair shops and field service operations, and support typical scenarios for those businesses:

* Schedule service calls.
* Manage service orders.  
* Track repair parts and supplies.  
* Assign service personnel based on skill and availability.  
* Provide service estimates and service invoices.  

In addition, you can standardize coding, set up contracts, implement a discounting policy, and create route maps for service employees.

# Delete cost budget entries

You use the **Delete Cost Budget Entries** batch job to cancel cost budget entries from the cost budget register.  

To prevent any gaps in the cost budget entries and cost register entries, you can't delete a single entry or a batch of entries in the middle of the list of register entries.  

## To delete a cost budget entry  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Cost Budget Entries**, and then choose the related link.  

    The **To Register No.** field contains the last register entry number and can't be changed.  

    You can use the **From Register No.** field to select a register entry number from which the deletion should begin.  
2. Choose the **OK** button to delete the selected cost budget entries.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To avoid an accidental deletion of cost budget entries, you can close register entries by marking the lines as **Closed** in the **Closed** field on the **Cost Budget Registers** page.

# Get started creating report layouts

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes many built-in layouts that you can use on your reports. Other layouts might be added as part of extensions. In addition, you can create your own report layouts, either from scratch or based on an existing layout.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use report layouts to add content to email messages. Report layouts can help save time and ensure consistency by reusing the same content when you communicate with your customers. Only custom report layouts of the **Word** type can be used with email. You can't use layouts of the **RDLC** with email. Learn more in [Set up reusable email texts and layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts).

## Overview of report layouts

It can be helpful to think of a report layout as a file that is imported and assigned to a report. You manage all layouts in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in basically the same way, regardless of the layout type. Usually, you work from the **Report Layouts** page. The layouts differ mainly in the way that you design them. Each layout is designed by using the software that the layout is built on, such Word, Excel, or SQL Server Report Builder.

The process of setting up a layout for a report involves three or four basic tasks.

1. Choose the layout type.
2. Export a copy of an existing layout so that you can use it as a starting point.
3. Make changes to the layout file in the appropriate application.
4. Add the new layout file to the report.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can modify or replace only user-defined layouts. You can't modify or replace *extension layouts*, which are layouts that originate from an extension. On the **Report Layouts** page, you can tell whether a layout is a user-defined layout or an extension layout by looking in the **Extension** column. For an extension layout, the **Extension** column shows information about the source extension. For a user-defined layout, the **Extension** column is blank.
>
> Learn more about the difference between extension layouts and user-defined layouts in [Layout sources](ui-manage-report-layouts.md#layout-sources).

## Get started

Depending on your situation, the actual tasks vary. Use the following table to get started.

| What do you want to do? | Learn more |
|---|---|
| Figure out the best layout type to use for my situation. | [Decide what type of layout you want](#decide) |
| Create a new layout for a report, either from scratch or based on a copy of an existing layout. | [Create a new layout](#create) |
| Make changes to the layout that a report uses. | [Modify a layout](#modify) |
| Replace the current layout file that a report uses with a new version of the layout file. | [Replace a layout](#replace) |

| Validate a layout. | [Validate a layout](#validate) |
| View information about a layout. | [Get information about a layout](#get-information-about-a-layout) |
| Delete a user-defined layout. | [Delete a layout](#delete) |

## <a name="decide"></a>Decide what type of layout you want

The first task when you create a layout is to decide which [layout type](ui-manage-report-layouts.md#layout-types) you want. You can choose among the **Word**, **Excel**, and **RDLC** layout types. Your choice depends on how you want the generated report to look. It also depends on your knowledge of the software that is used to create the layout, such as Word, Excel, and SQL Server Report Builder.

* **Excel** layouts are generally the easiest to create and modify because summarizing data, adding graphics, and styling are common Excel features. However, not all reports have datasets optimized for Excel layouts. Aggregations and complex calculations work best with **RDLC** or **Word** layouts. The same applies to documents.
* If you're making only style changes, such as changes to the font type, size, and colors, a **Word** layout is a good choice.
* The capabilities for adding and rearranging data fields are more advanced in **Word** and **RDLC** layouts than in **Excel** layouts.
* **Word** and **RDLC** layouts are good choices for printable reports.
* The design concepts for **Word** and **RDLC** layouts are similar, but each has specific features that affect the report's appearance in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The same report might look different depending on whether a **Word** or **RDLC** layout is used.

## <a name="create"></a>Create a new layout

There are different methods for creating a new layout. The easiest methods involve using a copy of an existing layout. For these methods, you can either save the existing layout directly as a copy, or export it and then import it into a new layout. Another, more advanced method is to create a layout from scratch by using a blank layout.

### [Copy a layout](#tab/copy)

Copying an existing layout lets you quickly create a new, identical layout that you can customize.

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]

   The **Report Layouts** page lists all layouts for all reports.
1. Select the layout that you want to copy for the new layout, and then select the **Edit Info** action.

    If you select an extension layout, you're asked whether you want to edit a copy of it. Select **Yes**.

    > [!TIP]
    > To find the layout that you want, use the search field, the filter pane, and column sorting.

1. In the **Layout Name** field, enter a new name.
1. Turn on the **Save Changes to Copy** toggle, if it isn't already on.
1. Select **OK**.

    The new layout appears on the **Report Layouts** page.

If needed, you can change the settings in your new layout. To learn more, go to [Change settings in a new layout](#modify).

### [Export a layout copy and import it as a new layout](#tab/export)

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
1. Select the layout that you want to copy for the new layout, and then select the **Export Layout** action.

    The layout file is downloaded to your device.

    > [!TIP]
    > To find the layout that you want, use the search field, the filter pane, and column sorting.

1. Open the layout file in the appropriate application, such as Word (for a .docx file) or Excel (for an .xlsx file).

    Learn more in the following articles:

    * [Work with Word Layouts](ui-how-add-fields-word-report-layout.md)
    * [Working with Microsoft Excel layouts](ui-excel-report-layouts.md)
    * [Working with RDLC Layouts](ui-rdlc-report-layouts.md)

1. Make the required changes to the file, and then save it.
1. On the **Report Layouts** page, select **New**.
1. In the **Add New Layout for a Report** dialog box, fill in the fields described in the following table.

    | Field | Description | Mandatory |
    |---|---|---|
    | Report ID | Enter the ID that is assigned to the report. | Yes |
    | Layout Name | Enter a brief, descriptive name for the layout to help you easily identify it. | Yes |
    | Description | Enter more detailed information about the layout. | No |
    | Format Options | Set this field to match the type of the layout (for example, **Word**, **Excel**, or **RDLC**). | Yes |

1. Select **OK**.
1. Follow one of these steps to upload the layout file for the report:

    [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]

    The selected file is uploaded to the layout, and you're returned to the **Report Layouts** page.

To view how the report looks with the new layout, select the layout in the list, and then select **Run Report**.

### [Create from blank](#tab/blank)

When you create a new layout from a blank layout, you must design it completely. The layout file provides all the report fields that you can add and arrange as you require.

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
1. Select any layout that is for the same report that you want use the new layout for.
1. Select **New**.
1. In the **Add New Layout for a Report** dialog box, set the following fields.

    | Field | Description | Mandatory |
    |---|---|---|
    | Report ID | Enter the ID that is assigned to the report. | Yes |
    | Layout Name | Enter a brief descriptive name for the layout to help you easily identify it. | Yes |
    | Description | Enter more detailed information about the layout. | No |
    | Format Options | Set this field to match the type of the layout (for example, **Word**, **Excel**, or **RDLC**). | Yes |

1. Turn on the **Create a blank layout from the report object** option.
1. Select **OK**.

    The new layout appears in the list. The layout is blank, but all the report fields and captions are available so that you can start to add them to the layout.

1. You can now start to [design the layout](#modify).

# Configure service management processes

The following are some examples of the settings you can apply to service management processes:  
  
* Some overall settings for various processes, such as warnings, next service calculations for service items, the start-up fee to assess, the fault reporting level to use, and so on.  
* The types of information that technicians enter on service documents. For example, you can require them to specify the type of order, the start and/or end dates for the work, and the type of work that was done.  
* Some default settings for response times and warranties. These include a default response time for starting service, warranty discount percentages for parts and labor, and how long warranties are valid for.  
* Settings for contracts, such as the maximum number of days that you can use for contract service orders, whether to use reason codes when a contract is canceled, standard texts for descriptions, and contract values.  
* The number sequences to use for service-related documents and items.  

## To enter general and mandatory settings

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Management Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## Set up service invoice posting policies for users

Companies often have unique processes for invoices and shipments. For example, processes can vary from one person posting everything on a service order to multiple employees, each working with their own pages.

You can use posting policies to restrict users from posting service invoices, or require them to post invoices together with the related service shipment. To set up a posting policy, on the **User Setup** page, in the **Service Invoice Posting Policy** field, choose one of the following options:

* **Allowed** (Default): Keep the current behavior, where you can choose the posting options, such as **Ship**, **Invoice**, and **Ship and Invoice**.
* **Prohibited**: Prevent people from posting service invoices. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows a confirmation dialog that only provides the **Ship** option.
* **Mandatory**: Let people post invoices along with service shipments. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows a confirmation dialog that only provides the **Ship and Invoice** option.

This setting affects the following documents:

* Service orders
* Warehouse shipments
* Service invoices
* Service credit memos

The following table describes the effects on different documents.

|Document  |Allow<br>Displays a series of options   |Prohibited<br>Conformation dialog  |Mandatory<br>Confirmation dialog  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Service order     | * Ship<br>* Invoice<br>* Ship and Invoice<br>* Ship and Consume         |* Ship<br>* Ship and Consume  |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?         |
|Warehouse Shipment     |* Ship<br>* Ship and Invoice         |Do you want to post the shipment?         | Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?        |
|Service invoice     | Do you want to post the invoice?         | Error: you cannot post.       |Do you want to post the invoice?         |
|Service credit memo     | Do you want to post the credit memo?         | Error: you cannot post.        |Do you want to post the credit memo?         |

> [!NOTE]
> When you post service invoices and credit memos, you don't have any posting options. The documents always post physical and financial transactions together. You can't partially post service invoices and credit memos.

## Send service documents to the right people

Your business probably deals with multiple customer and vendor contacts who are responsible for different areas of operation. For example, accountants, purchasers, and warehouse staff. Because their interests typically differ, you might want to generate and send different types of documents to them. You can save time when you send documents to different customer or vendor contacts by setting up specific contacts to use with specific documents. For example, send service invoices to accountant contacts and service orders to your customers' purchasers.

You can use the **Document Layouts** page to specify who to send service quotes, orders, invoices, and credit memos to for vendors and customers based on settings on the **Report Selection** page. To send specific documents to specific company contacts, choose the company contacts to use for specific document layouts. To learn more about document layouts, go to [Define document layouts for customers and vendors](ui-define-customer-vendor-document-layouts.md).

# Year-Over-Year (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Year-Over-Year** report helps business leaders analyze purchasing performance and track spending trends over time. By comparing purchase amounts in the current year with amounts from the previous year, this report provides valuable insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of purchasing activities.

In addition to identifying trends and changes, the report helps leaders make informed decisions about future purchasing strategies. It's an important indicator of growth and spending patterns, providing an overview of the money you spend to make products and generate revenues.

Together with year-over-year financial figures, the report gives a comprehensive view of an organization's financial health. Tracking these figures helps leaders make informed decisions about resource allocation, budgeting, and forecasting.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-year-over-year.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Year-over-Year Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-year-over-year.png":::

## Use the report

The report is intended for business leaders and managers.

COOs ensure that the purchasing department operates efficiently and effectively. One of the key metrics you monitor is the year-over-year growth in purchases. This report lets you quickly explore purchase trends over time, and identify areas of concern. For example, you might notice that purchases are increasing rapidly in a particular item category. You can use this information to discuss how to manage costs with the head of purchasing.

Purchasing managers ensure that the company sources goods at the best price without compromising quality. Use this report to track purchasing trends across different categories and identify areas where you can save. For example, you might notice a rapid increase in purchases of a category of products. With this information in mind, you can work with the manufacturing team to identify whether to change item planning or supplier selection to optimize product cost and quality.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Year-Over-Year* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Current Year**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)
- [**Previous Year (Fiscal)**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount-py-fiscal)
- [**Current Year YOY (Fiscal)**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount-yoy-fiscal)

# Design details: Item tracking and planning
Because they are stored in the reservation system, item tracking numbers are fully coordinated with order tracking records. This means that items with order tracking records can be assigned item tracking numbers. Conversely, items that have item tracking numbers can become order tracking records. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Tracking Design](design-details-item-tracking-design.md).

For more information about the integrated systems, see [Design Details: Reservations, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).

Because order tracking is only concerned with specific item application, the coordination with item tracking numbers only applies to items that are set up to use specific item tracking. This is set by the **SN Specific Tracking** and **Lot Specific Tracking** fields on the item card, which specify the following:

- The item must carry a serial number or lot number when it is posted.
- The item must apply to the same serial number or lot number when it is posted outbound.

In alignment with standard supply/demand balancing principles, the planning system and the related order tracking feature only match supply and demand carrying item tracking numbers if the item in question uses specific item tracking. In all other cases, the planning and order tracking systems ignore item tracking numbers when they apply supply to meet demand or apply demand to supply. For more information, see [Design Details: Reservation, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).

For example, when order tracking exists for a given item, it implies that records for the item are already in the **Reservation Entry** table, which is the core of the reservation system, before the item tracking numbers are defined. Therefore, the following coupling restrictions apply to the item tracking numbers to be order tracked:

- Demand with a serial number or lot number can only cover supply with the same serial number or lot number.
- Demand without a serial or lot number can cover any supply, with or without a serial or lot number.

Apart from their consequences on dynamic order tracking, the item tracking coupling restrictions do not affect the planning system significantly.

On the supply side, a serial or lot number is typically not entered until immediately before the order is posted, such as a purchase receipt into the warehouse. When entering a serial or lot number on the demand side, such as on a sales order, that serial or lot number is already in inventory. Accordingly, item tracking numbers are typically not an issue in supply planning.

For items that use specific item tracking, all demand carrying serial or lot numbers must be matched by corresponding supply. In most cases, it does not make sense to reorder a specific serial or lot number, so the planning of purchase or production supplies is probably not affected. However, when transferring items from one location to another, it is likely that the transfer is for a specific lot, so planning transfer supplies might be affected by the specific coupling restriction.

For more information, see [Design Details: Transfers in Planning](design-details-transfers-in-planning.md).

## Balancing demand and supply
If an item requires specific item tracking, then an order tracking link is made from all the item’s item tracking demand to any corresponding item tracking supply, with the sole limitation that supply should come before demand. If, under those circumstances, no item tracking supply can be found that corresponds to the item tracking-specific demand, then a new item tracking supply is created immediately and without considering order sizing, planning parameters, or rescheduling of existing supply of the same serial or lot number.

If item tracking numbers are assigned on the demand side or on the supply side without requiring specific item tracking, then an order track link is made from the demand to that supply, based on the most suitable timing and quantity, as in the usual balancing procedure. The specified item tracking number goes into the order tracking record in the same way that any specified item tracking quantity defines one end of the order tracking link. This means that the item tracking number that is entered is preserved while it is also part of the order tracking record.

If item tracking numbers are assigned on the supply side without requiring specific item tracking, then this supply is regarded as fixed by the planning system. No resizing or rescheduling is suggested for this supply, but the supply is taken into consideration when the planning system tries to meet the gross requirements.

For more information, see [Design Details: Balancing Demand and Supply](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md).

# Work with Manufacturing Batch Units of Measure
If an item is stocked in one unit of measure but produced in another, a production order is created that uses a manufacturing batch unit of measure to calculate the correct quantity of the components during the **Refresh Production Order** batch job. An example of a manufacturing batch unit of measure calculation is when a manufactured item is stocked in pieces but produced in tons.  

## To create a production BOM using a batch unit of measure  
1.  The manufacturing batch unit of measure is set up as an alternative unit of measure on the **Item Units of Measure** page on the item to be produced. The batch unit of measure will not replace the base unit of measure on the item.  
2.  Create a production BOM for the item set up with the manufacturing batch unit of measure. For more information, see [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).  
3.  In the **Unit of Measure Code** field, select the manufacturing batch unit of measure.  
4.  For each production BOM line, in the **Quantity Per** field, enter the quantity of this component item that is required to create this batch unit of measure.  
5.  Open the **Item Card** for the related item.  

    On the **Replenishment** FastTab, in the **Production BOM No.** field, select the production BOM created above.  
6.  Create a production order header using the item set up with the manufacturing batch unit of measure. For more information, see [Create Production Orders](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md).  
7.  Choose the **Refresh** action, and then choose  the **OK** button.  

On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Components** action to view the result. The application calculates the correct quantity of the components needed to satisfy the production BOM based on the manufacturing batch unit of measure.  

## To calculate a manufacturing batch unit of measure on a production order  
1.  Create a production order header using the item set up with the manufacturing batch unit of measure.  
2.  In the **Item No.** field in the Production Order line, type the same item number used in the header.  
3.  In the **Quantity** field, enter the same quantity used in the header.  
4.  In the **Unit of Measure Code** field, select the manufacturing batch unit of measure code.  
5.  Choose the **Refresh** action.
6.  On the **Calculate** FastTab, clear the **Lines** check box.  
7.  Choose the **OK** button.  
8.  On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Components** action to view the result. The correct quantity of the components needed to satisfy the production BOM is calculated based on the manufacturing batch unit of measure.

title: Track item cost adjustments
description: Learn how tracking adjustments to item costs can help you keep your item cost data accurate.

# Track item cost adjustments

It's important to keep item costs accurate and shorten the time between when you post an entry and when the general ledger reflects its cost. You can track the performance of the cost adjustments for individual adjustment runs and items. If errors happen, you can identify the problematic items and make corrections. For example, you can exclude the items from calculations to ensure adjustments aren't interrupted for other items. You can adjust costs for individual items or create batches of items and adjust them all at the same time.

## Start tracking cost adjustments

It's easy to get started. On the **Inventory Setup** page, the **Cost Adjustment Logging** field offers a few options:

* **Disabled** means you don't log cost adjustment runs.
* **Errors Only** means you log only runs that failed.
* **All** means you log all runs.

> [!NOTE]
> To minimize the size of the log, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't log the adjustments that happen automatically when someone posts an item.

You must also set up the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L (1002)** job queue entry. This job queue entry automatically adjusts costs according to a schedule. To learn more about job queue entries, go to [Use job queues to schedule tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## Manage cost adjustments

Use the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page to manage and monitor the cost adjustment process. This page displays items along with their costing parameters and cost adjustment status. You can filter the list to focus on items that require adjustment or that are excluded from the cost adjustment process.

### About item batches

You can run cost adjustments for several items by grouping them into batches. Batches make it easy to adjust some items separately, for example, because they take longer to adjust. Batches can also help identify items that have issues.

To create a batch, on the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page:

* Select the items in the list, choose **Run cost adjustment**, and then choose **Add Batch**.

To create a batch and run cost adjustment immediately:
* Select the items in the list, choose **Run cost adjustment**, and then choose **Add batch and run**.
* Choose **Run cost adjustment**, choose **Item Batches**, and then enter a filter in the **Item Filter** field.
  
> [!TIP]
> To quickly create another batch for all items that aren't already included in a batch, on the **Cost Adjustment - Item Batches** page, choose **Add Missing Items**.

When a run for a batch finishes, the batch has one of the following status on the **Item Batches** page:

* **Success**: The cost adjustment is successful.
* **Failed**: If the cost adjustment fails, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] identifies the item that caused the error and then splits the current batch into two. One batch with the problematic item, and another with the remaining items. Cost adjustment reruns for the batch with the remaining items. If it fails again, the process repeats. You define the maximum number of splits in the **Max. Retry Attempts** field. The default value for retries is 10, but you can enter a new limit.
* **Timed out**: If the cost adjustment for a batch doesn't finish within the period specified in the **Timeout (Minutes)** field (ranging from 1 to 720 minutes), the session terminates and changes are rolled back. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] then splits the current batch in half and reruns the cost adjustment process for each half. This process continues until the cost adjustment is successful or reaches the maximum retry attempts.

> [TIP!]
> Each batch runs in a separate session. To monitor progress, use the **Refresh** action.

### Run cost adjustment

Use the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page to make adjustments.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Cost Adjustment**, and then choose the related link.
1. Depending on what you want to do, use one of the following options:

  * For one or more items immediately, select the items in the list and then choose **Run cost adjustment**.
  * For batches, use one of the following options:

    * To create a batch and adjust costs immediately, choose the items in the list, choose **Run cost adjustment**, and then **Add batch and run**.
    * To run it for all batches, choose **Run cost adjustment**, **Item Batches**, and then choose **Run**. To learn more about batches, go to [About item batches](#about-item-batches).
  * For all items on an item-by-item basis, which saves the results after each item is processed. For example, this option is useful for handling a large number of items, reducing lock times, and preventing full reruns if something goes wrong. To use this option, run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** report, and turn on the **Item-by-Item Adjustment** toggle.

### Explore item details

Use the **Item** menu to access information about cost adjustments for a selected item.

* **Item Ledger Entries**: List item entries for the item. The **Mark for Adjustment** action lets you force the rerun of cost adjustment for items directly or indirectly linked to the inbound entries you select. Forcing a rerun can be helpful if previous runs led to incorrect costs.
* **Value Entries**: List value entries for the item.
* **Cost Adjmt. Entry Points**: Open the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** page, which you primarily use to calculate average cost. The page displays combinations of items, locations, variants, and valuation dates for which cost adjustments are, or must be, run.
* **Cost Adjmt. Orders**: Open the **Inventory Adjmt. Entry (Order)** page, where you adjust production and assembly orders. It shows the orders are adjusted or require adjustment.
* **Item Application Entries**: Open the **Item Application Entries** page for details about quantity and cost applications. You can use the **Reset Outbound Entry is Updated** action in combination with the **Mark for Adjustment** setting on the **Item Ledger Entries** page to force a rerun of cost adjustment.

### View the outcome

Use the **Log per** menu to view the outcome of cost adjustments:

* **Run**: Show cost adjustment logs for each run. The log includes data about the item filter, status (Success/Failed/Timed out), start and end date/time, duration, and the cost differences produced by the run.
* **Item**: Show detailed information about the adjustment process for the selected item.

### Include or exclude items from adjustments

If one or more items fail, you can exclude the items from the adjustment run and then include them in later runs. On the **Functions** menu, choose one of the following:

* **Exclude item from adjustment** and **Include item in adjustment**: Temporarily disable and then re-enable cost adjustment for a selected item. Cost adjustment continues to keep costs accurate for other items while you investigate an issue with a specific item.

### Use iterative cost adjustments

To manage the processing scope of cost adjustments for items that have a high volume of transactions, you can do the adjustments on a period-by-period basis. You can do that in just a few steps. On the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page, select the item to adjust, choose the **Cost Adjmt. Entry Points** action. Next, choose the **Valuation Date** until you want to complete the adjustment and then choose the **Adjust Cost Until Valuation Date** action.

These steps adjust entries for the selected item up to the chosen date and affects entries across all locations and variants. The item is marked as adjusted when all periods are fully adjusted.

You can also adjust costs for individual production and assembly orders. On the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page, select one or more production or assembly orders, and then choose the **Adjust Cost for Selected Orders** action.

## Post adjusted costs to the general ledger

Typically, new value entries are posted to the general ledger according to the schedule for the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L (1002)** job queue entry. However, you can post adjustments to the general ledger immediately from the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page. On the **Functions** menu, choose **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**.

## Troubleshoot cost adjustments

Use the following options on the **Diagnostics** menu to troubleshoot cost adjustment runs.

* **Export item data**: Export item-related data to a text file. You can use the file for further analysis in a sandbox environment or attach it to a support request when investigating costing calculation issues.
* **Import item data**: Import the previously exported text file back into the database. This action is only enabled in sandbox environments or evaluation companies.
* **Reset Cost Is Adjusted**: Reset the **Cost Is Adjusted** toggle on items, production orders, or assembly orders. This setting allows you to force the rerun of the cost adjustment for them.
* **Costing Issues Detection report**: Diagnose typical data issues cause calculation errors in costing. It checks whether the item ledger entries, value entries, item application entries, and capacity ledger entries are correct.
* **Delete item data**: Clear all item-related tables in the database. This action is only available in sandbox environments or evaluation companies.

### Self-diagnostics for potential issues and performance pitfalls

During posting and cost adjustment, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] scans the current setup and data to identify inefficiencies that might affect the accuracy and performance of cost adjustment.

When you open the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page, a notification might state that issues were found. You can view the issues on the **Action Messages** page by selecting **Action Messages** in the **Diagnostics** section.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] issues warnings in the following scenarios:

* Cost adjustment isn't set for automatic runs or run manually.
* Average cost adjustment settings aren't optimal for performance.
* Inventory periods aren't in use.
* Many periods require adjustment.
* Many production and assembly orders require adjustment.
* Cost adjustment for a single item takes more than five minutes to complete.
* One or more items are excluded from cost adjustment.
* Data discrepancies remain after cost adjustment completes.

Scanning happens automatically during normal system usage, but you can start it manually at any time by selecting the **Run Tests** action on the **Cost Adjmt. Action Messages** page. You can't turn off diagnostics completely but you can pause it for up to 30 days by choosing **Snooze for 30 days**.

## Use the Cost Adjustment Tracer feature

Cost adjustment can take time to complete. For example, due to a high volume of entries, data errors, or a setup that isn't optimal. Because the cause is often unclear, you can use the Cost Adjustment Tracer feature to gain visibility and get some help to diagnose data-related issues.

To use the Cost Adjustment Tracer feature, on the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page, choose **Item Batches**. Create a batch for one or more items, fill in the **Timeout (minutes)** field, select the **Trace** checkbox, and then choose the **Run** action.

During the cost adjustment process, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records AL events, items, locations, variants, entries, and orders it processes. When the cost adjustment completes or reaches the specified time-out, it saves the results in the **Trace Log**. To access the recorded details, select **Trace Log**. Due to the potentially large volume of log entries, we recommend that you turn on the **Analysis View** mode to summarize the data.

# Teams FAQ

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

This article answers some of the questions you might have about working with Microsoft Teams and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## [General](#tab/general)

### How do I sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams?

After installing the app, you'll be asked to sign in the first time you use it, when you paste a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] link into Teams chat, or choose the **Details** action on a card in Teams. Depending on your Teams client, you might have to enter the credentials you use to access [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### How do I sign out of the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams?

To sign out of the identity in Teams you used to connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], go to any chat compose box, right-click the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] icon underneath, then choose **Settings**. When the window appears, check your currently signed in identity and then choose **Sign out**.

### Does the app for Teams connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises? 

No. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams only works with [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] online. There are no plans to support [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] deployment types&mdash;such as on-premises, hybrid cloud, or private cloud&mdash;that Microsoft doesn't host or manage directly.

### Does the app work with multiple companies and environments? 

Yes. To search for contacts in a different company, go to [Settings](across-teams-settings.md). When the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app expands a link into a card, the link must contain the environment and company names for the app to match the record to the right company. You can paste links to any companies and environments you have access to within your organization and from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] account you used to sign in. Participants in the chat will see the card. But they can't view the card details unless they have permissions to the company or environment where that record is stored.

### In which countries or regions is the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app available? 

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams isn't restricted by country or region. The app is available in all markets currently supported by the Teams marketplace.

### Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app work with any localization of [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]? 

Yes. The app works with any localization of [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], whether offered by Microsoft or a partner.  Learn more at [Country/regional availability and supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json).

### <a name="language"></a>Which languages does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app support?

Two things determine the language used for cards and card details in Teams:

1. Your language in Teams, which you can see from your account settings in Teams. 
2. Your language in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], which you can see in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] Web client (learn more in [Change Basic Setting - Language](ui-change-basic-settings.md#language)).

The following table explains how the experience differs for message authors and recipients, depending on language settings and availability of languages.

|Who|Card|Card details |
|-|----|--------------| 
|Message author |Displays in the language that's specified for you in Teams. If [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't offer that same language, the card is displayed in English. |Displayed in the language that's specified for you in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], which might include languages from language apps provided by partners. |
|Message recipient |Displays in the language of the message author. |Displays in the language that's specified for you in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. |

Get a list of supported languages for [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] in [Supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json#supported-languages).

### Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app work with industry solutions?

Yes. But only some features of the app work with Embed apps:

- The app works with links based on the **\*.bc.dynamics.com** pattern that's typically used with Embed apps.
- Contact search isn't available for Embed apps that replace the base application from Microsoft.

Learn more about emdeb apps in [Embed apps](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/embed-app-overview).

### Does [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] work with the Teams mobile app?

Yes. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app can be installed from the Teams desktop app or browser, or by an administrator for all users. Once installed, the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app is automatically available in Teams for iOS and Android. On mobile devices, you can only view cards sent by others, access details, or pop out the card to the full experience in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app. You can't paste links that expand into cards when composing messages or searching for contacts. Learn more about minimum requirements for mobile in [Minimum Requirements for Using Business Central](product-requirements.md).

### Is the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams the same as the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for iOS and Android?

No. The app for Teams is an add-in to Microsoft Teams and exclusively designed for collaboration within Teams. Alternatively, the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app delivers a rich experience for you to work with [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] data on your mobile devices.

Mobile users are encouraged to install both the mobile app and the app for Teams to get the most out of [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. With both installed, you can choose the **Pop out** action on a card in Teams to open the card details in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app. Learn more about installing the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] and Teams mobile apps in:

- [Get Business Central on Your Mobile Device](install-mobile-app.md)
- [Get the Teams Mobile App](https://support.microsoft.com/office/download-the-mobile-app-for-teams-5940ebdc-0082-4fb1-83c4-751edc23dcb5) in Microsoft Support

### Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app work in all Teams clients?

No. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams isn't supported when installed as a package for macOS or Linux. On those platforms, use a supported browser to access Teams.

Learn more about minimum requirements in [Minimum Requirements for Using Business Central](product-requirements.md#teams).

Learn more about the choice of Teams clients and how to install them at [Get clients for Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/get-clients) in the Teams documentation.

### Which Teams client is best for [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]?

There are only minor differences and limitations between Teams clients that might affect your experience with the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams. When choosing a Teams client, consider:

- The camera and location can't be accessed from the details window in the Teams desktop app.
- Phone numbers can't be activated from the details window in Teams for iOS, Android, or in the browser.
- Using Microsoft Edge with Teams in the browser lets you easily work across multiple identities and accounts by signing in to Teams from different profiles. Learn more about using profiles in Microsoft Edge at [Sign in and create multiple profiles in Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/office/sign-in-and-create-multiple-profiles-in-microsoft-edge-df94e622-2061-49ae-ad1d-6f0e43ce6435) in Microsoft Support.

### What is the best way for me to demonstrate [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] and Microsoft Teams to prospective customers?

If you're a reselling partner, you might want to have an environment that you can show prospects as part of pre-sales demonstrations. To avoid affecting Microsoft Teams in your organization, you can get a Microsoft 365 demo account at [https://aka.ms/CDX](https://aka.ms/CDX). This account gives you full control of an independent Azure organization that includes Microsoft Teams and [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Preparing Demonstration Environments of Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/demo-environment).

### Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams cater to my customization and personalization?

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams can display cards for links to customer pages and tables in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], such as those pages and tables from your own custom extensions or AppSource.

The fields shown on a card in Teams can also be affected by [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] customizations installed for your organization. Cards don't consider any role-specific customizations or user personalization. However, the card details window shows record details as you would see them in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], including extensions, role customizations, and user personalization.

When you search for contacts, the fields matched in the **Contacts** table and fields shown in the search results aren't affected by any customization or personalization.

### How do the permissions required by the app affect my privacy?

Before installing the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, you can review the minimum permissions required for the app to function. By installing the app, you give the app permission to receive the messages and data you provide to it and you give Teams permission to store and process those messages.

Also, some [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] features require opening external links or access to your camera or geographic location. So suppose you wanted to capture a photo of a purchase invoice for processing. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app doesn't use these capabilities without your consent and they're only used by specific features in the **Details** window. When you use one of these features for the first time, Teams displays a dialog box asking you to grant access to the required device capabilities.

- In Teams desktop, you review and adjust app permissions from the **Settings** window. Select your profile picture at the top of the app, select **Settings** > **Permissions**, then select the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app.

- For Teams in the browser and Teams for iOS or Android, you can review or adjust permissions from your browser or device settings.

> [!NOTE]
> Exactly which [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] features prompt you for permissions depends on the add-on apps and customizations applied to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] environment you connect to.

### Where can I learn about my privacy? 

You can learn about how Microsoft handles your data in the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2030602). 

Contact your administrator to learn how your organization handles the privacy of your data.

### How do I uninstall the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams?

To remove the app that you installed for yourself, go to any chat compose box, find the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] icon underneath, right-click the icon, and select **Uninstall**.  

### Will Microsoft continue to improve the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams?

At Microsoft, we're constantly listening to feedback from our diverse user community and acting upon the top suggestions. To learn about what's next for the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, see the [Dynamics 365 release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/).

If you want to participate in improving the app for Teams, or have an idea that would help simplify your work or collaborative experiences in Teams, add an idea or vote for existing ideas at [https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas](https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas).

### Where can I find Teams integration inside the Business Central web client? 

To learn about the functionality in the web client that links to Teams, see [Share Records and Page Links in Microsoft Teams](across-working-with-teams.md#share-link).

## [Business Central Tabs](#tab/tabs)

### <a name="who-can-view"></a>Who can see the content of a tab?

Any person in your chat or channel who has:

1. The Business Central app for Teams installed.
2. Either a Business Central license or has been granted access to Business Central using their Microsoft 365 license.
3. Permissions to view the data on the page.

### <a name=#recommended-content></a>Where does the recommended content come from?

The recommended content that you can choose from in the **Tab content** option on a tab is based on your Role Center. The recommend content only includes list pages, like Customers, Sales Orders, and Vendors - not individuals card page alike a specific customer or vendor.

Specifically, the recommended content includes:

- Actions in the top navigation menu of the role center
- Any list pages you've bookmarked.
- If a list page offers different views, including any views you created, you also get to choose from those views

You can add list pages to the recommended content by adding bookmarks. You can also remove recommended content by deleting bookmarks. Learn more in [Bookmark a Page or Report on Your Role Center](ui-bookmarks.md).

If you switch the environment or company on the tab option, the recommended content will changed based on the Role Center and bookmarks for the environment and company you switch to.

### When I create a tab, does it grant permissions to the people in the channel or chat?

No. Creating tabs doesn't affect permissions, and users must already have permission to that data when they access the tab.

### Can I chat alongside a tab?

Yes. Use the chat icon to start the conversation. This chat thread is then associated with the tab. 

### If I remove a tab from a chat or channel, is any Business Central data deleted?

No.

### Can I safely rename a tab?

Yes. The contents of the tab are unrelated to the actual name of the tab. Rename at will! 

### I need to work across tasks in different windows. Can I do this?

Yes. You can pop out the tab to its own browser window to show the Business Central web client. 

### Can I add or pin tab in Team meetings?

No. The Business Central app for Teams doesn't support tabs in meetings.

### Can't add a tab if using ISV Urls like *.bc.dynamics.com (but can pin)

Not supported.

### When I do things in the tab, like navigate, resort, apply a filter, or search, do others see my changes?

No. Only field changes or running actions affect how others see the contents of the tab.

### Does the tab content refresh automatically? If not, how do I refresh it?

The content doesn't refresh automatically, and these currently no refresh button. The best way to refresh the content to make sure it's up to data, leave the tab and then come back. 

### Does this show lists and records from my customizations and add-ons?

Yes. 

### When I add a tab, will people see it in my language?

No. Each user views the tab contents in the language, region, and timezone settings from Business Central. 

### Can I have multiple tabs pointing to different content?

Yes.

### Can I also add tabs to chat with a single person?

Yes, as long as the chat isn't a draft (that is, a message hasn't been sent to initiate that chat) and the other person has the Business Central app installed too.

### Can I switch companies within a tab?

No.

### Is this different than using Teams' generic ability to create a tab that hosts a website?

Yes. We don't recommend that you use approach. In many cases, it doesn't work for Business Central.

## [Search for Contacts](#tab/contacts)

### Which tables does the app search in?

When searching for contacts from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, your search terms are matched against records in the **Contacts** table in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. 

### Which fields in the contacts table can I search?

As you type your search terms in the search box, the terms are matched against most fields in the **Contacts** table. The fields include, for example, the **No.**, **Name**, **Address**, **Phone No.** or **Mobile Phone No.**, and **Email** fields. 

Search terms aren't matched against any custom fields added to the **Contacts** table by apps and extensions.

### Do search results include companies and persons?

Yes. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], contacts can be of type **Company** or type **Person**, where one or more persons can be associated with a company. In the search results, companies and persons have different icons.

### Do contacts of any business relationship appear in the results?

Yes. Some contacts can represent customers or vendors, or both. Other contacts with no defined business relation typically represent prospective customers. Contacts with other business relations, including any custom relations you've configured in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], will also be displayed in the search results.

### Can I look up contact details during meetings?

Yes. You can look up contact information, history of interaction, and related documents for your customer or vendor during a Teams meeting or call while the meeting is happening, without leaving Teams.

In fact, you can look up contact details from anywhere in Teams by using the **Search** box. You can, for example, look up contact details from the Teams calendar to help you set up meetings.

### How do I view my last interactions with a contact?

The details window for a contact displays interaction log entries. The interaction log entries provide the history of interactions that your organization has had with the specific contact. The interactions can include emails you've exchanged, calls you've received, or documents you've sent.

For interactions to be displayed, [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] must be configured to track interactions. To learn more about logging interactions, see [Record Interactions With Contacts](marketing-interactions.md).

### How do I register a Teams call or meeting as an interaction?

From the details window for a contact, find the **Create Interaction** action, and choose from the incoming or outgoing calls as interaction templates. You can also create your own custom interaction templates specifically for use with Teams conversations.

### Can I call a contact from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams?

[!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] has limited integration to Teams calling capabilities. It isn't possible to instantly start a VOIP call from the contact card or contact details window. However, when you view the contact details in the Teams desktop app, you can select the phone number field to dial that number if Teams is set up as your default dialing app on your device. To dial landlines or mobile phone numbers using PSTN, the traditional phone system, Teams requires that you have the Microsoft 365 Business Voice app. To learn more, see [What is Microsoft 365 Business Voice?](/MicrosoftTeams/business-voice/whats-business-voice).

### How do I view recent documents for a customer or vendor?

[!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] typically relates a contact with a customer or vendor record that in turn is related to business transaction records, such as sales quotes or purchase invoices. To view related documents for a contact, go to the details window for the contact, select the **Business Relation** field value or use the actions to navigate to the associated customer or vendor. On the customer or vendor page, expand the FactBox pane to reveal statistics for various documents that you can drill down into. Your experience can differ based on your customizations and personalization.

### How do I search for contacts using special characters?

You can enter search criteria using almost any unicode characters. However, [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] reserves the following symbols for other uses: **=**, **.**, **\***, and **@**. Using these symbols in your search terms might not return the expected results. If you don't see the expected results, enclose the symbols in your search terms in single quotes, for example, **Contoso'='2**.

### How can I search contacts stored in a different company?

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams can search for customers, vendors, and other contacts in one company at a time.  
To search for contacts stored in a different [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] company, open [Settings](across-teams-settings.md), then change the environment and company from there.

### Are [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts different than the ones in the Teams contacts screen?

Yes. Contacts stored in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] represent business contacts available to your organization. They're contacts with which you have an established and well-defined business relationship, or contacts that represent prospective customers. These contacts are typically external contacts. In comparison, the contacts shown in the Teams Calling contacts list are your own contacts. These contacts aren't necessarily shared with others in your organization, and they typically represent contacts internal to your organization.

### Does [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] synchronize contacts with Teams?

No. Contacts stored in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] remain separate from your contacts stored in Teams. There are currently no plans to synchronize the two lists together. When you use the Teams feature **Share someone's contact info** from the chat compose box, it has no relation to Business Central contacts.

### Can I search from my mobile device?

Contact search isn't available from Teams for iOS and Teams for Android at this time.

### Which permissions do I need for contact search?

To search for contacts, you need object-level permission to the **Contacts** table within the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] company being searched. To view the details window for a contact, you need at least read permission to the **Contact** page within the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] company, and any other related objects.

### Can I use contact search if I'm a delegated admin?

Yes. You can also look up contacts and contact details if you have a delegated admin role in an organization.

### Is contact search affected by API limits?

Yes. Searching for contacts from Teams is based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] v2.0 APIs and subject to any API limits that manage usage. Learn more about the limits in [Current API Limits](/dynamics-nav/api-reference/v2.0/dynamics-current-limits).

### Why does it sometimes ask me to set up the app?

After you sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams for the first time, the app will attempt to determine your preferred company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. If the app can't determine the company, you might have to go to the **Settings** and choose the company you wish to search in. This situation happens, for example, if you have access to multiple companies across environments in your organization. In this case, you'll have to choose a company before you can start searching.  

The app can also ask you to visit the **Settings** if you don't have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] subscription, there are no [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] environments, or your account doesn't have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] license.

### I'd like to search for items or records from other tables. Can I do this from Teams?

Searching in other tables isn't possible at this time. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams searches only in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts list, which can include vendors, customers, and other contacts.

If you'd like to see the search capabilities evolve to include other tables, we encourage our community to add an idea or vote for existing ideas at https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas.

## [Work with cards](#tab/cards)

### Which types of links does the app support?

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams reacts to most [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] Web client links. When the link refers to a single record on a page, the card will display fields for that record. The supported page types include: 

- Card pages, such as the Item card
- Document pages, such as the Sales Order document
- ListPlus pages that represent a single record composed of other records, such as a Bank Account Reconciliation statement
- Simple list pages where a record doesn't offer the ability to drill down into a separate details page, such as the Zip codes list

When pasting a link to the root Web client Url, such as https://businesscentral.dynamics.com, the card instead displays information to help new users get started with accessing [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### How do I delete a card I sent to a chat?

You can't delete a card that you've already sent to chat. But you can delete the entire message that the card is a part of.

As the message author, you can delete any messages you sent to chats with a person, group, or channel&mdash;unless your administrator has set up policies that prevent deleting messages. If you moderate a channel as a channel owner, your administrator might have also granted you permission to delete any messages in the channel, including those messages sent by other users.

Deleting a message that contains a card doesn't delete or affect any data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Do cards always show up-to-date information?

No. The field values on a card in Teams, including any images, are based on the data available when that card was sent to the chat. [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] cards don't automatically refresh in Teams. 

### Why don't cards show more information instead of just the page name and details button?

An administrator might have configured the Teams integration so that cards don't show data about records. For more information, see [Show or hide record data on cards](admin-teams-integration.md#show-or-hide-record-data-on-cards).

### Will others see my card if they don't have the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams? 

When you compose and send a message to chat that includes a card, all users will see the card&mdash;even if they haven't installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams.

### How do I find out which company a card in Teams belongs to?

If you work across [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] companies, talk to your administrator about enabling a company badge for each company. When enabled, this eye-catching hint appears in any details window inside Teams, and displays the company and environment that record belongs to. To learn how to set up company badge, see [Display a company badge](admin-company-information.md#badge).

## [Work with card details](#tab/carddetails)

### Where is the save button in the details window in Teams?

[!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically saves changes you make to any field as soon as you leave the field. To leave a field, click/tap anywhere outside the field or use the Tab key to move to the next field. When data appears in a dialog within the details window, you might need to choose the **OK** button to have [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] save your changes.

### If I choose to view details for a card, will other users see my details window?

No. While everyone in the chat or meeting can view the card itself, the details window only appears for you on your device when you choose **Details**. Other users must choose **Details** if they would like to view the details window on their device.

### Can I start a Teams call from the details window in Teams?

Yes. If you're using the Teams desktop app, start a call by choosing the linked number in a phone number field, like the **Mobile Phone No.** field on the **Contact** card. Teams must be your designated dialing app.

To call local or international landlines and mobile phones, Teams requires that you have a Business Voice license for enterprise calling. Also, you must set up Teams as your call solution. To learn more, see [Plan your Teams voice solution](/microsoftteams/cloud-voice-landing-page) in the Teams documentation.

### Can I print documents from the details window in Teams?

Yes. You print reports and other documents using standard [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] printing functionality and any cloud-enabled printer configured in the **Printer Management** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can't print from Teams to local printers known to your client device, such as printers that you'd typically print to from your browser. For this reason, you can't print from the report preview window, but only from the main report request page, directly to your cloud printers.

For more information about setting up cloud printers, see [Set Up Printers](ui-specify-printer-selection-reports.md).

### Can I access the camera from the details window in Teams?

Yes. Any [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] features in the details window that use the camera are available on all Teams clients.

### <a name="location"></a>Can I access my location from the details window in Teams?

If you're using functionality in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] that accesses your current location coordinates, such as with maps, you must use Teams in the browser or the Teams mobile app. Location isn't available when using the Teams desktop app.

### How do I open the details in a new window?

Popping out the details window as a separate window is useful for multi-tasking or for being able to work with business data while still being able to use Teams chat and other Teams functions. To open details in its own window, choose **Open in browser** from the ellipse menu (**...**) in the upper right corner of the window.

## [Collaborate with guests](#tab/collaborating)

### Can I share cards with users outside my organization?

Yes. When you compose and send a message that includes a card, all recipients in the chat will see the card&mdash;even if they're guests or external to your organization. Guests can also open the details window if they've been granted permissions to access that data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Is the experience any different for users that are guests?

Yes. Inviting guest users from outside your organization to participate in chat or a channel gives them a similar, but not identical experience compared to users within your organization. When a guest receives a message that includes a card, they can view it. Guests can also open the details page if they have permission to access that data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] and assigned a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] license within your organization.

Choosing the details link on any Business Central card will sign you in to the environment from which the card was shared, assuming you have permission to the environment.

Guest users aren't allowed to use contact search because it's bound to the original tenant and we don't currently support such a delegated scenario.

When a guest composes a message, links to their [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] or yours won't expand into cards.

To learn about other similarities and differences between guests and team members, go to [Guest experience in Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/guest-experience) in the Teams documentation.

### How does a guest user install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app? 

Guests don't have access to the app marketplace to install apps themselves. However, the app can be automatically installed for them based on your organization's policies. Another way for a guest user to install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app is when they receive a chat message that includes a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] card. In this case, the user chooses the **Details** button or the menu on the card, then installs the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for use with your organization. After installing the app, a user doesn't automatically receive any permissions to access data from your [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

## [Share to Teams](#tab/share)

### Does Share to Teams send a compact card? 

Yes. The link will automatically expand into a card if you have the Business Central app for Teams installed. 

### Will recipients receive the message from me or from a Business Central service account? 

When you use Share to Teams, the message is sent to a person, group, or channel, similar to if you had sent the message yourself from within Microsoft Teams. Recipients see the message from you on their preferred Teams client, and can react and respond as they normally would to a message from you. 

### Is Share to Teams available in Business Central on premises? 

No. Similar to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, this feature is only available for the web client in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] online. There are no plans to support [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] deployment types&mdash;like on-premises, hybrid cloud, or private cloud&mdash;that Microsoft doesn't host or manage directly.

### Does Share to Teams grant permissions to recipients? 

No. When you share with a person, group, or channel, permissions are unaffected. Users who already have permission to view the page and data targeted by the link can do so. Users who don't have permission to view that page and data, or don't have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] license, are shown an error message. 
 
### Must I have the Teams desktop app installed to use Share to Teams? 

No. All you need is a valid account that has access to Microsoft Teams. 

### Is Share to Teams available in all Business Central clients? 

At this time, Share to Teams is available in the desktop web client, in the details window in Teams, and when opening a page in a new window from the Outlook add-in.

### Where do I find Share to Teams in Business Central? 

The **Share to Teams action** can be found in the **Share** menu on all pages, such as card and document pages, list or worksheet pages, including custom pages. The action isn't available on dialog boxes or pages shown as dialog boxes, such as lookup pages or wizards.

# Design Details: Expected Cost Posting
Expected costs represent the estimation of, for example, a purchased item’s cost that you record before you receive the invoice for the item.  

 You can post expected cost to inventory and to the general ledger. When you post a quantity that is only received or shipped but not invoiced, then a value entry is created with the expected cost. This expected cost affects the inventory value, but is not posted to the general ledger unless you set up the system up to do so.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Expected costs are only managed for item transactions. Expected costs are not for immaterial transaction types, such as capacity and item charges.  

 If only the quantity part of an inventory increase has been posted, then the inventory value in the general ledger does not change unless you have selected the **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** check box on the **Inventory Setup** page. In that case, the expected cost is posted to interim accounts at the time of receipt. After the receipt has been fully invoiced, the interim accounts are then balanced and the actual cost is posted to the inventory account.  

 To support reconciliation and traceability work, the invoiced value entry shows the expected cost amount that has been posted to balance the interim accounts.  

## Prerequisites for posting expected costs

To make it possible to post expected costs you need to do the following:
1. On the **Inventory Setup** page, select the **Automatic Cost Posting** check box and the **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** check box.
2. Set up which interim accounts to use during the expected cost posting process.  

  On the **Inventory Posting Setup** page, verify the **Inventory Account** and the **Inventory Account (Interim)** fields for the **Location Code and Invt. Posting Group Code** of the item you will be purchasing. To learn more about these accounts see [Design Details - Accounts in the General Ledger](design-details-accounts-in-the-general-ledger.md).
3. On the **General Posting Setup** page, verify the **Invt. Accrual Acc. (Interim)** field for the **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** and the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** you will be using.
4. When you create a purchase order the default is that the **Vendor Invoice No.** field is required. You need to turn that off on the **Purchase & Payables Setup** page, by unselecting the **Ext. Doc. No. Mandatory** field.

## Example  

> [!NOTE]  
> The account numbers used in this example are there for reference only, and will be different in your system. Set them up as directed in the Prerequisites above.

You post a purchase order as received. The expected cost is LCY 95.00.

|01-01-20|Inventory Account (Interim)|2131|95.00|1|  

 At a later date, you post the purchase order as invoiced. The invoiced cost is LCY 100.00.

# Customizing Business Central online using apps

You can change [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online by installing apps that add functionality, changes behavior, or gives you access to new online services, for example. These apps are also called *extensions* because they *extend* [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Manage apps

When you first launch [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], some apps are already installed for you. Over time, more apps will be made available to you, and you can then choose if you want to use the app or not.

For example, Microsoft provides an app that lets you integrate with PayPal Payments Standard. This extension is installed by default. But, an extension that offers integration with another payment service might come along. In that case, you can install the new extension and then choose which to use.  

To use an app, you must have the permissions to the installed objects.

To install or uninstall apps from AppSource or add per-tenant extensions, you must have the right permissions. You must either be a member of the **D365 Extension Mgt.** user group, or you must have the **EXTEN. MGT. - ADMIN** permission set explicitly. If you're an administrator, you can assign user groups and permissions to other users in your company. Learn more in [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you cannot upload per-tenant extensions or install AppSource apps through the **Extension Management** page. You cannot install AppSource apps on-premises, including in Docker-based deployments.

You manage the apps on the **Extension Management** page. You can access this page from Home. Alternatively, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") in the top right corner, enter **Extension**, and then choose the related link. Learn more in [Install and Uninstall apps](ui-extensions-install-uninstall.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If you think you should have access to an app but you cannot find its functionality, check the **Extension Management** page - if the app is not listed there, you can install it as described in the following section.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Sign in to [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) using the email account that you use for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. Use the same email account for other services and products for a smooth experience.  

You can also get to AppSource from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On the **Extension Management** page, you can see the apps that are currently installed, and you can open the **Microsoft AppSource Apps** page that shows the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] apps that are currently available in AppSource. If you choose the **View AppSource** action, you're taken to [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). Learn more in [Manage AppSource apps](admin-manage-appsource-apps.md).

If you choose an app, you can read about what the app does, and you can access Help for the app to learn more. When you choose to get an app, you must agree to the terms of use. If you get the app from the AppSource website, sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to complete the installation.  

When you install an app, you might have to set it up, such as specifying an account for use with the **PayPal Payments Standard for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** extension. Other apps add fields to an existing page, or they add a new page, for example.

If you uninstall an app, and you then change your mind, you can install it again. When you uninstall an app, your data is preserved. If you install the app again, it's still available. There are some apps that are required, and you can't uninstall them from the **Extension Management** page.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can keep an eye out for new apps from Microsoft and other suppliers at [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?product=dynamics-365%3Bdynamics-365-business-central&page=1).

## Understanding the risks of installing apps

[!INCLUDE [ui-extensions-risk-install-apps](includes/ui-extensions-risk-install-apps.md)]

## Apps and data transfer

When apps communicate with other services, they might transfer data out of the geography of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment. Examples of such apps include banking, payment, payroll, and forecasting services.

The same is true for the base application, such as the following capabilities:

* Cash Flow Forecast
* Document Exchange Service
* Dataverse connections
* OCR Service
* Online Map
* EU VAT Reg. No. Service

## Connect your business

Starting in 2022 release wave 2, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online environments can list one or more apps on the **Connectivity Apps** and **Banking Apps** pages. These apps can connect your business to external services that increase productivity by automating processes. For example, you can connect to your banks and automatically import bank transactions. The apps are easy to install and set up directly from this page. Choose an app to learn more about capabilities and pricing.  

View the list of suggested apps by choosing the **Connectivity Apps** action in the **Extension Management** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> The first person to open the **Connectivity Apps** page must allow the extension to connect to an external service. Allow the connection once or always. If you choose to block the connection, you must find the relevant apps on AppSource. If you allow the connection once or always, be aware that your information might be shared with third parties. Learn more in the section [Understanding the risks of installing apps](#understanding-the-risks-of-installing-apps).

This external service generates a list of relevant apps based on your country or region

## Recommended apps

Microsoft partners and resellers can create an app that they can use to compile lists of apps that they often recommend to their customers. If they do, and they deployed the app to your tenant, the apps are available on the **Recommended Apps** page. There you can read about each app and decide whether to install them.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are a Microsoft partner or reseller, and you're interested in providing a list of recommended apps, see [Recommend Apps from AppSource](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/recommend-apps) in the administration content.

# Unsubscribe or Remove [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

If you want to stop using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can close your account or get the license removed from your account. The steps to take are different if you're currently using the free trial, or if you have a subscription.  

If you want to end a trial, your administrator can learn more about the different types of trials and how to end them [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/trials-subscriptions)  

If you want to end a subscription, your administrator must remove the subscription in the Microsoft 365 admin center. For more information, see [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/trials-subscriptions?#removing-a-subscription).  

> [!TIP]
> We recommend that you export any data before you close your account.

You can read about how to export data to Excel in the [Exporting Data to Other Finance Systems](about-export-data.md#exporting-data-to-other-finance-systems). If you would rather export all data to an Azure storage container, your Microsoft 365 administrator can do that in the admin center. For more information, see [Exporting Databases in the Admin Center](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-database-export).  

## Removing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from your app launcher

If you want to hide [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from your app launcher, you can unpin it. No data is lost, and the step doesn't cancel your subscription.

# Ad-hoc analyses in purchasing

This article explains how to analyze purchasing data from list pages and queries using the **Data Analysis** feature. The feature lets you analyze data directly from the page, without having to run a report or open another application, such as Excel. Data Analysis provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "My vendors," or "Purchasing statistics," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages for ad-hoc analysis of purchase processes:

- [Purchase Orders](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9307&layout=analysis)
- [Purchase lines](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=518&layout=analysis)
- [Posted Purchase Invoices](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=146&layout=analysis)
- [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29&layout=analysis)
- [General Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=20&layout=analysis)

## Ad-hoc analysis scenarios for purchasing

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report
- If there isn't a report for your specific needs
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of purchasing scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Example: goods received, not invoiced (GRNI) overview

To create a goods received, not invoiced (GRNI) overview across vendors, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Purchase lines](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=518) list page.
1. Personalize the page to add the **Amount Received Not Invoiced** field. To personalize the page, choose **Settings**, and then **Personalize**.
1. Choose :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: to turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. In the **Additional Filters** menu (located below the **Columns** menu on the right), set the following filters:
    - **Type = Item**
    - **Amt. Rec. Not Invoiced (LCY) > 0**. 
1. Drag the **Vendor No.**, **Document No.**, and **No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area. Drag the fields in that order.
1. Add the **Amt. Rec. Not Invoiced (LCY)** field to include it on the overview.
1. To do the analysis for a given year or quarter, apply a filter in the **Analysis Filters** menu. The menu is on the right of the page, just below the **Columns** menu.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Goods Received, Not Invoiced (GRNI)**, or something that describes this analysis.

## Example: finance (accounts payable)

To see what you owe your vendors, maybe broken down into time intervals for when amounts are due, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29&layout=analysis) list page, and turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle (located above the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Vendor Name**, **Document Type**, and **Document No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area, and then drag the **Remaining Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. Drag the **Due Date Year** and **Due Date Month** fields to the **Column Labels** area. Drag the fields in that order.
1. To do the analysis for a given year or quarter, apply a filter in the **Analysis Filters** menu (located below the **Columns** menu on the right).
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Aged Payable Accounts by Month**, or something that describes this analysis.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

## Example: finance (accounts payable) - vendor ledger entries on hold

To see vendor ledger entries on hold, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29&layout=analysis) list page, and turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle (located above the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Vendor Name**, **Document Type**, and **Document No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area, and then drag the **Remaining Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. Drag the **On Hold** field to the **Column Labels** area.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Payments On Hold**, or something that describes this analysis.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on purchasing

When you post a purchase document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the vendor's account, general ledger (G/L), item ledger entries, and resource ledger entries:

- For each purchase document, a purchase entry is created in the **G/L Entry** table. An entry is also created in the vendor's account in the **Supplier Ledger Entry** table, and a G/L entry is created in the relevant payables account. In addition, posting the purchase might result in a value-added tax (VAT) entry and a G/L entry for the discount amount.

- For each purchase line, as applicable, entries are created in the:
  - **Item Ledger Entry** table, if the purchase line is of the Item type.
  - **G/L Entry** table, if the purchase line is of the G/L Account type.
  - **Resource Ledger Entry** table, if the purchase line is of the Resource type.
- In addition, purchase documents are always recorded in the **Purch. Recpt. Header** and **Purch. Inv. Header** tables.

To learn more, go to [Posting purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md#posting-purchases).

# Field Mapping When Importing SEPA CAMT Files

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the regional SEPA standards (Single Euro Payments Area) for importing SEPA bank statements (CAMT format). For more information, see [Use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md).  

 The SEPA CAMT standard itself has local variations. Therefore, you may have to modify the generic data exchange definition (represented by the **SEPA CAMT** code on the **Data Exchange Definitions** page) to adapt it to a local variation of the standard. The following tables show the element-to-field mapping for tables 81, 273, and 274 in the SEPA CAMT implementation in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

 For information about creating or adjusting a data exchange definition, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

## CAMT data mapping to fields in the General Journal table (81)  

|Element Path|Message Element|Data Type|Description|Negative-Sign Identifier|Field No.|Field Name|

 Elements in the **Ntry** node that are imported into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] but not mapped to any fields are stored in the **Posting Exch. Column Def** table. Users can view these elements from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal**, **Payment Application**, and **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** pages by choosing the **Bank Statement Line Details** action. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In an import of CAMT bank statements, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] expects each transaction to be unique, which means that the **Transaction ID** field that comes from the *Stmt/Ntry/NtryDtls/TxDtls/Refs/EndToEndId* tag in the CAMT file, must be unique within the open bank account reconciliation. If the information is not present, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ignores the payment. If an earlier bank reconciliation on the same bank account was posted with the same transaction ID as on the current import, the current transaction will not automatically reconcile but can still be imported.

title: Check amounts on purchase invoices and credit memos
description: You can verify that the total amount on purchase invoices and credit memos equals the total amounts, including VAT, on the lines.

# Check amounts on purchase invoices and credit memos

> [!NOTE]
> Businesses around the world can benefit from this functionality, so in 2025 release wave 1 we moved it out of the Dutch version and made it available to everyone.

Before posting a purchase invoice or credit memo, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks whether the amount including VAT and the VAT amount on the document equals the total amount on the purchase lines. This check requires that you fill in the **Doc. Amount Incl. VAT** and **Doc. Amount VAT** fields on the purchase invoice or credit memo.  

When the document has only one purchase line, or all lines are subject to the same VAT percentage, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the value in the **Doc. Amount VAT** field when you add purchase lines and fill in the **Doc. Amount Incl. VAT** field. If there are several lines with different VAT percentages, you must manually enter the value in the **Doc. Amount VAT** field.  

By default, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks the total amounts. If you prefer that it doesn't, you can turn off the **Check Doc. Total Amounts** toggle on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page.  

If the total amount on the document differs from the total amount of its lines, you can add a few values to the page that can help you find out why. You can add the total amount, total base amount, total VAT amount, and total amount including VAT values. The values display at the bottom of the document. To avoid clutter on the page during daily work, these values are hidden. To add these values to the document, turn on the **Show Totals on Purch. Inv.-CM.** toggle on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you turn on this feature, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recalculates totals on all purchase invoices and credit memos which, depending on the number of documents, might take some time.
>
> You can't turn on this feature if you have purchase invoices or credit memos that don't have lines, or where a quantity isn't specified on the lines.

title: Walkthrough - Planning Supplies Manually
description: This walkthrough demonstrates the process of planning supply orders to fulfill new demand including planning a purchase, transfer, and production order.

# Walkthrough: Planning Supplies Manually

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

This walkthrough demonstrates the process of planning supply orders to fulfill new demand. You can initiate supply planning at fixed intervals, for example, every morning or every Monday, or when you are notified by sales or production, depending on the type of demand. In this walkthrough you will use the **Order Planning** page, a simple supply planning tool that is based on manual decision-making instead of parameter-based automatic planning.  

## About This Walkthrough  
 This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

-   Planning a purchase order for manufacturing components.  
-   Planning a transfer order to fulfill sales demand.  
-   Planning a production order for a multilevel item.  

## Roles  
 This walkthrough demonstrates tasks performed by the following user roles:  

-   Production Planner  
-   Purchasing Agent  
-   Sales Order Processor  

## Prerequisites  
 Before you begin this walkthrough, you must install the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The following modifications must be made to the database:  

-   Delete all existing sales orders for bicycles.  
-   Create one sales order for 10 bicycles at EAST location.  
-   Delete all planned and firm planned production orders. Do not delete started orders with entries that are already posted.  

 As a rule, use the suggested data in this walkthrough because this data has the necessary records.  

## Story  
 Eduardo, the Production Planner of a small manufacturing company, is about to plan production and purchase orders to fulfill new sales demand.  

 Because the products have few BOM levels and the flow of orders is relatively low, Eduardo uses the **Order Planning** page to manually create supply orders, one product level at a time.  

 In a more complex manufacturing environment, the planning worksheet is used to plan supply based on item parameters such as rescheduling period, safety lead time, reorder point, and batch calculations of consolidated demand from all product levels.  

## Setting Up the Sample Data  
 The standard CRONUS demonstration company currently has lots of unplanned demand. During the different planning tasks in this walkthrough, you will have to deviate from the realistic business flow by ignoring demand with close due dates and instead use demand with later due dates.  

## Use the Order Planning Page  

The **Order Planning** page can be accessed from several different locations:  

-   Manufacturing, Planning  
-   Sales & Marketing, Order Processing  
-   Purchase, Planning  
-   In addition, you can open this page for a specific production order by choosing the **Planning** action.

### To use the Order Planning page  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Order Planning**, and then choose the related link.  

     When the **Order Planning** page first opens, a plan must be calculated to show the new demand since it was last calculated.  

2.  Choose the **Calculate Plan** action.  

     The planning system analyzes any new demand that has been introduced, such as new sales, changed sales, or production orders.  

     Based on total availability, the quantity needed for each demand line is calculated. This calculation is performed order-by-order. This means that the order which includes the demand line with the earliest due date or shipment date will be calculated first. After that, additional demand lines will be calculated in the same order, regardless of the due date or shipment date.  

3.  Be sure that the **Order Planning** page is maximized and that column fields are resized to show all the default field names.  

     When the calculation is completed, the page displays all unfulfilled demand as collapsed order header lines sorted by earliest demand date.  

     Notice that CRONUS has several orders with unfulfilled demand. Each bold planning line represents an order, sales order, or production order, including at least one order line with insufficient availability.  

4.  In the **Show Demand As** field, select the **All Demand** filter.  

     With the **Demand Type** field, you can choose which order types that you want to display.  

     Orders that do not have availability problems are not shown. If no orders exist when a plan is calculated, a message will display and no planning lines will appear.  

## Planning a Purchase Order to Fulfill Component Demand  
 In this procedure, you create a purchase order for needed manufacturing components.  

### To plan a purchase order to fulfill component need in production  

1.  Expand the first line (choose the + symbol).  
2.  Choose the first demand line, with item **LSU-15**, and then choose the **Show Document** action.  
3.  Close the opened production order to return to the **Order Planning** page.  
4.  In the **Replenishment System** field, select **Purchase**.  

     The default value is from the item card, or SKU card, but you can change it to one of the following options:  

    -   **Purchase** – To create a purchase order.  
    -   **Transfer** – To create a transfer order.  
    -   **Prod. Order** – To create a production order.  

5.  In the **Supply From** field, select one of the following options according to the selected replenishment system:  

    -   **Vendor** – For purchases  
    -   **Location** – For transfers  

     If the field is not filled in, an error message will display when you try to create the supply orders.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the components have a default vendor number set up on the item cards, the lines will be preset.  

6.  Choose the **Supply From**  field.  
7.  On the **Item Vendor Catalogue** page, choose the **New** action, and then select vendor **30000**.  
8.  Choose the **OK** button to return to the **Order Planning** page.  
9. Copy vendor **30000** to the other lines for loudspeaker components on this production order.  

     You are now ready to create a purchase order.  

10. Choose the **Make Orders** action. The **Make Supply Orders** page opens.  
11. On the **Order Planning** FastTab, in the **Make Orders for** field, choose the **Active Order** option.  
12. On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Create Purchase Order** field, choose the **Make Purch. Order** option.  
13. Choose the **OK** button to create purchase orders for all the components of the order.  

     The purchase orders are now created and saved as the last orders in the list of purchase orders.  

## Planning a Transfer Order to Fulfill Sales Demand  
 In this procedure, you will plan for demand from a sales order. Demand lines represent sales lines and not component lines, as in production demand.  

### To plan a transfer order to fulfill sales demand  

1.  Move the pointer to the planning line for order **2008**.  
2.  Expand the line and move the pointer to the demand line.  

     Sales order **2008** is for ten loudspeakers, item **LS-120**, ordered by John Haddock Insurance Co.  

     The item's defined replenishment system and default vendor will display.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  At the bottom of the page, there are four information fields. In the **Earliest Date Available** field, the ten pieces that are needed will be available, on an inbound supply order, nine days later than the current due date. If this is too late for the customer, the **Available for Transfer** field shows 13 pieces of the item at another location. You will want to plan for this stock.  

3.  Choose the **Available for Transfer** field to open the **Get Alternative Supply** page.  
4.  Choose the **OK** button to book the ten items that are available.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  In the demand line, the suggested purchase has been exchanged with a transfer from MAIN location. The **Make Orders** function creates a transfer order from MAIN to the demanded location. The **Substitutes Exists** field works in the same way.  

5.  Choose the **Make Orders** action. The **Make Supply Orders** page opens.  
6.  On the **Order Planning** FastTab, in the **Make Orders for** field, choose the **The Active Order** option.  
7.  On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Create Transfer Order** field, select the **Make Trans. Orders** option.  
8.  Choose the **OK** button to create the transfer order to supply the sales order.  

     The transfer order is now created and saved in the list as the last order in the list of open transfer orders.  

## Planning a Multilevel Production Order to Fulfill Sales Demand  
 In this procedure, you will plan to fulfill sales demand for a produced item with multiple product levels, each creating dependent production demand.  

### To plan multilevel production to fulfill sales demand  

1.  Select the planning line with sales demand for order **1001**, created earlier as prerequisite data.  

     This demand is a sales line, but the item has a defined replenishment system of **Prod. Order**. Proceed to add an extra bell to the component need of each bicycle.  

2.  Choose the **Components** action to open the **Planning Components** page.  
3.  On the line with the Bell item, change the **Quantity per** field from **1** to **2**.  
4.  On the **Order Planning** page, consider your planning alternatives. In this case, you have no alternative means of supply, no transfer, substitute, or later delivery. You must create the suggested supply order, a production order.  
5.  Choose the **Make Orders** action to create the production order.  

     On the **Order Planning** page, notice that the planning line for sales order **1001** no longer exists and that the initial sales demand has been covered.  

6.  Close the **Order Planning** page.  

     Now, you could choose to stay in this view and complete all the planning tasks. Instead, you will now take on the Production Planner role by going to the production order that you just created and access the **Order Planning** page.  

 As a production planner you now must plan a specific production order.  

### To plan a specific production order  

1.  Open the production order **101001**, for ten bicycles, that you just created by using the **Make Orders** function.  
2.  Open the **Prod. Order Components** page to check that the extra bell is reflected on the production order.  
3.  Choose the **Planning** action.  

     The **Order Planning** page opens in a view that is always filtered on the specific production demand. Sales demand is not displayed. You must calculate a plan before you can see any additional demand.  

4.  Choose the **Calculate Plan** action.  

     Notice that four new production orders appear as unplanned production demand derived from order **101001**. The new lines represent new production demand from the subassemblies that must be created to produce the order.  

5.  Choose the **Expand All** action to get an overview of all the production demand for the production orders.  

     To provide additional information about the demand lines, you may want to add the **Demand Quantity** and **Demand Qty. Available** fields to your view.  

     Now you must supply ten of each component.  

     Note that four of the demand lines have replenishment system Prod. Order. These four subassemblies represent the second product level of the bicycle.  

     The default replenishment settings are already filled in and you can proceed to make orders.  

6.  Choose the **Make Orders** action.  

     Before you choose the **OK** button, notice the text on the **Order Planning** FastTab. This text is important because you know that the bicycle has several produced components, subassemblies, in its product structure that might be in demand when you create this production order.  

7.  On the **Make Supply Order** page, in the **Make Orders for** field, choose the **All Lines** option, and then choose the **OK** button to create production orders for the second product level of the order.  

     Note that the top-level production demand for production order 101001 no longer exists. This means that the initial production demand for subassemblies has been planned for.  

     On the **Order Planning** page, you calculate a plan again in order to plan the bicycle structure.  

8.  Choose the **Calculate Plan** action to recalculate the plan as instructed by the embedded Help text.  

     The two new lines represent additional production demand derived from the subassemblies planned in the previous steps. It is suggested that you make two production orders to supply the wheel hubs, one for 10 front hubs and one for 10 back hubs.  

9. Choose the **Expand All** action to get an overview of all the demand for the two production orders.  

     The suggested supply plan indicates that a total of four purchase orders will be created for the components. You decide to make the proposed orders.  

10. Choose the **Make Orders** action.  
11. In the **Make Orders for** field, select the **All Lines** option, and then choose the **OK** button. Check if additional demand exists for the production of the parent item, the bicycle, which is being sold on sales order 1001.  
12. Choose the **Calculate Plan** action.  

     The message indicates that all required items are now supplied. Verify the firm planned production orders that are created.  

13. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Orders**, and then choose the related link.  

     On the **Firm Planned Prod. Orders** page review how start times and end times of individual orders are scheduled according to the product structure. The lowest-level components are produced first. Therefore, you must plan multilevel orders as demonstrated in this planning workflow.

# Administration Tasks

Central administration tasks are usually performed by one role in the company. The scope of these tasks can depend on the company's size and the administrator's job responsibilities. These tasks can include managing database synchronization of job and email queues, setting up users, and customizing the user interface.  

Entering the correct setup values from the start is important to the success of any new business software. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a number of setup guides that help you set up core data. For more information, see [Setting Up Business Central](setup.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the data migration tools to migrate existing data to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. Alternatively, you can set up a new company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with configuration packages to shorten deployment times, improve quality of implementation, introduce a repeatable approach to implementations, and enhance productivity by automating and simplifying recurring tasks. For more information, see [Migrate On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data).

You can support your setup decisions with some general recommendations for selected setup fields that are known to potentially cause the solution to be inefficient if defined incorrectly.  

A super user or an administrator can set up the Data Exchange Framework to enable users to export and import data in bank and payroll files, for example for various cash management processes. For more information, see [Exchanging Data Electronically](across-data-exchange.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Copilot data movement across geographies

Although Copilot in Business Central is available in all geographic areas where Business Central online is available, it requires Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, which is available only in specific regions.  

Depending on where your environment is hosted, you might need to allow data to move outside of your primary data residency to an Azure OpenAI endpoint located in another geography. You provide consent in the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. If you don't provide consent, Copilot won't be available to your organization. Learn how to provide consent in [Allow data movement across geographies](enable-ai.md#allow-data-movement-across-geographies).

Individual Copilot features might not be available in all geographies. Learn more about geographic and language availability at [Copilot international availability](https://aka.ms/bapcopilot-intl-report-external). Copilot and generative AI features from non-Microsoft publishers, such as those originating from customizations or AppSource apps you install, each define their own specific Azure OpenAI Service regions. Consult with the extension publisher to understand which regional Azure services are used by the extension.

## How data movement across geographies works

When you use Copilot, your inputs (prompts) and outputs (results), including any personal data, might move outside of your geography to the location where the Azure OpenAI Service endpoint is hosted. We might store prompt and output data for up to 24 hours to monitor for abuse, but we don't look at it unless our automated systems flag it for review. We don't use your data to train, retrain, or improve Azure OpenAI Service foundation models. Learn more at [Abuse Monitoring](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/abuse-monitoring).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your Business Central environment is hosted in the EU Data Boundary, we use an Azure OpenAI endpoint in the same boundary. Learn more: [EU Data Boundary countries and datacenter locations](/privacy/eudb/eu-data-boundary-learn#eu-data-boundary-countries-and-datacenter-locations)

The following table describes when and how data can move across geographies for Copilot in Business Central.

title: Handling Lot Sizes

# Handling Lot Sizes in Production
In terms of quantity, the number of items you produce in a production operation might not correlate to how sell them. For example, you might produce hundreds of items in a single lot, but sell each item individually. When you configure your production routes and bills of materials (BOMs), there are few nuances you should consider with regards to lot sizes. This topic describes how lot sizes impact cost calculations and resource planning.

## Units of Measure in Production Bill of Materials
Although you specify the base unit of measure (UOM) for an item, your BOM might use a different UOM for the finished product. For example, the base UOM for an item might be PCS, but your BOM might call for pallet or ton. This comes in handy when your machines or raw components dictate the volume. For example, you probably wouldn't want to bake a single muffin because it is difficult to use a portion of an egg. Instead, you bake a batch of muffins to reduce waste. For more information, see [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).

## Lot size on routing lines
From a routing perspective, you can specify a lot size on routing lines to align with the capacity of the machines that produce the items. The run time on routing lines is reduced proportionally to the lot size. 

This works well when the quantity on a production order is a factor of the lot size on the route. For example, if your baking sheet can hold 10 muffins, you should bake 10, 20, 30, and so on, and not 5 nor 15.  This is much less of an issue if you are dealing with large quantities.

Lot size is also popular in manufacturing environments where output is measured as quantity you can make during fixed amount of time. Example, if Volume per 9 hour shift is 25000 cubic feet, you can set run time as 9 hours and lot size as 25000.
The production order quantity becomes less important as on the production order the run time gets calculated as the Run time / Lot size to get the run time per piece.
 
> [!NOTE]
> The value defined in Lot size doesn't have impact on time specified in **Setup Time** field of the routing line. The setup will happen only one time, even if there are several lots. For example, so that you don’t need to warm the oven for the second lot of muffins. For more information, see [Create Routings](production-how-to-create-routings.md).

## Lot Sizes for Items and Stockkeeping Units
Lot sizes defined for routings are not the same as lot sizes for items or stockkeeping units. Those values are used for a different purpose, and do not affect production capacity. 

## Lot size on item and stockkeeping units
For items and stockkeeping units, lot sizes have the following effects on cost calculation and supply planning:

* For standard cost calculation, if you enable **Cost Incl Setup** on the **Manufacturing Setup** page, the cost for the setup is added to the standard cost. If you specify a lot size, the setup cost for routing operation will be reduced according to one lot size. For example, if your lot size defined on item card is 10, and it takes 15 minutes to heat the oven, the cost of the fuel will be allocated to the 10 muffins as roughly 1.5 minutes. 

> [!NOTE]
> Setup costs are handled differently from a standard cost and capacity allocation perspectives. If produced quantity doesn't match lot size defined in the item card that will lead to variation. For more information, see [Managing Inventory Costs](finance-manage-inventory-costs.md). <!--not sure that I got this part right seems to repeat the first example.-->

For supply planning, the lot size setting on items works with the **Default Dampener %** on the **Manufacturing Setup** page. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will ignore changes in demand that are below the dampener percentage and will not create planning suggestions. For example, 15 is specified in the Default Dampener % field, and we have a production order for 20 muffins to feed 20 guests, but one guest cannot attend. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will ignore the single missing guest because it's only 10% of the lot size 10 defined on the item. However, if two guests cannot make it, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest that we reduce the order quantity because two is 20% of the lot size. For more information about planning, see [Planning](production-planning.md).

# Set up projects, prices, and project posting groups

As a project manager, you can set up each of the projects that you manage in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Use the **Project Setup** page to define how you'll use project features.

For each project, specify various information:

* Prices for project items
* Project resources
* Project G/L accounts
* Project posting groups (required)

## To set general information for projects

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The **Apply Usage Link by Default** toggle on the **Projects Setup** page indicates whether project ledger entries are linked to project planning lines by default. Turn on the toggle to apply this setting to all new projects. You can enable or disable project usage tracking for a specific project by turning the **Apply Usage Link** toggle on or off on the **Project Card** page. The **Apply Usage Link** toggle also activates warehouse handling, planning, assembly-to-order, item tracking, and reservation capabilities for project.

### To set up project usage tracking

When you're working on a project, you might want to know how your usage is tracking against your plan. To explore usage, you can create a link between your project planning lines and the actual usage. The link lets you track your costs and understand how much work remains. By default, the project planning line type is **Budget**, but using the line type **Both Budget and Billable** has similar effects.

After you set up usage tracking by turning on the **Apply Usage Link by Default** toggle, you can review information on the project planning line. For example, you can set the quantity of the resource, item, or general ledger account. You can also set the quantity to transfer to the project journal. The **Remaining Quantity** field on the project planning line shows what remains to transfer and post to the project journal.

>[!NOTE]
> If the **Apply Usage Link** is chosen on the project, and the **Line Type** field on the project journal line or purchase line is **Billable**, new project planning lines of the line type **Both Budget and Billable** are created when you post the project journal or purchase document.  
>
> For more information, see [Record Usage for Projects](projects-how-record-job-usage.md) and [Manage Project Supplies](projects-how-manage-project-supplies.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't specify a value in the **Line Type** field on the project journal line or purchase line, project planning lines aren't created when you post the project journal or purchase document.

### Invoice multiple customers for project tasks

When projects involve multiple customers, billing the right customers for the right tasks can be challenging. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes billing less complex by letting you specify the bill-to and sell-to customers on each project task line, so you can automatically generate invoices for the correct customers.  Use the **Default Task Billing Method** field to specify whether you're billing one customer, or multiple customers by default. You can change task billing method for a specific project by using the **Task Billing Method** field on the **Project Card** page. To learn more about invoicing multiple customers, go to [Invoice one or more customers for project tasks](projects-how-create-jobs.md#invoice-one-or-more-customers-for-project-tasks).

### Synchronize the cost of used items

The cost of an item (inventory value) that you purchase and later use in project might change during its lifetime. For example, because a freight cost is added to its purchase cost after you post the usage of the item.

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can manually or automatically adjust item costs. The adjustment is reflected in the value entries and general ledger. To learn more, go to [Managing Inventory Cost](finance-manage-inventory-costs.md)

In relation to projects, you also have options for how to reflect those adjustments.

To ensure that cost changes automatically adjust in a project each time the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job is run, turn on the **Automatic Update Project Item Cost** toggle.

If you keep it off, remember to run the **Update Job Project Cost** task manually or by using a job queue entry.

## To set up prices for resources, items, and general ledger accounts for projects

> [!NOTE]
> In 2020 release wave 2, we released new processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you are using the new experience depends on whether your administrator has enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. For more information, see [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

You can set up prices for the items, resources, and general ledger accounts related to a project. 

#### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the project, and then choose the **Resource**, **Item**, or **G/L Account** action.
3. On the **Project Resource Prices**, **Project Item Prices**, or **Project G/L Account Prices** pages, fill in the fields as necessary.

When you choose a resource, item, or general ledger account for a project, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses information in the optional fields on project planning lines and project journals. The following table explains how.

|Column1  |Column2  |
|---------|---------|
|**Project Items**|The **Project Task No.**, **Currency Code**, and **Line Discount %** fields. The value in the **Unit Price** field for the item will be used on the project planning lines and project journals when this item is entered. This price overrides the regular customer price (the "best price" mechanism) for items. To use the regular customer price, don't specify project item prices for the project.|
|**General Ledger Accounts**|The information in the **Project Task No.**, **Currency Code**, **Line Discount %**, **Unit Cost Factor**, and **Unit Cost** fields will be used on the project planning lines and project journals when this general ledger account is entered and added to a project. When you choose a general ledger account, project planning lines and project journals use the value in the **Unit Price** field for the general ledger project expense.|
|**Project Resources**|The **Project Task No.**, **Work Type**, **Currency Code**, **Line Discount %**, and **Unit Cost Factor** fields. The value in the **Unit Price** field for the resource is used on project planning lines and project journals when you enter a resource, or a resource assigned to the resource group. This price overrides prices specified on the **Resource Price/Resource Group Prices** page.|

#### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant project, and then choose the **Sales Price Lists** action.

## To set up project posting groups

One aspect of planning projects is deciding which posting accounts to use for project costing. To be able to post projects, you set up accounts for posting for each project posting group. A posting group represents a link between the project and how it should be treated in the general ledger. When you create a project, you specify a posting group, and by default, each task you create for the project is associated with that posting group. However, as you create tasks, you can override the default and select a posting group that is more appropriate.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must set up accounts in the chart of accounts before you set up posting groups. For more information, see [Set Up or Change the Chart of Accounts](finance-setup-chart-accounts.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

| Account field | Description | Used in WIP Type |
| --- | --- |  --- |
| **Code** |An identifier for the posting group. You can enter up to 10 characters, including spaces. | |
| **WIP Costs Account** |The WIP account for the calculated cost of the project WIP, which is a balance sheet capital asset account. | Applied Cost, Recognized Costs|
| **WIP Accrued Costs Account** |An account for the Cost Value or Cost of Sales method of WIP calculation. This account is for accrued expense liability on your balance sheet. When a WIP adjustment requires you to increase the usage costs that you post to your income statement, you post to this account. | Accrued Costs|

| **Recognized Sales Account** |The income account that contains the recognized income for the project. It is a credit income account ordinarily. | Recognized Sales|

### Allow multiple people to post project transactions at the same time

To allow people to post transactions for projects at the same time, you can enable the **Enable multiple users to post job ledger entries at the same time** feature update on the **Feature Management** page. By default, the feature isn’t enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Similar features are available for resource, inventory, and warehouse entries. To learn more, go to:
>
> * [Allow multiple people to post resource transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-resources.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-resource-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Allow workers to post inventory transactions at the same time](inventory-how-setup-general.md#allow-workers-to-post-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Design details: Creating warehouse entries](design-details-warehouse-entries.md)

If you enable the feature, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns entry numbers for each table from `SequenceNumbers` in the database, which allows people to post transactions at the same time. The result can be that sometimes entries from two or more transactions are interleaved.

There's a similar feature for inventory transactions. An item register might contain any or all of the entry tables, as shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="media/interleaved inventory tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the item register with several entry tables." lightbox="media/interleaved inventory tables.png":::

If you don’t enable the feature, when someone posts a transaction the tables are locked and other users can’t post. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in each table and assigns a number that’s one higher. This numbering ensures that entries that belong to the same register are consecutive, but prevents other people from posting at the same time.

> [!NOTE]
> You might not want to enable the feature if you have a feature or extension that:
>
> * Relies on consecutive entry numbers.
> * Requires that tables are locked throughout the posting process.

# Design Details: Rounding
Rounding residuals can occur when you value the cost of an inventory decrease that is measured in a different quantity than the corresponding inventory increase. Rounding residuals are calculated for all costing methods when you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.  

 When you use the average costing method, the rounding residual is calculated and recorded on a cumulative, entry-by-entry basis.  

 When you use a costing method other than Average, the rounding residual is calculated when the inventory increase has been fully applied, that is when the remaining quantity for the inventory increase is equal to zero. A separate entry is then created for the rounding residual, and the posting date on this rounding entry is the posting date of the last invoiced value entry of the inventory increase.  

## Example  
 The following example illustrates how different rounding residuals are handled for the average costing method and non-Average costing method, respectively. In both cases, the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job has been run.  

 The following table shows the item ledger entries that the example is based on.  

|Posting Date|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|--------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|3|1|  
|02-01-20|-1|2|  
|03-01-20|-1|3|  
|04-01-20|-1|4|  

 For an item using the Average costing method, the rounding residual (1/300) is calculated with the first decrease (entry number 2) and is carried forward to entry number 3. Therefore, entry number 3 is valued at –3.34.  

 The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|3|10|1|1|  
|02-01-20|-1|-3.33|2|2|  
|03-01-20|-1|-3.34|3|3|  
|04-01-20|-1|-3.33|4|4|  

 For an item using a costing method other than Average, the rounding residual (0.01) is calculated when the remaining quantity for the inventory increase is zero. The rounding residual has a separate entry (number 5).  

 The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|3|10|1|1|  
|02-01-20|-1|-3.33|2|2|  
|03-01-20|-1|-3.33|3|3|  
|04-01-20|-1|-3.33|4|4|  
|01-01-20|0|-0.01|1|5|

# Get ready for doing business

Congratulations, you have your first company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

To help you get ready for doing business, you can visit the **Assisted Setup** page where you can launch assisted setup guides, videos, or help articles for selected setup tasks. To access the page, choose [this link](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1801).  

Alternatively, choose the ![Sprocket icon to open the Settings menu.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png) icon, and then the **Assisted Setup** action.

You can also find the list of assisted setup guides if you choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link.  

> [!TIP]
> [!INCLUDE [ua-get-help](includes/ua-get-help.md)]

## Get started

When you sign in for the first time or launch a new company, the **Get Started** checklist takes you through the steps to make you ready for business. The steps vary depending on your country/region and any industry-specific functionality that you added to your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Starting with 2021 release wave 2, when you first sign in to the CRONUS demonstration company, your home page is optimized for your first experiences. If you prefer to see more links to more pages, just switch to the Business Manager role. For more information, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).  

After you migrate data, such as vendors, customers, and items from your existing financial system, you're ready to begin. But depending on your needs, consider if other assisted setup guides on the list can help you.

If an area isn't covered by an assisted setup, choose the ![Sprocket icon to open the Settings menu.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png) icon, and then the **Advanced Settings** action. In **Advanced Settings**, the **Manual Setup** section provides access to setup pages where you can fill in setup fields for all areas manually. For more information, see also [Setting Up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](setup.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> The list of assisted setup guides, extensions, and services that are available differ depending on the user experience you choose for your company. The **Essential** experience gives access to fewer than the **Premium** experience does.
>
> The first time you sign in, you use the **Essential** experience. For more information, see [Change Which Features are Displayed](ui-experiences.md).

After you run an assisted setup guide, it's marked as **Completed**.  

## Teaching tips and tours

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes in-product tours and teaching tips that can help you get started. In the current version, there are tours for the steps in the **Get started** list and some of the most commonly used pages in the demonstration company, such as the **Sales Invoice** card page.  

Teaching tips are short messages that inform, remind, or teach you about important and new capabilities that launch automatically when you open a page. For example, to see the teaching tip for the **Sales Invoice** card, choose the link in the top left corner of the page where it says *Sales Invoice*. This launches a callout with a short description of the page and what you can do there. If a tour exists for the page, a link invites you to take the tour. The *Learn more* link takes you to the product Help for the page.

## Role-specific home pages

Depending on your role, the home page provides an overview of the business. The navigation bar gives you easy access to customers, vendors, items, and so on. The **Activities** tiles show current data and provide easy access to the selected document.

The **Key Performance Indicators** can be set up to display a selected chart for a visual representation of, for example, cash flow or income and expenses. You can also build up a list of **Favorite Customers** on the home page for accounts that you do business with often or need to pay special attention to.

Use the arrows to collapse a part of the page and make more room to show specific data. At the top of the home page you'll find all of the actions that you can use in the current content. You can collapse this area too. To expand it again, select or tap in the collapsed area.

> [!TIP]  
> You can get back to the home page by selecting the company name in the upper left corner.

## Company information

Under **Company Settings**, you can view and edit setup information about the current company. Much of this information was prefilled if you completed the **Set Up Company** assisted setup when you signed up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you want to change the company logo, contact information, bank settings, or tax information, you can do it from this page.  

## Adding users and permissions

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-short](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-short.md)]

You add users in Microsoft 365 admin center. For more information, see [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).

When users are created in Microsoft 365, you can import them to the **Users** page by using the **Get Updates from Office 365** action. You can then assign permissions to users and to organize them in user groups. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

# Responsible AI FAQ for Chat with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Chat with Copilot in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you're interested in general questions about using the feature, see [FAQ for chat with Copilot](chat-with-copilot-faq.md).

## What is Chat with Copilot?

Microsoft Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that helps you be more creative, productive, and efficient. You can chat with Copilot in Business Central to get answers and insights about [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and your business data by typing what you want to know in natural language.

Chat with Copilot, also called chat, is an interactive feature that answers your questions without requiring you to navigate the user interface or the product documentation. The Copilot pane is available from anywhere in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client.

You can ask questions in natural language, like "How do I deliver goods to my customers directly from my vendors?" or "Do we have any office chairs in stock for under $600?" In response, Copilot provides answers in natural language. Depending on the questions, answers can include plain text, links to records or pages in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and links to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] help articles on Microsoft Learn.

## What are the capabilities of Chat with Copilot?

You can chat with Copilot to get answers to the following classes of questions:

### Explain and guide

You can ask Copilot to explain a specific concept related to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], like what are dimensions, or provide guidance on how to complete a task, like how to post a sales order. Copilot searches the official [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] documentation published by Microsoft, and provides an answer based on the documentation.

- Copilot uses the knowledge on Microsoft Learn (not a broad web search) to semantically search only Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] documentation on Microsoft Learn. This includes product documentation, release plans, local functionality content, and troubleshooting content.

- Copilot doesn't take action, create new data, or modify any configuration. It simply summarizes any paragraphs it finds on Microsoft Learn that match the question or prompt in chat.

### Find business data and related pages

You can ask Copilot to locate pages by name or request records based on specific fields and constraints. If Copilot finds a match, it responds with a link to the relevant record or page, which you can then select to open. Chat with Copilot works closely with analysis assist to generate data analysis tabs directly from the Chat pane, helping you gain insights into your data. This approach is used whenever you ask questions best illustrated by grouped records or simple calculations, such as totals or averages.

- Copilot converts the natural language input into a query consisting of a table search, sort, and filter criteria.

  The capability uses [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s native data search capabilities to find matching data from tables within the companies database. The search runs under your own identity for security and compliance. It doesn't search outside of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database.

- Copilot doesn't take action, create new data, or modify any configuration. It only summarizes the records received from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] native data search.

## What is the intended use of Chat with Copilot?

Chat is designed for enterprise use and answering questions that relate to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and the business data it contains. The feature helps you solve common tasks such as finding records or getting guidance. You can express yourself in your own words, making your work easier and more accessible when working with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## How was Chat with Copilot evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

- The feature underwent extensive testing during which numerous English language texts covering a broad range of topics and styles of expressing intent were given to Copilot. The outcomes were evaluated against accuracy, relevance, and safety.
  
- The feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. [Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft](https://aka.ms/RAI).

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content?

Microsoft has various systems in place to ensure that content generated by Copilot is of the highest quality, detect abuse, and ensure safety for our customers and their data.

You can provide feedback to every Copilot response and report inaccurate or inappropriate content to help Microsoft improve this feature. 

- You can provide feedback by using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icon on the **Copilot** pane in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
  
- We analyze and utilize your feedback on the feature to help us improve responses.
  
- If you encounter inappropriate generated content, report it to Microsoft by using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249810).
  
- Microsoft might disable the Copilot features for selected customers if abuse of the functionality is detected.

## What are the limitations of Chat with Copilot? How can users minimize the impact of the Chat with Copilot limitations when using the system?

- General limitations of AI

  AI systems are valuable tools but they're nondeterministic. The content they generate might not be accurate. So, it's important to use your judgment to review and verify responses Copilot before making decisions that could affect stakeholders like customers and partners. For most responses, Copilot also includes citations or reference links that you can use to quickly verify whether Copilot gives a correct answer. For example, when asked how to perform some task, Copilot includes links to the source article. When asked to find a record based on specific criteria, Copilot includes links that describe the list page it identified as the topic of conversation. It also provides information about any filters or sorting that was applied to reach an answer.

- Language limitations

  - [!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

    If you chat with Copilot in a language other than English, Copilot might either respond in the same language, in English, or not at all. While in preview, chat is intended for use with the English language only.

  - The quality of answers can be lower under the following conditions:
    - The language of chat messages to Copilot is something other than en-US.
    - The language setting for the user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] differs from the primary language of the data in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database.

- Specific industry, product, and topic limitations

   Chat includes built-in safety mechanisms that prevent the undesirable generation of harmful content, such as sexually explicit content or incitement of violence. Sometimes, customers operate in industries, sell products and services, or work with processes that naturally overlap with what might be considered inappropriate in other contexts, or work with data that might trigger these safeguards. Chat might not perform as well in these cases.

## What data does Chat with Copilot collect and how is it used

Microsoft doesn't use your company data, including the text you send to Copilot, to train the foundational AI models for the benefit of others. Company administrators have full control to govern this data that is part of their Azure subscription. Because administrators or others in your company might have access to this data as determined by your employer, we recommend you don't enter sensitive data such as passwords or other secrets.

## What does Chat with Copilot offer for security

Chat is designed to be secure and executes under the user's identity, inheriting all security permissions and other restrictions and never operating outside of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s platform security. This design means that Copilot can only access data that you have access to.

For users with SUPER permission, chat can more easily locate unsecured data that's typically harder to get to for other users. Organizations that don't apply [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s security model to restrict which tables and objects each user or user role has access to, might be at elevated risk when using chat. Therefore, we recommend that your organization either implements [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s security model or deactivates chat.

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

In this article, you learn how to install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] App for [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/). The app is available on the Teams marketplace, and you can use it with the Teams web, desktop, or mobile app.

> [!NOTE]
> Your administrator may have set things up so that the app is automatically installed for you. To check whether the app is installed, open Teams, then choose **Apps**. Search for **Business Central**, then choose it when you find it. If you see **Open** on the **Business Central** page, the app is already installed.  

## Prerequisites

- A [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online user account is required for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams.

    If you’re not sure whether you have an account, or if you don’t know your credentials for signing in, contact your company administrator to help you get started.

- Access to the Teams desktop app or Teams in the browser. You can't install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by using Teams mobile app.

- Your organization's policies allow you to install apps in Microsoft Teams.

## Add the Business Central app to Teams

# Building [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports for displaying [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] data

You can make your [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] data available as a data source in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)] and build powerful reports about the state of your business.

This article describes how to start using [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)] to create reports that display [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] data. After you create reports, you can publish them to your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] or share them with all users in your organization. When the reports are in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)], users with access can view the reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)].

## Get ready

- Sign up for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)].

  If you aren't signed up, go to [https://powerbi.microsoft.com](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). When you sign up, use your work email address and password.

- Download [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).

  [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)] is a free application you install on your local computer. Learn more at [Quickstart: Connect to data in Power BI Desktop](/power-bi/desktop-quickstart-connect-to-data).

- Make sure the data you want in the report is available as an API (recommended) or published as a web service. Learn more in [Expose data through API pages or OData web services](admin-powerbi-setup.md#exposedata).

<!--- For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, get the following information:

  - The OData URL for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
  
    Typically, this URL has the format `http[s]://[computer]:[port]/[serverinstance]/ODataV4`, for example, `https://localhost:7048/BC190/ODataV4`. If you have a multi-tenant deployment, include the tenant in the URL, for example, `https://localhost:7048/BC190/ODataV4?tenant=tenant1`.
  - A username and web service access key of a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] account.

    To get data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], Power BI uses basic authentication. So, you'll need a username and web service access key to connect. The account might be your own user account, or your organization may have a specific account for this purpose.-->

- Download the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report theme (optional).

  Learn more in [Use the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report theme](#theme) in this article.

[!INCLUDE[note-multicompany-reports](includes/note-multicompany-reports.md)]

## <a name="getdata"></a>Add [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source in Power BI Desktop

The first task in creating reports is to add [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)]. Once connected, you can start to build the report.

1. Start [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)].
1. Select **Get Data**.

    If you don't see **Get Data**, select the **File** menu, then **Get Data**.
1. On the **Get Data** page, select **Online Services**.
1. In the **Online Services** pane, do one of the following steps:

    - To connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, select **Dynamics 365 Business Central**, then **Connect**.
    <!--- To connect to  [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, select **Dynamics 365 Business Central (on-premises)**, then **Connect**.-->

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (one-time only).

    If you aren't signed in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)], you're prompted to sign in.

    - For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, select **Sign in**, and then choose the relevant account. Use the same account that you use to sign into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When done, select **Connect**.

    <!--- For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, first enter the OData URL for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], then select **OK**. When prompted, enter the username and password of the account to use for connecting to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In the **Password** box, enter the web service access key. When done, select **Connect**.-->

    > [!NOTE]  
    > After you connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you won't be prompted again to sign in. [How do I change or clear the account I'm currently using to connect to Business Central from Power BI Desktop?](/dynamics365/business-central/power-bi-faq?tabs=designer#perms)

6. When connected, [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] contacts the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] service. The **Navigator** window displays the data sources that are available for building reports. Select a folder to expand it and show the available data sources.

   These data sources represent all APIs and web services that are published for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], grouped by environments and companies. With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, **Navigator** has the following structure:

    - **Environment name**
      - **Company name**
        - **Advanced APIs**

          This folder lists advanced APIs published by Microsoft, like the [Business Central automation APIs](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/itpro-introduction-to-automation-apis) and APIs published by other organizations (these APIs are called Custom APIs). Custom APIs are further grouped in folders according to the [APIPublisher](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-apipublisher-property)/[APIGroup](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-apigroup-property) properties of the API source code.

        - **Standard APIs v2.0**

          This folder lists the data APIs exposed in the [Business Central API V2.0](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/). You use these APIs to read data from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database, such as master data (customer, vendor, item, and so on), transactions (general ledger entries, customer entries, and so on), or setup data (dimensions, payment methods, unit of measure, and so on).

        - **Web services \(legacy)**

          This folder lists pages, codeunits, and queries that are published as web services in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Using this legacy method to read data from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is discouraged. We suggest using APIs instead.

    <!--
    > [!NOTE]
    > The structure for Business Central on-premises is different because it doesn't support API pages.-->

7. Select the data source or sources that you want to add to your data model, and then select the **Load** button.
8. If later you want to add more Business Central data, you can repeat the previous steps.

Once the data is loaded, you can see it in the right navigation on the page. At this point, you're connected to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data, and you can begin building your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] report.  

> [!TIP]
> For more information about using [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)], go to [Get started with Power BI Desktop](/power-bi/fundamentals/desktop-getting-started).

## Creating accessible reports

It's important to make your reports usable for as many people as possible. Try to design reports so that they don't require any special adaptation to meet the specific needs of different users. Make sure the design lets users take advantage of assistive technologies, like screen readers. [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] includes various accessibility features, tools, and guidelines to help. To learn more, go to [Design Power BI reports for accessibility](/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-accessibility-creating-reports) in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] documentation.

## Creating reports to display data associated with a list in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

You can create reports that display in a FactBox on a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] list page, and change when different rows are selected in the list. Creating these reports is similar to other reports, except there are a few things to do to make sure the reports display as expected. To learn more, go to [Creating Power BI Reports for Displaying List Data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](across-how-use-powerbi-reports-factbox.md).

## <a name="theme"></a>Using the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report theme (optional)

Before building your report, we recommend that you download and import the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] theme file. The theme file creates a color palette so you can build reports with the same color styling as the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] apps, without requiring you to define custom colors for each visual.

> [!NOTE]
> This task is optional. You can always create your reports and then download and apply the style template later.

### Download the theme

The theme file is available as a json file on Microsoft Power BI Community Themes Gallery. To download the theme file, do the following steps:

1. Go to [Microsoft Power BI Community Themes Gallery for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Themes-Gallery/Microsoft-Dynamics-365-Business-Central/m-p/385875).
2. Select the download attachment **Microsoft Dynamics Business Central.json**.

### Import the theme on a report

After you download the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report theme, you can import it to your reports. To import the theme, Select the **View** > **Themes** > **Browse for themes**. Learn more in [Power BI Desktop - Import custom report themes](/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-report-themes#import-custom-report-theme-files).

## Publish reports

After you create or modify a report, you can publish the report to your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] and also share it with others in your organization. After you publish a report, it's available in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The report also becomes available for selection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

To publish a report, select **Publish** on the **Home** tab of the ribbon or from the **File** menu. If you're signed into the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)], the report is published to this service. Otherwise, you're prompted to sign in. 

## Distribute or share a report

There are a couple of ways to share reports:

- Share a report from your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] (recommended)

    If you have a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-pro-license-name](includes/powerbi-pro-license-name.md)] license or use [!INCLUDE [powerbi-premium-capacity-name](includes/powerbi-premium-capacity-name.md)], you can share the report directly from your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. To learn more, go to [Power BI - Share a dashboard or report](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards#share-a-dashboard-or-report).

- Distribute reports as .pbix files.

    Reports are stored on your computer as .pbix files. You can distribute the .pbix file to users, like any other file. Then, the people you shared the file with can upload it to their [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. To learn more, go to [Upload reports from files](across-working-with-powerbi.md#upload).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Distributing reports in this way means that refreshing data for reports is done individually by each user. This situation might impact [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] performance.

## How to develop cross-company or cross-environment [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports

The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] API endpoints all have the prefix `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/<environment_name>/api/v2.0` followed by `/companies({company_id})/accounts({id})` (here we use the `accounts` API as an illustration). You can use this structure to create PowerQuery queries that load data for multiple companies or multiple environments if the user who is reading data can access them.

To set up a query to load data for multiple companies, follow these steps:

1. Take the PowerQuery query that loads data for a single company. Convert it to a custom Power Query function that takes the company ID (or maybe the environment name) as parameters. To learn more, go to [Using custom Power Query functions](/power-query/custom-function).
1. Now use the new custom function in a PowerQuery query, where you map the function over a list of companies and then merge the datasets using the [Table.Combine](/powerquery-m/table-combine) Power Query function.

## <a name="advancedopts"></a>Advanced: Customize language, timeout, database replica, or page size for your Business Central data source

The [!INCLUDE [powerbi-connector-name](includes/powerbi-connector-name.md)] supports several advanced properties for connecting to a Business Central data source that you can set in your Power Query queries. The following table describes the parameters.

|Parameter|Description|Default|Learn more at|
|-|-|-|-|
|AcceptLanguage|This parameter allows you to specify preferred languages for responses, ensuring users receive messages and translatable strings in their desired language. It sets the language in which the Business Central API session runs. It influences the language of error messages, formatted values in AL, and other values that depend on language or culture.<br><br>Setting this parameter improves user satisfaction and makes the data more accessible and relevant.|*not specified*|[Use locale values in multiple-language Power BI reports](/power-bi/guidance/multiple-language-locale#load-a-report-in-power-bi).|
|ODataMaxPageSize|This parameter limits the number of entities per results page, which allows for more flexibility when connecting to large datasets or using complex queries. It sets the maximum number of records to return for each page when calling an API. For example, if your table **Customers** has 13,000 records and ODataMaxPageSize is set to 5000, Power BI makes 3 API calls to get your customers. The first call gets 5,000 records, the next one gets 5000 more, and the last call gets the remaining 3000. This option can't be higher than the maximum page size enforced by Business Central, which is 20000.<br><br>Setting this parameter ensures efficient and responsive data retrieval, leading to faster insights and decision-making. You can't exceed the maximum page size defined on the service.|5000|[ODataPreferenceHeader.MaxPageSize Property](/dotnet/api/microsoft.odata.odatapreferenceheader.maxpagesize)|
|Timeout|This parameter defines the maximum duration for a request before cancellation. It sets the timeout for each single API call to Business Central. Its value can't exceed the timeout enforced on the Business Central service, which is currentæy 10 minutes (00:10:00).<br><br>Setting this parameter helps manage system resources effectively and prevents long-running queries from impacting overall system performance. Users experience minimal delays and interruptions, ensuring a smoother workflow. |00:08:00|[OData.Feed](/powerquery-m/odata-feed)|
|UseReadOnlyReplica|This parameter determines whether requests target the primary database or a read-only replica. Offloading read operations from the primary database can significantly boost performance.<br><br> Setting this property leads to faster data retrieval and improved system stability, especially during peak usage times.|true||

### Configure the advanced parameters

1. Start [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)].
2. Complete the step that suits your scenario:

   # [Edit existing report](#tab/existing)

   1. Select **File** > **Open**.
   1. Browse for and select the report (.pbix). 
   1. In the ribbon, select **Transform Data** to open the **Power Query Editor**.

   # [Create new report](#tab/new)

   1. In the ribbon, select **Get Data**. If you don't see **Get Data**, select the **File** menu, then **Get Data**.
   1. On the **Get Data** page, select **Online Services** > **Dynamics 365 Business Central** > **Connect**.
   1. In the **Navigator** window, select the API endpoint that you want to load data from.
   1. Select **Transform Data** instead of **Load** as you might normally do. This step opens **Power Query Editor**.

   ---

3. In **Power Query Editor**, select **Advanced Editor** from the ribbon.
4. In **Advanced Editor**, locate the line that starts with `Source =`:

   ```powerquery
   Source = Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions(null, null, null, null),
   ```

5. In the line, replace the fourth parameter of `Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions` with a comma separated list of properties and values you want to set, for example:

   ```powerquery
   Source = Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions(null, null, null, Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions(null, null, null, [UseReadOnlyReplica = true, Timeout = Duration.From("00:07:00"), ODataMaxPageSize = 10000, AcceptLanguage = "it-it"])
   ```

6. Select **Done** to close **Advanced Editor**.
7. Select **Close & Apply** to save the changes and close Power Query Editor.

## Fixing problems

### "Expression.Error: The environment 'Production' does not exist." error when specifying a Business Central environment

> **APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online

When you connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online from [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)], or when you install a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)] app from Microsoft AppSource that uses [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data, you might be prompted to input the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment you want to connect to.

If you get an error similar to "Expression.Error: The environment 'Production' does not exist.", follow these steps to troubleshoot:

1. Make sure you're using the right credentials to access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. These credentials might not be the same credentials you use to access [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)]. [How do I change or clear the account I'm currently using to connect to Business Central from Power BI Desktop?](/dynamics365/business-central/power-bi-faq?tabs=designer#perms)
2. If your environment is an embedded ISV environment, you need to specify the embedded ISV name in parenthesis as part of the environment name. For example, if you want to connect to an environment named Production from the embedded ISV named Fabrikam, you must specify "PRODUCTION (fabrikam)" as environment name.

### "Can't insert a record. Current connection intent is Read-Only." error connecting to custom API page

> **APPLIES TO:** Business Central online

By default, reports that use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data connect to a read-only replica of the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database. In rare cases, depending on the API design, you might get an error when you try to connect to and get data from the API. The error looks like this:

`Dynamics365BusinessCentral: Request failed: The remote server returned an error: (400) Bad Request. (Can't insert a record. Current connection intent is Read-Only. CorrelationId: [...])".`

If you're using a custom API, we recommend you rework the AL code to make sure it doesn't make database modifications when it's just reading data. But in case your scenario requires it, you can [configure the connector to use a read-write connection instead](#advancedopts).

# Analyze list page and query data using data analysis feature

> **APPLIES TO:** Public preview in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2023 release wave 1 for analyzing list pages. Generally available in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2023 release wave 2 for analyzing data from list pages and queries.

This article explains how to use the data analysis feature from list pages and queries. The data analysis lets you analyze data directly from the page, without having to run a report or open another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using different options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are: "My customers," "Follow up items," "Recently added vendors," "Sales statistics," or any other view you can imagine.

> [!TIP]
> A good thing about the data analysis feature is that it doesn't change the underlying data of a list page or query. It also doesn't change the layout of the page or query when it isn't in analysis mode. So the best way to learn about what you can do in analysis mode is to try things out.

## Prerequisites

- If you're using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version 22, the data analysis feature is in preview. So, an admin must enable it before you can use it. To enable it, go to the **Feature Management** page and switch on **Feature Update: Analysis mode, quickly analyze data directly in Business Central**. [Learn more about Feature Management](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).
- In version 23 and later, your account must be assigned the **DATA ANALYSIS - EXEC** permission set or include execute permission on the system object **9640 Allow Data Analysis mode**. As an admin, you can exclude these permissions for users who you don't want to access the analysis mode.

> [!NOTE]
> Some list pages don't offer the **Enter analysis mode** toggle for turning on analysis mode. The reason is that developers can disable analysis mode on specific pages by using the [AnalysisModeEnabled property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-analysismodeenabled-property) in AL.

## Get started

Follow these steps to start using the analysis mode.

>[!TIP]
> Analysis mode also includes a Copilot feature called *analysis assist* that can help you get started. [Learn more about analysis assist with Copilot.](analysis-assist.md)

1. Open the list page or query.

   For example, to work with the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, select the ![Magnifying glass that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png) icon (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>), enter *customer ledger entries*, and then choose the related link. 

1. In the action bar at the top of the page, select the **Enter analysis mode** ![Shows the button for turning on analysis mode](media/analysis-mode-icon.png) button.

    The analysis mode opens the data in an experience that's optimized for data analysis. While in analysis mode, the normal action bar is replaced with a special analysis mode bar. The following figure illustrates the different areas of a page in the analysis mode.

   [![Shows an overview of a page in the analysis mode](media/analysis-mode-overview-3.png)](media/analysis-mode-overview-3.png#lightbox)

   Each area is explained in the sections that follow.

1. Use the different areas to manipulate, summarize, and analyze data. See the sections that follow for details.

1. When you want to stop the analysis mode, select the **Leave analysis mode** ![Shows the button for turning off analysis mode](media/analysis-mode-exit-icon.png) button.

   The analysis tabs that you added remain until you delete them. If you return to the analysis mode again, you see them exactly as you left them.

> [!NOTE]
> The data shown in analysis mode is controlled by the filters or views set on the list page. This allows you to pre-filter data before entering analysis mode.

## Work with analysis mode

In the analysis mode, the page is divided into two areas:

- The main area, which consists of the data area (1), summary bar (2), and tabs bar (5).
- The data manipulation area, which consists of two panes: columns (3) and analysis filters (4).

### Data area (1)

The data area is where the rows and columns of the list page query are shown and data is summarized. The data area provides a versatile way to control the layout of columns and a quick way to get a summary of the data. For columns that contain numeric values, the sum of all values in the column is shown in the last row, unless you define row groups. In this case, the sums appear as a subtotal for the groups.  

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-data-area.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of a data area on a page in the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-data-area.png":::

- To move a column, select it and drag it to where it makes the most sense in your analysis.
- To sort on a column, select the column header. To sort on multiple columns, select and hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while selecting the column headers you want to sort on.
- To access several actions that you can do on columns, right-click the column or hover over it and select the menu icon ![Shows the icon on a column in analysis mode that opens a menu of actions](media/analysis-mode-column-menu-icon.png). For example:

  - To pin a column to the data area so that it doesn't move off the screen when you scroll, select ![Shows the icon on a column in analysis mode that opens a menu of actions](media/analysis-mode-column-menu-icon.png) > **Pin column** > **Pin left** the column part.
  - Define data filters directly on the column definition instead of going to the **Analysis Filters** panes. You can still peek in on details about related data and for each line, and open the card to learn more about a given entity.   
- Use the data area to interact with the data. For columns that contain numeric, summable values, you can get descriptive statistics on a set of fields by marking them. The statistics appear in the status bar (2) along the bottom of the page.

Note that in the data area, you can filter on all columns, including totals such as sum or count. 

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-filter-on-totals.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to filter on totals in analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-filter-on-totals.png":::

### Summary bar (2)

The summary bar is along the bottom of the page and displays statistics about the data in the list page or query. As you interact with columns whose values can be summed, like selecting multiple rows in a column that displays amounts, the data updates.

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-totals-row.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of a summary bar on the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-totals-row.png":::

The following table describes the different numbers that are shown in the totals area:

|Number|Description|
|-|-|
|Rows|The number of selected rows as a part of the total number of available rows. |
|Total rows|The number of rows in the unfiltered list or query.|
|Filtered|The number of rows displayed as a result of the filters applied to the list or query.|
|Average|The average value in all the selected summable fields.|
|Count|The number of selected rows.|
|Min|The minimum value in all the selected summable fields.|
|Max|The maximum value in all the selected summable fields.|
|Sum|The sum total of all the values in the selected summable fields.|

### Columns (3)

The **Columns** pane is one of two panes that work together to define your analysis. The other area is the **Analysis filters** pane. The **Columns** pane is used to summarize the data. Use the **Columns** pane to define which columns should be included in the analysis.

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-columns-3.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of the columns pane in the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-columns-3.png":::

|Areas|Description|
|-|-|
|Search/check or clear all boxes|Search for columns. To select/clear all columns, select the checkbox.|
|Check boxes|This area includes a checkbox for each field in the list's or query's source table. Use this area to change what columns are shown. Select a checkbox to show a column for the field on the page; clear the checkbox to hide the column. |
|Row groups|Use this area to group and sum data by one or more fields. You can only include non-numeric fields, like text, date, and time fields. Row groups are used often in pivot mode.|
|Values|Use this area to specify fields that you want a sum total for. You can only include fields that contain numbers that can be added together; for example, not text, date, or time fields.|

To move a field from one area to another, select the grab icon ![Shows the button for grabbing a field in the analysis mode](media/column-grab-icon.png) next to the column in the list and drag it into the target area. You're prevented from moving a field to an area where it isn't allowed.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use personalization to add or remove fields from a list page, your choice of visibility is reflected in the **Columns** pane. An added field has the **Show** checkbox cleared. To include the added field in an analysis definition, select the checkbox in the **Columns** pane. To learn more about personalization, go to [Add/remove fields and columns on a page](ui-personalization-user.md#fields).

### Analysis filters (4)

The **Analysis filters** pane lets you set further data filters on columns to limit the entries in the list. Set filters on columns to limit the entries in the list and subsequent sums to only those entries you're interested in based on a criteria you define. For example, suppose you're only interested in data for a specific customer or sales orders that exceed a specific amount. To set a filter, select the column, choose the comparison operation from the list (like **Equals** or **Starts with**), and then enter the value.

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-filters-2.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of the filters pane in the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-filters-2.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> The additional filters only apply to the current analysis tab. This allows you to define exactly the extra data filters that are needed for a specific analysis.

### Tabs (5)

The tabs area at the top lets you create different configurations (columns and analysis filters) on separate tabs, where you can manipulate data on the tabs independently of each other. There's always at least one tab, called **Analysis 1** by default. Adding more tabs is beneficial for saving frequently used analysis configurations on a dataset. For example, you might have tabs for analyzing data in the pivot mode, and other tabs that filter to a subset of rows. Some tabs might show a detailed view with many columns, and others only display a few key columns.

Here are some pointers on working with multiple analysis tabs:

- To add a new tab, select the large **+** sign next to the last analysis tab.
- Select the down arrow on a tab to access a list of actions you can do on a tab, like rename, duplicate, delete, and move.

   - **Delete** deletes the tab you currently have open. **Delete All** deletes all tabs that you added, except the default **Analysis 1** tab.
- You can't completely remove the **Analysis 1**, but you can rename it by using the **Rename** action and clear the changes you made by using **Delete** or **Delete All**.  

- The analysis tabs that you add and configure remain until you delete them. If you return to the analysis mode, they're exactly as you left them.

   > [!TIP]
   > The tabs that you set up are only visible to you. Other users will only see tabs they've set up.
- You can copy analysis tabs. Copying can be useful, for example, for experimenting with changing a tab without changing the original. Copying is also useful if you want to create different variations of the same analysis.

## Date hierarchies

In analysis mode, date fields of the dataset are generated in a Year-Quarter-Month hierarchy of three separate fields. This hierarchy is based on the normal calendar, not any fiscal calendars defined in Business Central.

The extra fields are named *\<field name\> Year*, *\<field name\> Quarter*, and *\<field name\> Month*. For example, if the dataset includes a field called *Posting Date*, then the corresponding date hierarchy consists of fields called *Posting Date Year*, *Posting Date Quarter*, and *Posting Date Month*.

> [!NOTE]
> The date hierarchy currently only applies to fields of type date, not for fields of type datetime.

## Pivot mode

You can use pivot mode to analyze large amounts of numerical data, subtotaling data by categories and subcategories. The pivot mode is like [pivot tables in Microsoft Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-pivottable-to-analyze-worksheet-data-a9a84538-bfe9-40a9-a8e9-f99134456576).

To turn pivot mode on and off, turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle on the **Columns** pane (3). When you turn on pivot mode, the **Column labels** area appears in the pane. Use the **Column labels** area to group sum totals for rows into categories. Fields that you add to the **Column labels** area show as columns in the data area (1).

Building out the data analysis in pivot mode involves moving fields into the three areas: **Row groups**, **Columns labels**, and **Values**. The following figure illustrates where the fields map to the data area (1), where `sum` is the calculated data, and optionally **Values**.

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Column label</th><th></th><th>Column label</th><th></th></tr>
<tr><th>Row group</th><th>Value</th><th>Value</th><th>Value</th><th>Value</th></tr>
<tr><td>row</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td></tr>
<tr><td>row</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td></tr>
<tr><td>row</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td></tr>
<tr><td>row</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td></tr>
</table>

> [!TIP]
> Columns that only have a few possible values are the best candidates for using in column **Values**.

## Want to Export data to Excel?

Right-click on the data area or a selection of cells to export data.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-export-to-excel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to export data from an analysis to Excel":::


## Analyze large amounts of data

If the dataset you want to analyze exceeds 100,000 rows, we suggest you enter an analysis mode that's optimized for large datasets. There are currently two limitations if you switch to this mode: 

- Formatting of fields of the following four data types might change: 

   - currency 
   - decimals (always shown with two decimals) 
   - dates (always shown in the format YYYY-MM-DD)
   - timezones
- Fields that are used in pivot mode and added to column labels must have a low number of distinct values.

   If you enable pivot mode and drag a field into the **Column labels** area, where the underlying data for that field has too many distinct values, your browser tab might become unresponsive. The browser eventually closes, requiring you to start over in a new session. In this case, either don't pivot on that field or set a filter on the field before you add it to the **Column labels** area.

## Share data analysis

After you prepare an analysis on a tab, you can share it as a link with coworkers and others in your organization directly from the client. Only recipients who have permission to the company and the data can use the link.

1. On the analysis tab, select the down arrow, and then select **Copy link**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-copy.png" alt-text="Shows the action for copying an analysis" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-copy.png":::

   The **Link to \<tab name\>** dialog opens.

1. By default, the analysis you share links to the page or query in the company you're currently working in, which is indicated by `company=<company_name>` in the URL field next to the **Copy** button. If you want to send a link to an analysis that isn't associated with a specific company, set the **Company:** field to **Do not link to a specific company**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-link-copied.svg" alt-text="Shows the copy link dialog for an analysis tab" lightbox="media/analysis-link-copied.svg":::

1. Select **Copy**.
1. Paste the link into the communication media of your choice, like Word, Outlook, Teams, or OneNote.
1. Recipients can select the link and open the analysis for the page or query in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. They're prompted to specify a name for the new analysis tab that they create.  

## Examples of how to analyze data

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of scenarios for many of the functional areas in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Example: Finance (Accounts Receivables)

To see what your customers owe you, maybe broken down into time intervals for when amounts are due, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25) list, and choose :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: to turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the *Search* field on the right).
1. Turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle (located above the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Customer Name** field to the **Row Groups** area, and drag **Remaining Amount** to the **Values** area.
1. Drag the **Due Date Month** field to the **Column Labels** area.
1. Use the **Analysis Filters** menu (located below the **Columns** menu on the right) to apply a filter and analyze data for a given year or quarter.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Aged Accounts by Month**, or something that describes this analysis.

### Ad hoc data analysis examples by functional area

Many of the functional areas in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have articles with ad hoc data analysis examples.

[!INCLUDE[ad-hoc-analysis-scenarios-table](includes/ad-hoc-analysis-scenarios-table.md)]

## Limitations in 2023 release wave 1 (preview)

The public preview of this feature has the following limitations:

- The analysis mode view has a limit of 100,000 rows. If you exceed this, you get a message telling you so. To work around this limitation, set filters on the page before you switch to analysis mode, if possible. For example, you want to analyze a certain group of customers or only want data from the current year. You can also choose a predefined view if it would work for your analysis.
- The share data analysis feature isn't available.
- The ability to save preferred data analysis choices on list pages and save analysis menus per analysis tab are currently not available.

# Walkthrough: Calculating work in process for a project

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

For projects, you can schedule the use of company resources and track their associated costs. Projects involve the consumption of employee hours, machine hours, inventory items, and other types of usage that you should track as a project progresses. If a project runs over a long period, you might want to transfer its costs to a Work in Process (WIP) account on the balance sheet. You can then recognize the costs and sales in your income statement accounts.  

## About this walkthrough

This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

- Calculate WIP.  
- Select a WIP calculation method.  
- Exclude part of a project from the WIP.  
- Post the WIP to the general ledger.  
- Reverse a WIP posting.  

Each step of the process calculates the value and moves the project transactions to the general ledger. The calculation and posting steps are separated to help you review your data and to make modifications before posting to the general ledger. Therefore, you should make sure that all information is correct after you run the calculation batch jobs and before you run the posting batch jobs.  

## Roles

This walkthrough uses the project team member (Tricia) as the persona.  

## Story

This walkthrough focuses on CRONUS International Ltd., a design and consultancy firm that designs and fits new infrastructures, such as conference halls and offices, with furniture, accessories, and storage units. Most of the work at CRONUS is project-oriented and Tricia, a project team member, uses project to have an overview of ongoing and completed projects. Some projects can be lengthy and take months to complete. Tricia can use a WIP account to record the work in process and track the costs throughout the project.  

## Calculating WIP

CRONUS has taken on a lengthy project that has now extended across reporting periods. Tricia calculates the work in process (WIP) to make sure that the financial statement is accurate.  

During this procedure, Tricia selects a specific group of tasks to include in the WIP calculation. On the **Project Task Lines** page, Tricia specifies the lines in the **WIP-Total** column.  

The following table describes the options.  

|Field|Description|  
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**\<blank\>**|Leave blank if the project task is a part of a group of tasks.|  
|**Total**|Defines the range or group of tasks that are included in the WIP and recognition calculation. Within the group, the WIP total includes any project task with **Project Task Type** set to **Posting**, unless its **WIP-Total** field is set to **Excluded**.|  
|**Excluded**|Applies only to a task with a **Project Task Type** of **Posting**. The task isn't included when WIP and recognition are calculated.|  

In the following walkthrough, Tricia applies the Cost Value method, which is their company standard, to calculate WIP. Tricia specifies the part of the project to include in the WIP calculation by assigning WIP-Total values to various project task lines.  

### To calculate WIP  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Projects** list, select the **Deerfield** project, and then choose the **Edit** action. This opens the Project Card in edit mode.  

     WIP can be calculated based on Cost Value, Sales Value, Cost of Sales, Percentage of Completion, or Completed Contract. In this example, CRONUS uses the Cost Value method.  

3. On the **Posting** FastTab, choose the **WIP Method** field, and then select **Cost Value**.  
4. Choose the **Project Task Lines** action and set the following values in the **WIP-Total** field.  

   |Project Task No.|WIP-Total Field|  
   |------------------|----------------------|  
   |1130|Excluded|  
   |1190|Total|  
   |1210|Excluded|  
   |1310|Excluded|  

5. Choose the **WIP** action, and then choose the **Calculate WIP** action.  
6. On the **Project Calculate WIP** page, select a project to calculate WIP for. On the **Project** FastTab, select **Deerfield** in the **No.** field.  
7. In the **Posting Date** field, enter a date that's later than the work date.
8. In the **Document No.** field, enter **1**. You can use this number later for traceability.  
9. Choose the **OK** button to run the batch job. A message is displayed. Choose the **OK** button to continue. Close the **Project Task Lines** page.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The message states that there are warnings associated with the WIP calculation. You'll review the warnings in the next procedure.  

10. On the **Project Card** page, expand the **WIP and Recognition** FastTab to see the calculated values. You can also see the **WIP Posting Date** and the values posted to the general ledger, if any.  

   Notice that the value for **Recog. Costs Amount** is 215.60 in the **To Post** column. This reflects the total costs of two of the items in the group of project tasks 1110 – 1130. The third item was set to **Excluded**, and therefore isn't included in the WIP calculation.  

### To review WIP warnings  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project WIP Cockpit**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the **Deerfield** project, and then choose the **Show Warnings** action.  
3. On the **Project WIP Warnings** page, review the warning associated with the project.  

   After the accounting period ends, Tricia must recalculate WIP to include the work completed to this point.  

### To recalculate WIP  

1. On the **Project Card** page, choose the **WIP Entries** action to view the WIP calculation.  

     The **Project WIP Entries** page shows the WIP entries that were last calculated on a project, even if WIP hasn't yet been posted to the general ledger.  

2. You can follow the steps in the procedure that explains how to calculate WIP to recalculate WIP. Every time WIP is calculated, an entry is created on the **Project WIP Entries** page.  
3. Close the page.  

> [!NOTE]  
> WIP and recognition are calculated but aren't posted to the general ledger. To post, use the **Post WIP to G/L** action after you calculate the WIP and recognition.

## Posting WIP to general ledger

Now that Tricia has calculated WIP for this project, they can post it to the general ledger.  

### To post WIP to general ledger  

1. From the **Projects** list, select the **Deerfield** project.  
2. Choose the **WIP** action, and then choose the **Post WIP to G/L** action.  
3. On the **Project Post WIP to G/L** page, on the **Projects** FastTab, select **Deerfield** in the **No.** field.  
4. On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Reversal Document No.** field, enter **1**.  
5. Choose the **OK** button to post WIP to the general ledger.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to close the confirmation page.  

   After you complete the posting, you can view the posting information on the **WIP G/L Entries** page.  

7. In the **Projects** list, select the **Deerfield** project, and then choose the **WIP G/L Entries** action.  

   On the **Project WIP G/L Entries** page, verify that the WIP posted to the general ledger.  

8. Close the page.  
9. Open the **Project Card** page for the **Deerfield** project.  
10. On the **WIP and Recognition** FastTab, notice that in the **Posted** column, the **Recog. Costs G/L Amount** field is filled in, which indicates that WIP was posted to the general ledger successfully.  
11. Choose the **OK** button to close the card.  

## Reversing a WIP posting

Tricia determines that the project tasks that were excluded from the calculation of WIP should have been included. Tricia can reverse the incorrect postings without having to post new WIP postings.  

### To reverse a WIP posting  

1. From the **Projects** list, select the **Deerfield** project.  
2. Choose the **WIP** action, and then choose the **Post WIP to G/L** action.  
3. On the **Project Post to WIP to G/L** page, on the **Project** FastTab, select **Deerfield** in the **No.** field.  
4. On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Reversal Document No.** field, enter **1**.  
5. In the **Reversal Posting Date** field, enter the original posting date. It should be the same date that you used to calculate WIP the first time.  
6. Select the **Reverse Only** checkbox. This reverses the previously posted WIP, and posts new WIP to the general ledger.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to run the batch job, and choose the **OK** button to close the confirmation page.  
8. Open the **Project Card** page for the **Deerfield** project.  
9. On the **WIP and Recognition** FastTab, verify that there aren't any posted WIP entries.  
10. Close this page.  
11. In the **Projects** list, select the **Deerfield** project, choose the **WIP** action, and then choose the **WIP G/L Entries** action. The WIP entries have the **Reversed** checkbox selected.  
12. Close this page.  
13. Open **Project Task Lines** for the project, include the parts of the project that should be in the WIP calculation, and then recalculate and post the new value to the general ledger.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Suppose Tricia calculated and posted WIP for a project with incorrect dates. Following the method that was discussed earlier, Tricia can reverse the incorrect postings, correct the dates, and post to the general ledger.

The Essential Business Insights extension finds interesting business facts in your company data and displays them as newspaper-like headlines in Role Centers. Depending on what the extension finds in the data, the insights are from the last week, month, or three months from the current date. The insights update every 10 minutes.  

If you want to take a closer look at an insight, you can choose it to go to its source. For example, if you want details about the largest sales invoice that was posted last week, you can choose the insight to display the invoice.

The following table describes the insights that this extension provides for each Role Center.

|Role Center|Questions the Insights Answer|
|----|-----|
|Default|Displays a greeting, and link to product information.|
|Business Manager|<li> What was the most popular item last week, month, or last three months, and how many did we sell?<br><li> What was the largest sale order last week, month, or last three months?<br><li> Who, or what, was the busiest resource, and what were the bookings?<br><li> Have sales gone up in the last week, month, or three months, compared to the same period last year?<br><li> What was the biggest sales invoice we posted last week, month, or last three months, and to which customer did we send the bill?</li> |

# EBITDA (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **EBITDA** report provides an overview of your company's performance from the perspective of both earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). You can review EBIT and EBITDA over time to identify trends in operational performance and inform decisions about cost management and pricing strategies.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/ebitda-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the EBITDA report" lightbox="media/finance/ebitda-report.png":::

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Executives
- Directors
- Other high-level decision makers

Executives use the report to evaluate cash flow potential before making strategic decisions. By analyzing EBIT, you can gauge the efficiency with which your core business generates profits from operations. EBITDA excludes both nonoperational costs and noncash expenses, such as depreciation and amortization. Use EBITDA when you compare your business to your peers in the industry.

EBITDA is good for comparing cash flow potential across similar businesses. EBIT offers a fuller picture of profit by including asset-related costs, which is essential for assessing long-term operational efficiency.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *EBITDA* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Operating Profit - EBIT**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#-change-in-operating-profit---ebit)
- [**EBITDA**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#ebitda)
- [**Revenue**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#revenue)
- [**Interest Revenue**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#interest-revenue)
- [**Extraordinary Revenue**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#extraordinary-revenue)

# Convert service contracts that include VAT amounts

Because the VAT rate change tool can't convert service contracts, these contracts must be converted manually. This article describes several alternative methods that you can use for service contract conversion.  

> [!NOTE]  
> This article provides a high-level workflow.  

 The following procedure describes how to correct an invoice for a prepaid service contract that has been created a year in advance.  

> [!NOTE]  
> For this example, you must change your work date to 01.01.2017.  

## To correct an invoice for a prepaid service contract  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contract Management**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Under **Lists**, choose **Service Contracts**.  
3. Create a new prepaid service contract. Enter a start date of **01.01.2017** and an invoice period year for customer **20000**.  
4. To sign the contract, choose the **Sign Contract** action.  
5. Create a service invoice.
6. The invoice is listed as an unposted service invoice. To view the service invoice, choose the **Service** action, choose the **Contract Management** action, and then choose the **Service Invoices** action.  
7. Post the service invoice.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Don't change the unposted service invoice. Since the service ledger entries are created when the invoice is created, a change in the unposted invoice will not change the already created service ledger entries. However, the VAT entries are created when the invoice is posted. This lets you change the general product posting group and the GSP product posting group on the unposted service invoice.  

### To create a credit memo for VAT difference 
 
The following procedure describes how to create a credit memo that only includes the VAT difference for the already invoiced period starting on **01.07.2017**. In this example, the VAT amount is only posted to the Financial Management module, not to the Service Management module. The VAT entries that are linked to the service ledger entry won't be corrected.  

1. Create a new general ledger account for the VAT difference. This account is used for direct posting of the VAT correction.  
2. Add a new line to the VAT posting setup.  

## To create contract expiration dates in contract lines  

The following procedure describes how to create new contracts by working with contract expiration dates in service contract lines.  

1. On the **Service Contract** page, set the contract expiration date to **30.06.2017**.  
2. Choose the **Create Credit Memo** action to automatically create a credit memo for July 2017 to December 2017.  
3. Because the contract has expired, you need to create a new contract for the period with the new VAT rate for July 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017.  

### To create a new credit memo  

The following procedure describes how to create a new credit memo using the **Get Prepaid Contract Entries** batch job. Entries that you don't want to correct from January 2017 to June 2017 will be deleted.  

1. Run the VAT rate change tool on July 1, 2017. The general product posting group or the VAT product posting group is changed. For more information, see [Work with VAT on Sales and Purchases](finance-work-with-vat.md).  
2. After running the VAT rate change tool, enter a contract expiration date for the service contract. You can now delete the service contract line and create a new line that is identical to the old one.  
3. Create a new invoice for the period of January 2017 to December 2012 using the new VAT rate.  
4. To create another credit memo, on the **Service Credit Memos** page, choose the **New** action to create a new service credit memo.  
5. Choose the **Get Prepaid Contract Entries** action.  
6. After the conversion is complete, VAT and service ledger entries will be correct.

# Business Process Walkthroughs

This selection of walkthroughs provides step-by-step, end-to-end business processes that you can perform using the CRONUS demonstration company. The walkthroughs consist of multiple procedures, some of which would normally be performed by one user, while others incorporate several different user roles. In order to simulate the working environment, some of the walkthroughs contain setup steps necessary to complete the exercises as described. These steps can provide insight into the kind of information users need to share with their company's IT professionals.  

 The walkthroughs are complete scenarios, and should be performed from beginning to end for the greatest benefit. Many are based on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] demonstrations, and enable you to try those procedures yourself, at your own pace.  

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the walkthroughs require sample data that is not available in the default demonstration company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. <!--For more information, see [Sandbox Environments](admin-sandbox-environments.md). -->

# Setting up purchasing

Before you can manage purchase processes, you must configure the rules and values that define the company's purchase policies.

You must define the general setup on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page, which is typically done once during the initial implementation. Learn more in the following section, [Purchases, and payables setup](#purchases-and-payables-setup).

A separate series of tasks related to registering new vendors is to record any special price or discount agreements you have with each vendor.

Finance-related purchase setup, such as payment methods and currencies, are covered in the finance setup section. Learn more at [Setting Up Finance](finance-setup-finance.md). Similarly, inventory-related purchase setup, such as units of measure and item tracking codes, can be found in the [Inventory Setup section](inventory-setup-inventory.md).

## Purchases and payables setup

Before working with purchases and payables, specify on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page how purchase values are posted and the number series used for vendors and purchase documents.

### General settings

On the **General** FastTab, you specify options such as how you want to calculate and post discounts and whether you want to round invoices. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].

Some fields require special attention, such as the **Calc. Inv. Disc. per VAT/Tax ID** field, which specifies whether the invoice discount is calculated according to the tax identifier or the invoice total. Learn more at [Combine VAT posting groups in VAT posting setups](finance-setup-vat.md#combine-vat-posting-groups-in-vat-posting-setups).

Similarly, the **Appln. between Currencies** field can result in small rounding differences when applying entries in different currencies to one another. Learn more at [Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies](finance-how-enable-application-ledger-entries-different-currencies.md).

Also, some fields change their behavior or depend on how other fields are set. For example, the **Check Prepmt. when Posting** feature is influenced by how the **Prepmt. Auto Update** field is set to check for pending prepayments.

Read details about the [**Ext. Doc. No. Mandatory**](#external-document-number) and [**Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory**](#exact-cost-reversing) fields in sections later in this article.

### Number series settings

On the **Number Series** FastTab, you must specify unique identification codes to use for vendors, invoices, and other purchase documents. Numbering is important not only for internal processes, but might also need to follow local regulations. So it might be worth considering setting up all series in the **No. Series** page beforehand instead of creating new ones from the **Purchases & Payables Setup**. Learn more at [Create Number Series](ui-create-number-series.md).

## External document number

[!INCLUDE [ext-doc-no-purch](includes/ext-doc-no-purch.md)]

## Exact cost reversing

The **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** function helps ensure returned goods are valued at the same cost as when they were originally drawn from inventory, using a fixed application instead of following an average or first-in, first-out (FIFO) costing method. Learn more in the [Design Details: Fixed Application](design-details-item-application.md#fixed-application) section. If an extra cost is later added to the original purchase, the program updates the value of the respective purchase return.

With the feature enabled, a return transaction can only be posted by specifying the item ledger entry number in the **Appl.-to Item Entry** field on the purchase return order line. By default, the field isn't displayed on the **Lines** FastTab. To learn how to add fields to pages, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode) section.

# Manage attachments, links, and notes on cards and documents

On most list pages, cards, and documents, you can attach files, add links, and write notes on the **Attachments** tab of the **FactBox** pane. The number in the tab title indicates how many attached files, links, or notes exist for the card or document.

On the **Lines** FastTab, you can also use the **Attachments** action to attach documents to a specific line. For example, you might want to attach design specifications to an item on a purchase invoice.

Attachments, links, and notes stay attached to the card or document while it's processed into other states. For example, from an ongoing sales order to a posted sales invoice. However, none of the attachment types are output from the system, for example, when printing or when saving to a file.

You can also add attachments to the emails you send from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you send an email directly from a document, such as a sales quote, the **Add file from source document** action lets you choose files that are attached to it. You can only choose files that are attached to the document. You can't choose files that are attached to lines.

> [!NOTE]
> When you partially ship and invoice a sales or purchase order, the attachment will only be attached to the final invoice of the order. Similarly, when you invoice deferrals, the attachment is attached to the G/L entries for the document but not for the deferral entries.
>
> If you delete an order before it is invoiced, the attachment is also removed.
>
> When you use the **Get Receipt Lines** action on a purchase invoice, the attachment on the related purchase order is added to the purchase invoice.

## To attach a file to a purchase invoice

You can attach any type of file, such as text, image, or video files, to a card, document, or a line on a document. This is useful, for example, when you want to store a vendor's invoice as a PDF file on the related purchase invoice in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> Files attached with the Incoming Documents feature aren't included on the **Attachments** tab. For more information, see [Incoming Documents](across-income-documents.md). The same is true for files that are attached to lines on documents.

The following procedure is based on a purchase invoice. The steps are similar for all other supported documents and cards.

> [!TIP]
> If your attachment is specific to a line on a document, you can attach it to the line. Choose the line, and then choose the **Attachments** action.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the purchase invoice that you want to attach a file to.
3. On the **FactBox** pane, choose the **Attachments** tab.
4. Choose the value behind the **Documents** field, such as "0".
5. On the **Attached Documents** page, in the **Attachment** field.
6. On the **Attach a document** dialog box, do one of the following steps to attach a file:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]

The file is now attached to the purchase invoice.

## To view an attached file

1. On the FactBox, open the **Attachments** tab.
2. Choose the value behind the **Documents** field, such as "1".
3. On the **Attached Documents** page, choose the **Preview** action.
4. Open the downloaded file.

## To save a document as a PDF attachment

Whenever you need to save a document as a file, you can use the **Attach as PDF** action to capture the current document content as a PDF file attached to the FactBox of the document. This is useful, for example, when documents follow multiple steps in a process, such as a sales process or an approval workflow, and you want to refer to a printout of the previous step.

The following procedure is based on a sales order. The steps are similar for all supported documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a sales order, and then choose the **Attach as PDF** action.

A PDF file with the current content of the sales order is added to the **Attachments** tab in the FactBox.

## To add a link from an item card

You can add a link from a card or document to any URL. This is useful, for example, when you want to link an item card with the supplier's item catalog.

The following procedure is based on an item card. The steps are similar for all other supported cards and documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the item that you want to add a link from, and then choose the **Attachments** tab in the FactBox.
3. In the **Links**, choose the **+** icon.
4. In the **Link Address** field, enter the link.

    The link must be a valid internet or intranet URL.

5. In the **Description** field, enter any information about the link.  
6. Choose the **OK** button.

The link is now attached to the item card.  

## To write a note on a sales order

You can write a note on a document or card, for example, to communicate special instructions to other users of the document or card. You can include file links and URLs in notes.

> [!NOTE]
> Notes on the **Attachments** tab are not related to internal notes functionality, which is mainly used to communicate between workflow users. For more information, see [Setting Up Workflow Notifications](across-setting-up-workflow-notifications.md).

The following procedure is based on a sales order. The steps are similar for all other supported documents and cards.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the sales order that you want to write a note on, and then choose the **Attachments** tab in the FactBox.
3. In the **Notes** section, choose the **+** icon.
4. In the **Note** field, write any text, such as "This is an urgent order."
5. Choose the **OK** button.

The note is now attached to the sales order.

# Transfer bank funds

You might sometimes need to transfer an amount from one bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to another. To do this, you must post the transaction on the **General Journals** page. The task varies depending on whether the bank accounts use the same currency or different currencies.

## To post a transfer between bank accounts with the same currency code

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On a journal line, fill in the **Posting Date** and **Document No.** fields.
3. In the **Account Type** field, select **Bank Account**.
4. In the **Account No.** field, select the bank from which you want to transfer the funds.
5. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount to be transferred.

    Next, you must specify the balancing account. If you can't see the relevant fields, then choose the **Show More Columns** action to view all available fields.
6. In the **Bal. Account Type** field, select **Bank Account**.
7. In the **Bal. Account No.** field, select the bank account to which you want to transfer the funds.
8. Post the journal.

## To post a transfer between bank accounts with different currency codes

To transfer funds between bank accounts that use different currencies, you must post two general journal lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create two journal lines, and fill in the **Posting Date** and **Document No.** fields.
3. On the first journal line, in the **Type** field, select **Bank Account**.
4. In the **Account No.** field, select the bank account from which you want to transfer the funds.
5. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount in the currency of the bank account with or without a minus sign.

    > [!TIP]
    > An amount without a sign is a debit, and an amount with a minus sign is a credit.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Some companies prefer to transfer between accounts on separate journal lines. Other companies prefer to post everything on one journal line by using a balancing account. Check with your local expert if you're not sure what to do.
    >
    > If your company prefers to use a balancing account, then set the **Bal. Account Type** field to **Bank Account**, and set the **Bal. Account No.** field to the bank account to which you want to transfer the funds. Then proceed to step 9 or 10.
    >
    > If your company prefers to use a separate journal line, then move on to the next step.
6. On the second journal line, in the **Type** field, select **Bank Account**.
7. In the **Account No.** field, select the bank account to which you want to transfer the funds.
8. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount in the currency of the bank account with or without a minus sign.

    > [!TIP]
    > An amount without a sign is a debit, and an amount with a minus sign is a credit.
9. If the exchange rates used in the journal are different than the exchange rates on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page, enter a new journal line for the exchange rate gain or loss.  

    1. Enter **G/L Account** in the **Account Type** field.  

    2. Enter the G/L account number for exchange rate gain or loss in the **Account No.** field.  

    3. Enter the exchange rate gain or loss in the **Amount** field with or without a minus sign.

    > [!TIP]
    > An amount without a sign is a debit, and an amount with a minus sign is a credit.
10. Post the journal.

# Create number series

For each company that you set up, you need to assign unique identification codes to things such as general ledger accounts, customer and vendor accounts, invoices, and other documents. Numbering isn't only important for identification. A well-designed numbering system also makes the company more manageable and easier to analyze, and can reduce data entry errors.

> [!Important]
> By default, gaps aren't allowed in number series because the exact history of financial transactions must be available for auditing, by law, and therefore must follow an unbroken sequence with no deleted numbers.
>
> If you want to allow gaps in certain number series, consult with your auditor or accounting manager to ensure that you adhere to the legal requirements in your country/region. For more information, see the [Gaps in Number Series](#gaps-in-number-series) section.

> [!NOTE]  
> We recommend that you use the same number series codes as you see listed on the **No. Series List** page in the CRONUS demonstration company. Codes such as *P-INV+* might not make immediate sense to you, but [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has a number of default settings that depend on these number series codes.

You create a numbering system by setting up one or more codes for each type of master data or document. For example, you can set up one code for numbering customers, another code for numbering sales invoices, and another code for numbering documents in general journals. After you set up a code, you must set up at least one number series line. The number series line contains information such as the first and last number in the series and the starting date. You can set up more than one number series line per number series code, with a different starting date for each line. Number series are consecutive, starting each series on the respective starting date.

> [!NOTE]
> The maximum length of a number in a number series is 20 characters. There are some situations where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will append a number with a system-generated ID. For example, when documents such as invoices are used to apply transactions, such as payments, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] generates identifiers for the applied transactions. The identifier is comprised of a number from a number series and a six character system-assigned ID, such as -12345. If you expect to process more than 9999 documents in bank or GIRO journals, or cash receipt journals, set up number series for those types of documents to include fewer than 14 characters.

You typically set up your number series to automatically insert the next consecutive number on new cards or documents that you create. However, you can also set up a number series to allow you to manually enter a number. To manually enter numbers, turn on the **Manual Nos.** toggle.

If you want to use more than one number series code for one type of master data - for example, if you want to use different number series for different categories of items - you can use number series relationships.

## Get assistance from Copilot

The suggest number series with Copilot feature can help administrators create and maintain number series for all entities and documents in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on structured input or natural language. To learn more about this AI-based capability, go to [Suggest number series with Copilot](suggest-number-series-copilot.md).

## Gaps in number series

Not all records that you create in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are financial transactions that must use sequential numbering. For example, you assign number series to customers, sales quotes, and warehouse activities, but they aren't subject to financial auditing and can be deleted. For such number series, you can select the **Allow Gaps in Nos.** checkbox on the **No. Series Lines** page. This setting can also be changed after creating the number series. For more information, see [To create a new number series](ui-create-number-series.md#to-create-a-new-number-series).

## Behavior of the No. field on documents and cards

On sales, purchase, transfer, and service documents, and on all cards, the **No.** field can be filled in automatically from a predefined number series, or you can add it manually. <!--However, under certain circumstances, the **No.** field is invisible to prevent you from editing it.-->

The **No.** field can be filled in three ways:

1. If only one number series for the type of document or card exists, and the **Default Nos.** field is selected and the **Manual Nos.** field isn't selected for that number series, then the field is automatically filled with the next number in the series.<!-- The **No.** field doesn't display on the card or document.-->  

    <!--Even if you define templates with various number series for customers, if the number series that is defined in the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page is set up in this way, the **No.** field doesn't display on the customer card, no matter which template you use. The same applies to other types of cards and documents.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the number series isn't working, for example because it's reached the last number defined for its range, the **No.** field displays so you can manually enter a number. You can resolve issues on the **No. Series** page.-->

2. If you have more than one number series for a type of document or card, and the **Default Nos.** checkbox isn't selected for the assigned number series, the **No.** field displays, and you can go to the **No. Series** page and select the number series you want to use. The next number in the series is then inserted in the **No.** field.

3. If you don't have a number series for a type of document or card, or if the **Manual Nos.** field is selected for the number series, the **No.** field displays and you must enter a number manually. You can enter up to 20 alphanumeric characters.

When you open a new document or card that a number series exists for, the **No. Series Setup** page opens so that you can set up a number series for that type of document or card and continue working.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you need to enable manual numbering on, for example, new item cards that were created with a data migration process that has hidden the **No.** by default, go to the **Inventory Setup** page and choose the **Item Nos.** field to open and set the related number series to **Manual Nos.**.
>
> The same is true if you're using service management features. To resolve that issue, go to the **Service Management Setup** page and choose the **Service Item Nos.** field to set the number series to **Manual Nos.**.

## To create a new number series

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **No. Series**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. On the new line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. Choose the **Lines** action.  
5. On the **No. Series Lines** page, fill in the fields to define the actual use and content of the number series that you created in step 2.  
6. Repeat step 5 for as many different uses of the number series that you need. The **Starting Date** field defines which number series line is active.  

> [!TIP]
> To allow users to specify numbers manually when they register a new customer or vendor, for example, choose the **Manual Nos.** field on the number series itself. To prevent manual numbering, clear the field.

You can assign number series to the templates that you set up for the different types of customers and vendors that your sales people and purchasers most often add. In that case, set up the relevant number series, link them through relationships, and then add the first number series in the relevant relationship to the relevant setup page. Then, when a user creates a customer, they choose the relevant template, and the new customer gets a number assigned from the number series that is defined for that template.  

## To create relationships between number series

If you set up more than one number series for the same kind of information or transactions, you can create relationships between the series. This feature can help you decide among the codes when you use a number. When you set up a relationship between a group of number series, you associate all of the related series to one number series. Then, you can enter that code in a field on the **Numbering** FastTab on setup pages, such as **Sales & Receivables Setup**.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **No. Series**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line with the number series you want to create relationships for and then choose **Relationships**.
3. In the **Series Code** field, enter the code for the number series that you want to relate to the series you selected in step 2.
4. Add a line for each code that you want to relate to the selected number series.
5. Close the page.

Now when you set up something that requires a number, you can use the relationships you created to select among the related number series.

## To set up where a number series is used

The following procedure shows how to set up number series for the Sales area. The steps are similar for other areas.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Sales & Receivables** page, on the **Number Series** FastTab, select the desired number series for each sales card or document.

The selected number now fills in the **No.** field on the card or document according to your settings.

# Warnings and error messages

During your work day, you might see notifications in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that something went wrong, or that it wasn't possible to post something, for example. In many cases, the notification makes it easy to resolve the matter, or to roll back any changes that you made. In other cases, you might not have the information that you need to get unblocked. This article provides tips on how to make progress.  

## In-product user assistance

The default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes descriptions for most fields, columns, and actions that can be accessed when you choose the name. In combination with teaching tips for important pages, descriptive captions, and instructional text, these tooltips, or callouts, are our current implementation of *embedded user assistance*, which is an important principle in today's world of software design.  

If you have a question about a field or another element of the user interface, choose the name to read a short description. Choose the **Ask Copilot** link if that isn't enough. You can also use the in-product Help pane to find answers to your questions.  

For more information, see [Dynamics 365 Business Central User Assistance Model](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/user-assistance) in the administration content for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Help and Support page

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the Help menu item (the question mark in the top right corner) gives you access to the **Help and Support** page, where you can find links to resources that can help you find answers to your questions. For more information, see [Resources for Help and Support](product-help-and-support.md).  

## Help others

If you're an administrator or superuser, you can help others by looking up error messages in the **Error Message Register** page or in the administration center. In many cases, the warning or error message is about setup or lack of permission and similar issues that the superuser or administrator can easily help with. In other cases, you might have to inspect pages to identify the cause. For more information, see [Finding technical information](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/manage-technical-support#finding-technical-information) in the administration content for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Share error details for faster assistance

To overcome obstacles and minimize downtime, apply the expertise of colleagues or subject matter experts. When an error blocks you, you can easily share the error details when you get assistance.

The details include the error message, error code, and other information that's helpful when troubleshooting an error. By sharing the error details, you can effectively communicate the specific issue you're facing, which helps your colleagues help you.  

You can copy details by choosing the **Share icon** in in-line validation dialogs, or the **Share details** menu in error dialogs.  

In addition to copying error details, you can also choose to share details through Microsoft Teams by choosing **Share details to Teams** to do the following:

* Copy the error details.
* Open the **Share to Teams** window, where you can paste the error details you copied and specify who you want to ask for help. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds a link to the page where you experienced the error to make troubleshooting easier.

You can also choose to share details by email by choosing **Share details via email** to do the following:

* Copy the error details.
* Open your default email editor, where you can paste the error details you copied and specify who you want to ask for help. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds a link to the page where you experienced.

## Help yourself

Error messages provide information and actions that make it easier to understand, go to, and resolve errors that come from the platform.

The error messages that the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] platform generates contain the full technical details, including field names, in the **Detailed error message** section. Select the **Copy details** icon on inline validation errors or in an error message to access the technical information.

Actions on error messages take you directly to the page where a field is causing the error. You don't have to take time to find the page or field yourself. To resolve the error, just choose the action in the error message and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] takes you to the appropriate location.

The following video shows how to use actionable error messages to get unblocked.

### Tip for developers

If you're a developer, when you call the [TestField](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods-auto/record/record-testfield-joker-joker-errorinfo-method) method, but don't pass in the |`ErrorInfo` object, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically generates the link to a page where a user can correct the issue. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] first gets the lookup or drill-down page for the record, and then finds the card page or lookup page and adds a navigation link to that card page. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't add a link in the following situations:

* If the error is on the page that's currently open.
* If the user doesn't have permission to modify the underlying record.

# Design details: Inbound warehouse flow

The inbound flow in a warehouse begins when items arrive in the warehouse of the company location, either received from external sources or from another company location. You can receive physical and non-inventory items. To learn more about receiving non-inventory items, go to [Post non-inventory items](#post-non-inventory-items).

In principle, the process of receiving inbound orders consists of two activities:

* Receive items at the dock, identify them, match them to a source document, and record the received quantity.
* Put away items in stock, and record the place you put them.

The source documents for inbound warehouse flow are:

* Purchase orders  
* Inbound transfer orders  
* Sales return orders  

> [!NOTE]
> Production and assembly output also represent inbound source documents. Learn more about handling production and assembly output for internal processes at [Design Details: Internal Warehouse Flows](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).  

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Selecting an approach depends on your company's practices and level of organizational complexity. The following are some examples that might help you decide.

* In an order-by-order warehouse environment, where most of the warehouse staff works directly with order documents, you might decide to use method A. 
* An order-by-order warehouse that has a more complex put-away process, or where warehouse staff separates their put-away activities from the order document, might use method B.
* Companies that need to plan the handling of multiple orders may find it helpful to use warehouse receipt documents, methods C and D.  

In methods A, B, and C, receiving and putting away are combined in one step when posting documents as received. In method D, the receipt is posted first to record the increase of inventory and that items are available for sale. The warehouse worker then registers the put-away to make the items available to pick for outbound orders. 

> [!NOTE]
> While warehouse put-aways and inventory put-aways sound similar, they're different documents and are used in different processes.
> * The inventory put-away used in method B, together with registering put-away information, also posts the receipt of the source document.
> * The warehouse put-away used in method D can't be posted and only registers the put-away. The registration makes the items available for the further processing but doesn't post the receipt. In the inbound flow, the warehouse put-away requires a warehouse receipt.

## No dedicated warehouse activity

The following articles provide information about how to process receipts for source documents if you don't have dedicated warehouse activities.

* [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md)
* [Transfer Orders](inventory-how-transfer-between-locations.md)
* [Process Sales Return Orders](sales-how-process-sales-returns-orders.md)

## Basic warehouse configurations  

In a basic warehouse configuration, the **Require Put-away** toggle is turned on, but the **Require Receipt** toggle is turned off on the **Location Card** page for the location.

The following diagram illustrates the inbound warehouse flows by document type in basic warehouse configurations. The numbers in the diagram correspond with the steps in the sections following the diagram.  

:::image type="content" source="media/design_details_warehouse_management_inbound_basic_flow.png" alt-text="The basic inbound flow in a warehouse.":::

### 1: Release a source document to create a request for an inventory put-away  

When you receive items, release the source document, such as a purchase order or an inbound transfer order. Releasing the document makes the items available to be put away. You can also create inventory put-away documents for individual order lines, in a push fashion, based on bins and quantities to handle.  

### 2: Create an inventory put-away  

On the **Inventory Put-away** page, in a pull fashion, you can get the pending source document lines based on inbound warehouse requests. In a push fashion, you can also create inventory put-away lines when you create the source document.  

### 3: Post an inventory put-away  

On each line for items that have been put away, partially or fully, fill in the **Quantity** field and then post the inventory put-away. Source documents that are related to the inventory put-away are posted as received.  

* Positive item ledger entries are created.
* Warehouse entries are created for locations that require a bin code on all item transactions.
* The put-away request is deleted, if it's fully handled. For example, the **Quantity Received** field on the inbound source document line is updated.
* A posted receipt document is created that reflects the purchase order, for example, and the received items.  

## Advanced warehouse configurations  

To use an advanced warehouse configuration, turn on the **Require Receipt** toggle on the Location Card page for the location. The **Require Put-away** toggle is optional.

The following diagram illustrates the inbound warehouse flow by document type. The numbers in the diagram correspond with the steps in the sections following the diagram.  

:::image type="content" source="media/design_details_warehouse_management_inbound_advanced_flow.png" alt-text="The advanced inbound flow in a warehouse.":::

### 1: Release the source document  

When you receive items, release the source document, such as the purchase order or an inbound transfer order. Releasing the document makes the items available to be put away. The put away will contain references to the source document type and number.

### 2: Create a warehouse receipt  

On the **Warehouse Receipt** page, get the inbound source document lines. You can combine several source document lines in one warehouse receipt document. Fill in the **Qty. to Handle** field and select the receiving zone and bin, if necessary.  

### 3: Post the warehouse receipt  

Post the warehouse receipt to create positive item ledger entries. The **Quantity Received** field on the inbound source document line is updated.  

If the **Require Put-away** toggle is not turned on on the location card, this is where the process stops. Otherwise, posting the inbound source document makes the items available to be put away. The put away contains references the source document type and number.  

### 4: (Optional) Generate put-away worksheet lines

Get warehouse put-away lines in the **Put-away Worksheet** based on posted warehouse receipts or operations that produce output. On the lines you'll put-away, specify the following information:

* The bins to take items from.
* The bins to put items in.
* How many units to handle.

The bins can be predefined by the setup of the warehouse location or the resource that performed the operation.  

When all put-aways are planned and assigned to warehouse workers, generate the warehouse put-away documents. Fully assigned put-away lines are deleted from the **Put-away Worksheet**.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the **Use Put-away Worksheet** toggle is not turned on on the location card, warehouse put-away documents are created directly based on posted warehouse receipts. In that case, this step isn't needed.  

### 5: Create a warehouse put-away document

Create a warehouse put-away document in a pull fashion, based on the posted warehouse receipt. Alternatively, create the warehouse put-away document and assign it to a warehouse worker in a push fashion.  

### 6: Register a warehouse put-away

On each line for items that have been put away, partially or fully, fill in the **Quantity** field on the **Warehouse Put-away** page, and then register the warehouse put-away.  

* Warehouse entries are created for locations that require a bin code on all item transactions.
* The warehouse put-away lines are deleted, if they're fully handled.
* The warehouse put-away document remains open until you register the full quantity of the related posted warehouse receipt.
* The **Qty. Put Away** field on posted warehouse receipt order lines is updated.

# Work with responsibility centers

Responsibility centers provide the ability to handle administrative centers. A responsibility center can be a cost center, a profit center, an investment center, or other company-defined administrative center. Examples of responsibility centers are a sales office, a purchasing department for several locations, and a plant planning office. For example, companies can set up user-specific views of sales and purchase documents related to a particular responsibility center.  

Using multiple locations together with responsibility centers provides the ability to manage business operations in flexible, optimal ways.

Multiple locations allow companies to manage their inventory in multiple locations using one database. Two concepts, locations and stockkeeping units, are the cornerstones of this granule. A location is defined as a place that handles physical placement and quantities of items. The concept is broad enough to include locations such as plants or production facilities and distribution centers, warehouses, showrooms, and service vehicles. A stockkeeping unit is defined as an item at a specific location and/or as a variant. Using stockkeeping units, companies with multiple locations can add replenishment information, addresses, and some financial posting information at the location level. As a result, they can replenish variants of the same item for each location and order items based on location-specific replenishment information.  

## To set up a responsibility center

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Responsibility Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    If you're using responsibility centers to administer your company, it can be useful to have a default responsibility center.
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.
5. On the **Shipping** FastTab, in the **Responsibility Center** field, enter a responsibility center code.

This code is used on all purchase, sales, or service documents, if the user, customer, or vendor has no default responsibility center. On sales, purchase, or service documents, you can enter another responsibility center than the default.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you enter a responsibility center code on a document, it affects the address, dimensions, and prices on the document.  

## To assign responsibility centers to users

You can set up users so that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] retrieves only the documents relevant for their particular work areas. Users are associated with one responsibility center and work only with documents related to specific application areas at that particular center.  

To set this up, you assign responsibility centers to users in three functional areas: Purchases, Sales, and Service Management.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **User Setup** page, select the user you want to assign a responsibility center to. If the user not is on the list, you must enter a user ID in the **User ID** field.  
3. In the **Sales Resp. Ctr. Filter** field, enter the responsibility center where the user will have tasks related to sales.  
4. In the **Purchase Resp. Ctr. Filter** field, enter the responsibility center where the user will have tasks related to purchasing.  
5. In the **Service Resp. Ctr. Filter** field, enter the responsibility center where the user will have tasks related to service management.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Users can view only those posted documents that related to their own responsibility center. However, they can view all ledger entries and navigate to other posted documents from the ledger entries.

# The Payments and Reconciliations (DK) Extension

Make fast, error-free payments by exporting files that are formatted specifically for exchanges with your vendor or bank. These files speed up the payment and reconciliation processes, and eliminate errors that can happen when you manually enter the information on a bank website.  

This extension supports file formats for several Danish banks. When you export payment information to a file, the extension packages the data into the format that your bank requires. For example, the formats include Bankdata-V3, BEC, SDC, and FIK, which many different banks use, and some that are more specialized for certain banks, for example, Danske Bank and Nordea. The extension also includes some formats for importing and reconciling bank statements.  

> [!Note]
> To use the extension, you must know the format that your bank or vendor requires. Some banks or vendors provide this information on their websites; however, you might need to contact their customer service to get the information.  

## Supported Bank Formats
This extension can apply the following file formats for payment files:  

* BANKDATA-V3  
* BEC-INDLAND  
* BEC-CSV  
* DANSKEBANK-CMKV  
* DANSKEBANK-CMKXKSX  
* DANSKEBANK  
* FIK71  
* NORDEA-ERHVERV-CSV  
* NORDEA  
* NORDEA-UNITEL-V3  
* SDC  
* SDC-CSV  

## To set up the extension

There are a few steps to get started.  

* Allow payment data exports. To help protect your data, this is not readily available.  
* Set up purchase and payables so that you do not require external document numbers on invoices. If needed, you can use the reference number to refer to a specific invoice.  
* Specify the payment method for each vendor. Payment methods define how you pay invoices from the vendor. For example, Bank, Cash, Check, or Account.  
* Specify the type of format to use for each of your bank accounts. For example, NORDEA, DANSKEBANK, SDC, and so on.  

Additionally, you must assign vendors to a domestic **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** and a **Vendor Posting Group**. The Country/Region setting for the vendor must be Denmark (DK). For more information, see [Setting Up Posting Groups](finance-posting-groups.md).  

### To allow [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to export payment data

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journal**, and then choose the related link.

title: Mapping the tables and fields to synchronize

# Mapping the tables and fields to synchronize

The basis of synchronizing data is mapping the tables and fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with tables and columns in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], so they can exchange the data. Mapping happens through integration tables.

## Mapping integration tables

An integration table is a table in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database that represents a table, such as an account, in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Integration tables include fields that correspond to columns in the [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table. For example, the Account integration table connects to the Accounts table in [!INCLUDE[cds_short_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. There must be an integration table mapping for each table in [!INCLUDE[cds_short_md](includes/cds_short_md.md)] that you want to synchronize with data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

When you create the connection between the apps, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] sets up some default mappings. You can change the table mappings if you want. For more information, see [Standard Table Mapping for Synchronization](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#standard-table-mapping-for-synchronization). If you changed the default mappings and want to revert your changes, on the **Integration Table Mappings** page, choose **Use Default Synchronization Setup**.

> [!Note]
> If you are using an on-premises version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the integration table mappings are stored in table 5335 Integration Table Mappings, where you can view and edit the mappings. Complex mappings and synchronization rules are defined in codeunit 5341.

> [!TIP]
> When a coupled record changes, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically synchronizes the data with Dataverse. Automatic synchronization is great in most cases. However, frequent changes to large amounts of coupled records in a table can slow down data synchronization.
>
> To avoid slow performance, on the **Integration Table Mappings** page, you can enable or disable event-based data synchronization for any table. By default, event-based synchronization is turned on so that existing integrations aren’t affected. Your administrator can turn it on or off for specific tables.

### Add table and field mappings to existing integration tables

[!INCLUDE [preview](includes/preview.md)]

On the **Integration Table Mappings** page, you can use the New Table Mapping action to add new table mappings to integration tables. The action starts the **Create new integration mappings** assisted setup guide, which helps you set up new integration table and field mappings.

The guide lets you map the tables in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with existing integration tables in Dataverse. You can also specify the Dataverse table's unique identifier in **Integration Table Unique Identifier Field Name** and the **Integration Table Modified on Field Name**, which are needed for data synchronization to work.

> [!NOTE]
> The lookup on the Table column shows all [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables, including custom tables, that aren't yet mapped. It excludes those that already exist on your Integration Table Mappings page. The lookup on the Integration Table column shows only Dataverse tables (AL Proxy Tables) that are part of out-of-the-box integrations. To add additional or custom Dataverse tables, you'll need help from a developer to create and deploy them through an extension.

The Advanced action opens extra table mapping settings that you can set up. In the **Advanced** section, the **Table Filter** field lets you specify filters for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Use the **Integration Table Filter** field for Dataverse data to consider in data synchronization together with the configuration template codes in **Table Config. Template Code** and **Int. Tbl. Config. Code** to prefill missing data when new data comes from either application.

The guide also helps you specify the fields you want the new mapping to contain. You can match a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] field in the **Field Name** column with a Dataverse field name in the **Integration Field Name** column. You can also specify a **Direction**, whether the field always has the same value in the **Constant** column, and whether validations or transformations need to be applied during field mapping.

> [!NOTE]
> To reduce errors, the lookup for the **Integration Table Field** column filters to a list of available fields. To map fields that the filters don't include, you'll need help from a developer.
>
> * Fields must be enabled.
> * You can't use the guide to map FlowField and FlowFilter fields.
> * You can only map fields of the type BigInteger, Boolean, Code, Date, DateFormula, DateTime, Decimal, Duration, GUID, Integer, Option, and Text.

> [!TIP]
> You can also add new field mappings to existing integration table mappings through the **Integration Field Mappings** list page, which you can access by choosing **Fields** on the **Integration Table Mappings** page.
>
> Simply choose **New Field Mapping** to open the field mapping step of the **Create new integration mappings** assisted setup guide, and then proceed as described in this article.

New field mappings you add to an existing table mapping are in a Disabled state. You can choose **Edit List** to enable them later.

### Synchronization rules

An integration table mapping also includes rules that control how integration synchronization jobs synchronize records in a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and a table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For examples of rules for an integration with Sales, go to [Synchronization Rules](#synchronization-rules).

### Strategies for autoresolving conflicts

Data conflicts can easily occur when business applications exchange data on an ongoing basis. For example, someone might delete or change a row in one of the applications, or both. To reduce the number of conflicts to manually resolve, you can specify resolution strategies. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically resolves conflicts according to the rules in the strategies.

Integration table mappings include rules that control how synchronization jobs synchronize records. On the **Integration Table Mapping** page, in the **Resolve Deletion Conflicts** and **Resolve Update Conflicts** columns, you can specify how [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] resolves conflicts that occur because records were deleted in tables in one or the other business application, or updated in both. 

In the **Resolve Deletion Conflicts** column, you can choose to have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically restore deleted records, remove the coupling between the records, or do nothing. If you do nothing, you must manually resolve conflicts. 

In the **Resolve Update Conflicts** column, you can choose to have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically send a data update to the integration table when sending data to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], or to get a data update from the integration table when getting data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], or do nothing. If you do nothing, you must manually resolve conflicts.

After you specify the strategy, on the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page, you can choose the **Retry All** action to automatically resolve conflicts.

## Mapping integration fields

Mapping tables is only the first step. You must also map the fields on the tables. Integration field mappings link fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables with corresponding columns in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], and determine whether to synchronize data in each table. The standard table mapping that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides includes field mappings, but you can change the mappings. For more information, see [Viewing Table Mappings](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#tip-for-admins-viewing-table-mappings).

> [!Note]
> If you are using an on-premises version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], integration field mappings are defined in table 5336 Integration Field Mapping.

You can manually map the fields, or you can automate the process by mapping multiple fields at the same time based on criteria for matching their values. For more information, see [To couple multiple records based on field value matching](admin-how-to-couple-and-synchronize-records-manually.md).

### Handle differences in field values

Sometimes the values in the fields that you want to map are different. For example, in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] the language code for the United States is "U.S.," but in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] it's "US." That means you must transform the value when you synchronize data. You can specify transformation rules for the fields on the **Integration Table Mappings** page by choosing **Mapping**, and then **Fields**. Predefined rules are provided, but you can also create your own. For more information, see [Transformation Rules](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md#transformation-rules).

### Handle missing option values

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contains option set columns that provide values that you can map to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fields of the type **Option** for automatic synchronization. During synchronization, nonmapped options are ignored and the missing options are appended to the related [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and added to the **CDS Option Mapping** system table to be handled manually later. For example, by adding the missing options in either product and then updating the mapping. For more information, see [Handling Missing Option Values](admin-cds-missing-option-values.md).

## Couple records

Coupling links rows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are typically coupled with customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Coupling records offers the following benefits:

* It makes synchronization possible.
* Users can open records or rows in one business app from the other.

Coupling requires that the apps are already integrated.

Couplings can be set up automatically by using the synchronization jobs, or manually by editing the record in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Synchronizing Data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md) and [Couple and Synchronize Records Manually](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#synchronize-individual-table-mappings).

## Filter records and rows  

If you don't want to synchronize all rows for a specific table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] or table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can set up filters to limit the data that is synchronized. You set up filters on the **Integration Table Mappings** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Integration Table Mappings**, and then choose the related link.
2. To filter the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records, set the **Table Filter** field.  
3. To filter the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] rows, set the **Integration Table Filter** field.  

## Create new records  

By default, only coupled records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and rows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are synchronized by the integration synchronization jobs. You can set up table mappings to create new records or rows in the destination app for each row in the source app that isn't already coupled.  

For example, the SALESPEOPLE - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job uses the table mapping SALESPEOPLE. The synchronization job copies data from users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to salespersons in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you set up the table mapping to create new records, for every user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] that isn't already coupled to a salesperson in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a new salesperson row is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

### To create new records during synchronization  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Integration Table Mappings**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the table mapping entry in the list, clear the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** field.  

## Use configuration templates on table mappings

You can specify one or more configuration templates to use for new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records, and another template to use new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] rows.  

If you install the default synchronization setup, most of the time, two configuration templates are automatically created and used on the table mapping for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] accounts: **CDSCUST** and **CDSACCOUNT**.  

* **CDSCUST** creates and synchronizes new customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on accounts in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].  

     To create this template, copy an existing configuration template for customers. The **CDSCUST** is created only if there's an existing configuration template and the **Currency Code** field in the template is blank. If a field in the configuration template contains a value, the value replaces the value in the mapped column for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account. For example, if the **Country/Region** column in an account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contains *U.S.* and the **Country/Region** field in the configuration template is **GB**, then **GB** is used as the **Country/Region** for the customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

* **CDSACCOUNT** creates and synchronizes new accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] based on an account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

You can add more templates, and use filters to define conditions under which [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] applies them. The templates apply to data moving in either direction. For example, you might use a template for domestic customers in the United States, and another for foreign customers in the European Union, or vice versa. In that case, when the data synchronizes, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the country/region code for the customer to apply the appropriate template.

### To specify configuration templates on a table mapping  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Integration Table Mappings**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the table mapping entry in the list, in the **Table Config Templates** field, choose to the configuration template to use for new records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  
3. If you have multiple templates, to define the conditions that determine when to use the template, enter criteria in the **Integration Table Filter** field, and then enter a number in the **Priority** field. The priority determines the order in which [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] evaluates whether to use the templates.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Table Config Template Code** and **Int. Tbl. Config Template Code** fields show different values depending on the number of templates that you configure for a specific integration table mapping:
   >
   > * If you configure a single configuration template, the name of the configuration template shows in order to stay compatible with current capabilities.
   > * If you configure multiple configuration templates, the number of configured configuration templates shows.

4. Set the **Int. Tbl. Config Template Code** field to the configuration template to use for new records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

# Enabling new and upcoming features ahead of time

Some new features can be enabled ahead of time, letting you take advantage of them as early as possible. Enabling features early gives you the time to test and prepare your organization for change.

When Microsoft releases features or feature design improvements as part of minor updates, some of the features aren't immediately enabled. Administrators can enable each feature from the **Feature Management** page. After a feature is enabled, it becomes available for all users on that environment no matter how they access [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Features can be safely turned off again. These features are only optional for a while.

Learn more in [Feature Management](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

# Inventory by Location (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Inventory by Location** outlines inventory levels across an organization's locations. It provides an accurate picture of each location and the inventory levels broken down by category and item.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/inventory-by-location.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inventory by Location Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/inventory-by-location.png":::

## Use the report

The report is designed for management teams in warehousing and supply chain management.

Warehouse managers can use the report to check whether each location has appropriate stock levels. This information can help identify whether a location is low or high on stock, and show where you can move stock around where required.

For supply chain managers, the report provides information about where you store each item. With this information, you can make informed decisions about shipping and ensure that items are delivered on time and at the lowest cost.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Inventory by Location* report includes the following KPIs:

- [**Inventory (Quantity)**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#inventory-quantity)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)] 


## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Item
- Item Ledger Entries

# Marketing text suggestions with Copilot overview

<!--[!INCLUDE[ai-preview](includes/ai-preview.md)]-->

This article gives an overview the AI-powered capability provided by Copilot in Business Central.

## What is AI-powered item marketing text with Copilot

Copilot provides AI-powered writing assistance for Business Central users responsible for authoring marketing text (product descriptions) on items sold in online shops, like Shopify. With the click of a button, Copilot generates text that's engaging and creative, and that highlights key attributes of the specific item. With a bit of reviewing and editing, it's ready to publish.

Copilot uses Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service to access language models that recognize, predict, and generate text that's based on trained datasets. Learn more at [Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview).

*The video doesn't exactly reflect how the feature currently works or looks in the product. The feature has changed since the video was produced. But it gives you a general idea of the feature and what you can use it for.*
  
## Where it's used

Copilot is available on item cards in Business Central. In Business Central, items are like products in other applications and shops. Each item can be managed from a card where you enter details about the item, like its dimensions, cost, or picture. This card also includes a box for entering marketing text. This marketing text can be published to your online shop to promote the item. Here's where Copilot comes in. By just selecting the **Draft with Copilot** action on the item card, Copilot will generate an intelligent draft text for you. Once you get the first draft, you can run Copilot again and again until you get a draft you like. When you have suggestion you like, you review and edit it for accuracy, then save it.

If Business Central is set up to connect to your online store on Shopify, you can take this text even further by publishing it with the item directly to your store by selecting **Add to Shopify**.

## Why and how to use it

AI-generated text can help you accelerate the time-to-market of products in online shops by limiting time used on copy writing. Some key benefits include:

- Helps users overcome writer's block by getting them started with an intelligent draft.
- Unlocks creativity to provide more engaging product descriptions.
- Improves consistency of marketing content for product lines.

You should consider the AI-generated text as a *suggestion only*. Suggestions can, in some cases, contain mistakes and even inappropriate text, so human oversight and review are required. Before you make the text publicly available, you must review it for accuracy and make appropriate changes.

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support.md](includes/copilot-language-support.md)]

## Current limitations

Poor suggestions can result when vague or generic product names are used and specifics about an item are missing, like key attributes or a category.

<!-- Partner extensibility of the AI capability by using AL code isn't supported.-->

## Next steps

To get started, you'll need a Business Central (v23.1 and later) environment that's enabled with Copilot.

- If you're an existing Business Central customer, your Business Central admin will have to set up an environment that's enabled for marketing text suggestions. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

- If you're not a Business Central customer but want to try it out, you can sign up for a free trial. Learn more in [Sign up for a free Dynamics 365 Business Central trial](trial-signup.md).

Once you have an environment or trail that ready, go to [Add marketing text to items with Copilot](item-marketing-text.md).

# FAQ for bank account reconciliation assist with Copilot

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Microsoft Copilot assistance with bank account reconciliation in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What is bank reconciliation assist?

Bank reconciliation is a common accounting task where organizations review their bank account statements to identify transactions that should be registered in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this task is used to identify periodic bank fees or small employee expenses.

Bank reconciliation is typically a multi-step process. First, bank statements are imported into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Next, transactions are matched with ledger entries. Finally, new ledger entries are posted to reflect any residual transactions that weren't previously known to your ledgers.

Copilot in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reduces the manual effort by matching more transactions and suggesting general ledger (G/L) accounts that you can post to.

## What are the capabilities of bank reconciliation assist?

Copilot provides AI-powered assistance with two distinct tasks:

- Improved matching of transactions with ledger entries

    [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers automated rules that automatically match many bank transactions with ledger entries. However, these rules are inflexible and often result in many unmatched transactions, each of which requires manual inspection and comparison. Copilot uses AI technology to inspect those unmatched transactions and identify more matches, based on the dates, amounts, and descriptions. For example, if a customer paid multiple invoices in one lump sum, Copilot reconciles the single bank statement line with the multiple invoice ledger entries.

- Suggested G/L accounts

    For residual bank transactions that can't be matched to any ledger entries, Copilot uses AI technology to compare the transaction description with G/L account names and then suggest the most likely G/L account to post to. For example, if unmatched transactions have the narrative *Fuel Stop 24*, Copilot might suggest that you post them to the *Transportation* account.

Copilot doesn't connect to your bank to retrieve or send transactions. This task remains fully within your control. It's a prerequisite for using Copilot's assistance, regardless of whether the transactions are added to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by using a digital bank connection, imported from a bank statement file, or manually entered.

## What is the intended use of bank reconciliation assist?

Bank account reconciliation assist is designed to improve the accuracy of ledgers by helping customers identify new transactions that they should account for in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. It isn't intended for fraud detection or to identify whether customers paid on time.

## How was bank reconciliation assist evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

Bank account reconciliation assist was tested by using combinations of synthetic bank transaction data and similar G/L accounts and ledger entries that cover the typical variations and data limits for each field and in different languages. Test data represents both typical usage and usage by bad actors. Performance was measured in comparison to manual reconciliation of the same data.

## What are the limitations of bank reconciliation assist? How can users minimize the impact of these limitations when they use the system?

Bank account reconciliation assist performs best when G/L account names, ledger entry descriptions, and bank transaction descriptions are all in the same language. Mixed languages or mixed languages for transaction descriptions often result in fewer matches and suggestions.

Suggested ledger accounts performs best in one of the supported languages (see the next section for a list of languages). Users might experience fewer transaction matches and fewer suggested ledger accounts in other languages.

## In which geographies and languages is bank reconciliation assist available? 

[!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability.md)]

## What is expected of system users when they operate bank account reconciliation assist?

### During bank account reconciliation

AI-powered matches and suggestions might sometimes be incorrect or incomplete. Users of bank account reconciliation assist must review the accuracy of the matches and suggestions that Copilot provides before they choose to keep them. Copilot's matches and suggestions aren't saved to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database until you select the **Keep it** button and close the Copilot window. You can edit and correct any matches or suggestions before you choose to keep them.

### After bank account reconciliation is completed

We recommend that users also verify accuracy and correct any discrepancies after they close the Copilot window. This process should include the following activities:

- Review the reconciliation test report.
- Ensure that your organization has the appropriate review and audit processes in place.
- Reopen any posted reconciliations by using the **Undo** function.
- Correct any erroneous ledger entries through reverse posting of entries.

## What is expected of administrators and system users when they operate bank account reconciliation assist?

System users, such as accountants, treasurers, or other people who work on business accounting, should always review the accuracy of matches and suggestions that Copilot provides before they choose to keep them. After reconciliation with Copilot, we recommend that these users review the reconciliation test report to verify accuracy and identify any discrepancies.

Administrators should ensure that the appropriate accounting users are granted access to this capability.

## Is Copilot the only means of completing bank account reconciliation?

No. Use of Copilot is optional. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers traditional, non-AI-powered means of importing bank statements, running predefined matching rules, and manually applying matches and posting to appropriate ledger accounts. Both the traditional approach and Copilot can be used simultaneously in an organization.

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?

Each time that Copilot provides matches or suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window by using the like (thumbs up) and dislike (thumbs down) controls. Your feedback remains anonymous, and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

# Analyze cash flow in your company
The charts on the Accountant Role Center provide insights that can help you make solid decisions about what to do with your cash.  

| To answer questions like these | Use this chart |
| --- | --- |
| How long does the sales process tie up my cash?</br> Should I increase or reduce inventory levels? |Cash Cycle |
| When did cash move in and out of my company?</br> Are some periods better than others? |Cash Flow |
| Do the numbers seem off for a period?</br> Should I investigate? |Income & Expense |
| When might a cash surplus or deficit happens?</br> Should I pay down debt, or borrow to meet upcoming expenses? |Cash Flow Forecasts |

On the Accountant Role Center, under **Finance Performance**, the **Cash Cycle**, **Cash Flow**, and **Income & Expense** charts offer ways to analyze cash flow:  

* See figures for a period by using the timeline slider.  
* Filter the chart by choosing the source in the legend.  
* Change the length of the period, or go to the previous or next period, by choosing options on the **Finance Performance** drop down.  
* View the entries by choosing a point in the chart. For example, a point on the timeline or a column segment. If the numbers seem off, this is where you can make adjustments.  

Although it's separate, the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart is similar. You view details, filter results, and change what is displayed in the same ways. If you change a setting, you can refresh the forecast by choosing **Cash Flow Forecast**, and then **Recalculate Forecast**.

If you want to examine the forecast, in addition to forecast entries, you can also look at the cash flow worksheet. For example, you can see how the forecast:

* Handles confirmed sales and purchases.  
* Subtracts payables and adds receivables.  
* Skips duplicate sales orders and purchase orders.  

## To view a cash flow worksheet

1. Search for **Cash Flow Forecasts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose a cash flow forecast, and then choose the **Cash Flow Worksheet** action.  
3. On the **Cash Flow Worksheet** page, choose the **Suggest Worksheet Lines** action.

# Moving Annual Total (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Moving Annual Total (MAT)** report calculates a total of sales over the last 12 months. This is a rolling calculation where the date is continually moving.

The report showcases the sales amount moving annual total (MAT), and compares it to the MAT for the previous period.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-moving-annual-total.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Moving Annual Total Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-moving-annual-total.png":::

## How to use the report

Business leaders and managers use the report to identify how the MAT is performing across the period.

Business leaders can use the report to monitor the overall sales performance of your organization over the last 12 months. By analyzing the [Moving Annual Total (MAT)](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-mat-fiscal) and [Previous Year Moving Annual Total (PYMAT)](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-pymat-fiscal) figures, you can identify trends in sales growth and compare your organization's performance to the previous year. You can also use the [Moving Annual Total Growth Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg-fiscal) and [Growth %](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg--fiscal) figures to identify periods that performed well or didn't meet the growth expectation.

For example, if you notice that your organization's sales growth is stagnant or declining, you can use this information to develop a plan that focuses on improving sales and increasing marketing efforts during these periods.

Sales managers can use the report to analyze sales data over the last 12 months and gain insights into sales trends. By drilling down into the sales figures for specific categories, you can identify areas of strength and weakness in your sales performance. For example, you might notice that sales of some items have declined over the last few months while the sales of other items are increasing.

The monthly analysis helps you identify when sales started to decline and take necessary actions to introduce products that align with the new trend to increase sales and meet customer demand. With this information, you can make data-driven decisions to optimize your sales strategy and drive revenue growth for your company.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Moving Annual Total (MAT)**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-mat-fiscal)
- [**Previous Year Moving Annual Total (PYMAT)**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-pymat-fiscal)
- [**Moving Annual Total Growth Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg-fiscal)
- [**Moving Annual Total Growth %**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg--fiscal)
- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)

# Process sales quotes and orders with Sales Order Agent (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how to use the Sales Order Agent to automate taking sales orders based on customer inquiries about products/items received via email.

The Sales Order Agent monitors a designated mailbox for incoming customer emails about item inquiries. When it identifies a potential request, it starts converting the request into an order. For example, it verifies the customer, checks item availability, creates a sales quote, and prepares an email response to the customer with the quote as a PDF attachment.

Some steps require your intervention, such as reviewing email correspondence and assisting the agent as needed. Until an order is created, the agent handles email exchanges with the customer to resolve any missing details and allow for modifications to the original request if necessary.

Learn more about the Sales Order Agent and its process flow in [Sales Order Agent overview](sales-order-agent.md#how-the-agent-processes-requests).

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]
<!--[!INCLUDE [limited-public-preview](includes/limited-public-preview.md)]-->

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[soa-language-support](includes/soa-language-support.md)]

## Prerequisites

The Sales Order Agent is activated, and you have permission to use it. Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md).

## Get started

You collaborate with the Sales Order Agent to review and convert quotes into orders using the **Tasks** tab in the **Copilot** pane.

To access this view, select ![Shows Sales Order Agent icon.](media/soa-activated-number-icon.png) **Sales Order Agent** on the upper right of the navigation menu. A red circle with a number on the icon indicates the tasks that need attention.

![Shows the task view with steps](media/soa-task-view-callouts.png)

The ![Shows the task view icon](media/sot-task-view-icon.png) **Tasks** tab opens in the **Copilot** pane to display tasks recently created by the Sales Order Agent. Tasks that require attention&mdash;like reviewing an incoming or outgoing email&mdash;are at the top of the list.  

For each sales quote request, the Sales Order Agent adds a task to track, review, and follow up on updates, eventually processing the quote into an order. Tasks can consist of multiple steps that form a timeline of the process.

> [!TIP]
> Hover over the ![Shows Sales Order Agent icon with an open action.](media/soa-activated-icon.png) **Sales Order Agent** icon in the role or select the ![Show summary for Sales Order Agent icon](media/soa-summary-icon.png) **Show summary for Sales Order Agent** in the **Task** tab to get an overview of the agent's KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) summarizing the impact of the agent's work in your organization. For example, view the number of sales quotes or orders created by the agent, the time saved by your team, and the total number of sales orders created.

## Review and assist

While the agent does the bulk of work autonomously, it asks for user intervention when required for various steps to move through the process, such as:

- Reviewing and confirming incoming email requests from customers.
- Reviewing and confirming the sales quotes and orders if an admin configured the Sales Order Agent to do so.
- Reviewing outgoing emails created by the Sales Order Agent for the customer.
- Providing assistance to the Sales Order Agent when it needs to get unblocked, for example to provide missing data.

Steps requiring intervention are listed under **Needs Attention** in the **Tasks** tab. To review a step:

1. In **Task** tab, select the step requesting review or assistance.

   The task *timeline* opens, focused on the selected step. The timeline displays each step of a task, past and present, in chronological order.

1. Select **Review** for the step.

   The **Tasks** tab switches to **Review** mode, and the Agent Task Message window opens to display the email contents or quote or order, depending on the task.

1. Review the email contents or the quote or order and make changes as needed. You can't edit incoming emails from the customer.

1. When you're satisfied with the content and want the process to continue, select **Confirm** in the **Review** pane. If you want to complete the task yourself, select **Stop** to halt the agent's processing of this task.

After confirmation, the Sales Order Agent continues processing the task. When a new notification appears on the Sales Order Agent icon after some time, follow the same flow to verify and approve the results.

## Modify sales quotes and orders

You might need to modify sales quotes or orders created by the agent during a review step or when the agent requests assistance, based on its configuration. When you select **Review**, the quote or order opens for inspection. Make changes as needed, then select **Confirm** in the **Review** pane. The agent processes the document, creating a PDF for the outgoing email to the customer.

You also have the opportunity to modify a quote or order during the review step for an outgoing email. In this case, select **...** (More options) > **Discard step** on the step. This action stops the task temporarily to allow you to open the quote or order and makes changes and then resume the step.

![Shows the discard step acion on a sales order agent task.](media/soa-discard-step.png)

> [!NOTE]
> **Discard step** is available only on review steps for outgoing emails.

After you make the changes, return to the **Tasks** tab, select one of the following options for resuming the task, and then select **Send**:

- **I have updated the quote** or **I have updated the order** - Select one of these options if you made changes to the quote or order. The agent generates a new PDF and email for the customer.
- **Just resume** - Select this option if you didn't change the quote or order. The agent doesn't generate a new quote or order and keeps the original email as before.  

![Shows the resume step acion on a sales order agent task.](media/soa-resume-step.png)

If you change your mind while reviewing the outgoing message and decide to make more changes to the sales document, use the **Discard step** action to discard the email message generated by the agent. Then, update the sales document as needed and instruct the agent to create a new outgoing email with the updated attachment.

## Assist with item availability

Depending on the agent's setup, it can check item availability in the requested quantity before adding them to a quote or order. You can't change the items and quantities at this point, but you can review and confirm the step so the agent creates a reply email to the customer.

<!--
1. Select **Review** to open the **Items availability** page.
1. Use the page to verify that the item isn't available in the requested quantity.
1. Select **Confirm**.

   The agent creates the reply email for review.-->

Learn more in [Item availability in Sales Order Agent (preview)](sales-order-agent-item-availability.md).

## Stop a task

Most steps of a task include a **Stop** button that lets you terminate the process. When you select **Stop**, a task isn't terminated immediately—you're asked to confirm before the task is stopped.

Before you stop a task, consider the following behavior:

- Stopped tasks can't be restarted.
- Stopping the task might leave some results incomplete or unwanted, and it might require follow-up actions with the customers. Follow up actions depend on where in the process the task was stopped.

  For example, suppose you stopped a task after a sales quote was created. Although the process stopped, the sales quote is still stored in the system as open. You might have to manually edit the state depending on your company policy and then update the customer.
- Stopped tasks aren't deleted immediately. You can still explore a task's timeline until it's deleted, typically by an administrator.

## View timeline and details of steps

From the ![Shows the task view icon](media/sot-task-view-icon.png) **Tasks** view, you can view the details of each step of a task in chronological order. Click on the task or select **...** (More options) > **Show Details**.-->

## Scenarios impacting reliability in handling customer requests

- You might need to correct the quantities in the created document when non-base units of measurement differ from the standard ones.  

  For example, if the system treats 1 kilogram as 900 grams and a customer requests 2 kilograms, the system might generate a document showing 2,000 grams instead of 1,800 grams or 2 kilograms.

- Reliability decreases if you significantly change the email the agent drafts about item availability before sending it to the customer.

  This issue is more apparent when the external customer follows up with an email using pronouns like "them" or "it" and other words instead of repeating specific quantities and names. For example, the customer replies, "I want them all."

- The agent searches for items using item attributes, but the attributes aren't shown to the agent on the item availability page. This condition decreases reliability for customer requests that depend specifically on the attributes.

  Consider the following example:

  1. Items in the database:
  
     `[{no: ITEM-1, description: Shirt, attributes: Linen}, {no: ITEM-2, description: Shirt, attributes: Cotton}]`

  2. Customer's initial request email:

     `I want a quote for nice shirts`

  3. Agent's reply email:
  
     `We have X quantity of ITEM-1 Shirt and ITEM-2 Shirt`

  4. Customer's response email:
  
     `I want the ones with linen material`

- Reliability decreases when the agent retrieves information from multiple email exchanges with a customer, and the customer uses pronouns or vague references like "that," "them," or "it" in their requests.

# Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry Compared to the Source Entry

This article compares the Posting Date on the Adjustment Value Entry with the Posting Date on the entry causing the running of the Adjust Cost - Item Entries batch job, in particular a Revaluation scenario and an Item Charge scenario.

The **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job will process your data depending on your scenario and configuration of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In this section, we describe two separate processes, and for each one we show the type of impact the Adjust Cost - Item Entries batch job has on the data.

## Revaluation scenario

### Prerequisites  

Please enter the following values:

**Inventory setup**:  

- Automatic Cost Posting = Yes  

- Automatic Cost Adjustment = Always  

- Average Cost Calc. Type = Item  

- Average Cost Period = Day  

**General Ledger Setup**:  

- Allow Posting From = January 1, 2021  

- Allow Posting To = Empty  

**User Setup**:  

- Allow Posting From = December 1, 2020  

- Allow Posting To = Empty  

### To test the scenario

Test this scenario by carrying out the following steps.

1. Create an **Item** called TEST with the following values:  

     - Base unit of measure = PCS  

     - Costing Method = Average  

     - Select optional posting groups.  

2. Open an **Item Journal**, then create a new entry, and post a line as follows:  

     - Posting Date = December 15, 2020  

     - Item = TEST  

     - Entry Type = Purchase  

     - Quantity = 100  

     - Unit Amount = 10  

3. Open an **Item Journal**, then create a new entry, and post a line as follows:  

     - Date = December 20, 2020  

     - Item = TEST  

     - Entry Type = Negative Adjustment  

     - Quantity = 2  

4. Open an **Item Journal**, then create a new entry, and post a line as follows:  

     - Date = January 15, 2021  

     - Item = TEST  

     - Entry Type = Negative Adjustment  

     - Quantity = 3  

5. Open an **Item Revaluation Journal**, then create a new entry, and post a line as follows:  

     - Item = TEST  

     - Applies-to Entry = select Purchase entry posted at step 2. The Posting Date of the revaluation will be the same as the entry it adjusts.  

     - Unit Cost (Revalued) = 40  

The following **Item Ledger** and **Value Entries** have been posted:

The **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job has recognized a change in cost and adjusted the Negative Adjustments.  

**Review of Posting Dates on created adjustment value entries:** The earliest allowed Posting Date the Adjust Cost - Item Entries batch job has to relate to is January 1, 2021 as stated in the General Ledger Setup.  

**Negative Adjustment in step 3:** assigned Posting Date is January 1, provided by General Ledger Setup. The Posting Date of the Value Entry in the scope for adjustment is December 20, 2020. According to the General Ledger Setup, the date is not within the allowed posting date range. Therefore the Posting Date stated in the Allow Posting From field in the General Ledger Setup is assigned to the Adjustment Value Entry.  

**Negative Adjustment in step 4:** assigned Posting Date is January 15. The Value Entry in scope of adjustment has Posting Date January 15, which is within the allowed posting date range according to General Ledger Setup.  

The adjustment made for the Negative Adjustment in step 3 causes discussion. The favorable Posting Date for the Adjustment Value Entry would have been December 20 or at least within December as the revaluation causing the change in COGS was posted in December.  

To achieve adjustment in December of the Negative Adjustment in step 3, the General Ledger Setup, Allow Posting From field, needs to state a date in December.  

### Conclusion

With the experience gained in this scenario, when considering the most suitable setup for an allowed posting date range for a company, you might want to consider the following. As long as you allow changes in the inventory value to be posted in a period, such as December in this case, the setup that the company uses for allowed posting date ranges should be aligned with this decision. The Allow Posting From in the General Ledger Setup, stating December 1, would allow the revaluation made in December to be forwarded to affected outbound entries in the same period.  

User groups not allowed to post in December but in January, which was probably intended to be limited by the General Ledger Setup in this scenario, should instead be addressed via the User setup.  

## Item charge scenario  

### Prerequisites  

Please enter the following values:

**Inventory setup**:  

- Automatic Cost Posting = Yes  

- Automatic Cost Adjustment = Always  

- Average Cost Calc. Type = Item  

- Average Cost Period = Day  

**General Ledger Setup**:  

- Allow Posting From = December 1, 2020.  

- Allow Posting To = Empty  

**User Setup**:  

- Allow Posting From = December 1, 2020.  

- Allow Posting to = Empty  

### To test the scenario  

Test this scenario by carrying out the following steps:

1.  Create an **Item** Charge with the following values:  

     - Base unit of measure = PCS  

     - Costing Method = Average  

     - Select optional posting groups.  

2.  Create a new **Purchase Order** with the following values:  

     - Buy-from Vendor No.: 10000  

     - Posting Date = December 15, 2020

     - Vendor Invoice No.: 1234  

     On the Purchase Order Line select the following values:  

     - Item = CHARGE  

     - Quantity = 1  

     - Direct Unit Cost = 100  

     To complete the step, Post the document as Received and Invoiced.  

3.  Create a new **Sales Order** with the following values:  

     - Sell-to Customer No.: 10000  

     - Posting Date = December 16, 2020  

     On the Sales Order Line:  

     - Item = CHARGE  

     - Quantity = 1  

     - Unit Price = 135  

     To complete the step, Post the document as Received and Invoiced.  

4.  Enter values for the **General Ledger Setup** page:  

     - Allow Posting From = January 1, 2021  

    -  Allow Posting To = blank  

5.  Create a new **Purchase Order** with the following values:  

     - Buy-from Vendor No.: 10000  

     - Posting Date = January 2, 2021  

     - Vendor Invoice No.: 2345  

     On the Purchase Order Line:  

     - Item Charge = JB-FREIGHT  

     - Quantity = 1  

     - Direct Unit Cost = 3  

     - Assign the Item Charge to the Purchase Receipt from step 2.  

     To complete the step, Post the document as Received and Invoiced.

6.  On work date January 3, a purchase invoice arrives containing an additional item charge to the purchase made in step 2. This invoice has document date December 30, and is therefore posted with Posting Date December 30, 2020.  

     Create a new **Purchase Order** with the following values:  

     - Buy-from Vendor No.: 10000  

     - Posting Date = December 30, 2020  

     - Vendor Invoice No.: 3456  

     On the Purchase Order Line select the following values:  

     - Item Charge = JB-FREIGHT  

     - Quantity = 1  

     - Direct Unit Cost = 2  

     Assign Item Charge to the Purchase Receipt from step 2  

     To complete the step, Post the document as Received and Invoiced.

Inventory Valuation report is printed as of Date December 31, 2020

![Content of the Inventory Valuation report.](media/helene/TechArticleAdjustcost13.png "Content of the Inventory Valuation report")

**Summary of scenario:**  

The described scenario ends up with an Inventory Valuation report demonstrating Quantity = 0 while the Value = 2. The Item charge posted in step 6 is part of the Inventory Increase value of December while the Inventory Decrease of the same period is not affected.  

Having the General Ledger Setup stating Allow Posting From January 1 was a good thing for the first Item charge. The costs of the Inventory Increase and Decrease was recorded in the same period. For the second Item charge however, the General Ledger Setup causes the change in COGS to be recognized in the period after.  

**Conclusion:**  

It is a challenge to get the Inventory Valuation report to demonstrate Quantity = 0 while the Value <> 0. In this case it is also more difficult to express the optimal settings, having purchase invoices arriving the same day but addressing different periods or even fiscal years. Crossing to a new fiscal year usually requires some planning and as part of that the insight into Adjust Cost – Item entries process, recognizing COGS, is to be considered.  

In this scenario one option could have been to have the General Ledger Setup, field Allow Posting From, stating a date in December for a couple of more days and the posting of the first item charge postponed to allow all costs for the previous period/fiscal year to be recognized for the period they belong to first, having the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job run and thereafter move the allowed posting date to the new period\/fiscal year. The first item charge with posting date January 2 could then be posted.

# Consolidate financial data from multiple companies

Some organizations use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in multiple business units or legal entities. Others use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in subsidiaries that must report into parent organizations. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives accountants tools that help them transfer general ledger entries from two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company.  

Each company involved in a consolidation is called a business unit. The company in which you combine the data is called the consolidated company.  

You can transfer financial data from subsidiaries to the consolidated company, even if the subsidiaries use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in different environments. To learn more about how to connect to other environments, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md#busunit).

If the financial statements of a business unit use a different currency than the consolidated company, you must set up exchange rates for consolidation. To learn more about exchange rates for consolidations, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md#exchrates).  

You can consolidate:  

* Across companies that have different charts of accounts.  
* Companies that use different fiscal years and different currencies.  
* Either the full amount or a percentage of a company's financial information.
* Using different currency exchange rates in individual G/L accounts.
* Companies in other accounting and business management programs.
* Companies in different [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments.

You set up the consolidated company in the same way that you set up other companies. The chart of accounts is independent of the chart of accounts in the business units. The chart of accounts in the business units can differ from one another. To learn more about setting up a consolidation, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md).  

> [!TIP]
> Consolidating financial data can be especially relevant for intercompany processes. To learn more about intercompany features, go to [Managing Intercompany Transactions](intercompany-manage.md).

## Consolidate data

Before you consolidate, it's a good idea to test your data before you transfer it to the consolidated company. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] looks for differences in the information in the business units and the consolidated company. For example, whether account numbers or dimension codes are different. Correct any errors you find before you run the report. You can test the database or, if you're importing data from an XML file, the file.

### Test the data before you consolidate

1. Open the consolidated company.  
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Business Units**, and then choose the related link.  
3. Test the file and database, as follows:  

    * To test a file, choose the **Test File** action, enter the name of the file to test, and then choose **Print**.  
    * To test the database, choose **Test Database**.  

### Run the consolidation

After you've tested the data, you can transfer it to the consolidated company. An assisted setup guide will help you through the process.

> [!NOTE]
> When you run the consolidation you can choose the companies to include. If your consolidated company doesn't have access to one or more subsidiaries, the guide will let you grant access to them.

1. Sign in to the consolidated company.  
2. On the **Business Units** page, choose the **Consolidate** action.  
3. Fill in the required fields.  

## Use the Consolidated Trial Balance report

The **Consolidated Trial Balance** report can give you an overview of the overall financial health of your business. The report combines general ledger entries from each of your companies in a new company that you created for the consolidated data. The consolidated company is just a container for the consolidated data, and doesn't have any live business data. The companies that you include in the consolidated company become **Business Units** in the report. If you have four business units or fewer, you can also use the **Consolidated Trial Balance (4)** report.  

The report shows a line for each account, and follows the structure of the chart of accounts. An account isn't shown if all the amounts on the line are 0. The report shows the following information for each account:

* The account number and the name of the account.
* The totals for the consolidated company and for each business unit. Totals can display either as a net change or the balance to date.
* The eliminations made in the consolidated company. Eliminations always show for a period corresponding to the consolidated company's fiscal year.
* The total for the consolidated company after the eliminations show either as a net change or the balance to date.

## Eliminate repeated transactions

After you consolidate the companies, you must find and eliminate any transactions that are recorded more than once across companies. Processing consolidation eliminations is a manual process.  

To eliminate repeated transactions:

1. Find transactions that might need to be adjusted, and enter general journal lines to eliminate them.
2. Run the **G/L Consolidation Eliminations** report to help you assess the effect of the general journal lines before posting.
3. Post the adjusting transactions.

The **G/L Consolidation Eliminations** report displays a tentative trial balance where you can simulate the consequences of eliminating entries. The report compares the entries in the consolidated company with the eliminations entered in the general journal.

Before you can include a business unit in the report, you must set up the unit on the **Business Units** page. Make sure to turn on the **Consolidate** toggle.

A line is created for each account, following the structure of the chart of accounts. An account isn't shown if all amounts on the line are 0. The report shows the following information for each account:

* Account number.
* Account name.
* If you selected one or more business unit codes in the **Business Unit Code** field on the request page, a total shown for the consolidated company excludes the selected business units and eliminations. If you didn't fill in **Business Unit Code** field, the total for the consolidated company excludes eliminations.
* If you selected a business unit code in the **Business Unit Code** field on the request page, a total shows for the imported entries from the business unit. If you didn't fill in the **Business Unit Code** field, a total shows for the posted eliminations in the consolidated company.
* The total for the consolidated company with all the business units and all posted eliminations.
* The eliminations to make in the consolidated company. That is, the entries in the general journal that is selected on the request page.
* The posting text copied from the general journal.
* The consolidated company's total after the eliminations, if they're posted.

## Export and import consolidated data between databases

If data for a business unit is in another database, you can do a manual file-based transfer or automate the process by using an API. To learn more about the API, go to [Use our API to automatically share data across environments](#use-our-api-to-automatically-share-data-across-environments).

This section describes the manual, file-based process.

You export the data to a file before you include it in the consolidation. Export each company separately by using the **Export Consolidation** batch job.  

> [!TIP]
> Use the same process to export consolidated data that you must submit to Dynamics 365 Finance. For example, if the business unit is a subsidiary and the parent company uses Dynamics 365 Finance.

After you run the batch job, all entries in general ledger accounts are processed. For every combination of selected dimensions and date, the contents of the entries' **Amount** fields are totaled and exported. The next combination of the selected dimensions and date with the same account number is processed. Then the combinations in the next account number are processed, and so on.  

The exported entries contain the following fields: **Account No.**, **Posting Date**, and **Amount**. If dimensions information was also exported, dimension codes and dimension values are also included.  

1. For each exported line, if the total of the **Amount** fields is a debit, the account number that is set up in the business unit's **Consol. Debit Acc.** field is exported to the line. If the total is a credit, the corresponding number in the **Consol. Credit Acc.** field is exported to the line.  
2. The date used for each exported line is either the period's ending date or, if the transfer occurs each day, the exact date of the calculation.  
3. The dimension value exported for the entry will be the consolidated company dimension value that is specified in the **Consolidation Code** field for that dimension value. If a consolidated company dimension value hasn't been entered in the **Consolidated Code** field for the dimension value, the dimension value itself will be exported to the line.  
4. The XML files also contain the currency exchange rates in the consolidation period. These rates are included in a separate section at the beginning of the file.  

## Use our API to automatically share data across environments

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides an API that let's you automate the process of sharing financial data from business units to the consolidated company. The API is free to use and easy to set up. It even let's you share data across [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments. For example, you might need to share across environments when business units are not in the same Azure geographies. To learn more about using the API to automate the consolidation process, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md#busunit).

# Responsible AI FAQ for autofill (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Copilot’s Autofill feature in Business Central.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

<!--[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]-->

## What is Autofill?

Manually entering data can be time-consuming and error-prone, both for casual users of Business Central, and expert users that are tasked with entering records throughout their entire workday.  

Microsoft Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that sparks creativity, boosts productivity, and eliminates tedious tasks. Copilot uses AI to suggest and fill out field values automatically on your page, instead of typing or looking up things across screens. You can choose to keep or discard the suggestions. 

## What are the capabilities of Autofill?

When you ask Copilot to autofill fields on a page in Business Central, it suggests values for all fields within a field group (FastTab). These suggestions aren't always AI-generated. Copilot uses various mechanisms described in the following table to provide suggestions for each field, indicating the most appropriate mechanism.

Regardless of whether the suggested value is AI-generated, Copilot always uses AI to determine the appropriate mechanism for a field.

|Mechanism|Description|
|-|-|
|Most-Frequently Used |The value most frequently assigned to records in your company. The suggested value isn't computed using AI and comes directly from your Business Central data. |
|Most-Recently Used |For fields that reference another table, the most recently used reference, or most recently viewed record for that table. The suggested value isn't computed using AI and comes directly from your Business Central data. |
|Lookup selection |For fields that reference another table and have a short list of possible choices, AI is used to intelligently select from the possible values.|
|AI-generated |AI is used to intelligently generate the suggested value. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Copilot runs under your user context. It only has access to data that you already have access to. Your assigned permissions and all other security and compliance controls also apply when you use Copilot.

## What is the intended use of Autofill? 

Autofill is an assistive feature intended to help people enter data into Business Central. It isn't designed to run autonomously and enter data on behalf of others. Since the suggestions aren't automatically saved to Business Central, you must review and accept each field for it to be saved. 

When you choose to keep a suggestion, you're saving the change to Business Central similar to if you entered that value yourself without the assistance of Copilot.

When you leave the page or record, any suggestions that you didn't choose to keep are automatically discarded. 

Suggested values are displayed directly within the field editing experience, making it easy for you to review each suggestion and choose to keep, discard, or replace the suggestion. 

## How was Autofill evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance? 

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft in [Empowering responsible AI practices](https://aka.ms/RAI).

The feature underwent extensive AI testing using Business Central's demonstration data and other fictitious business data. Testing covered various fields and pages from Business Central. Copilot’s output was evaluated for accuracy of suggested values, selection of the appropriate mechanism to suggest a value, grounding of suggested values in database data, and other metrics.

To ensure customer safety and data protection, this feature underwent rigorous testing to detect and deflect harmful content, jailbreaks, and other risks.

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content? 

Microsoft has various automated systems in place to ensure that output from Copilot is of the highest quality. Automated systems also detect abuse, and ensure safety for our customers and their data by filtering harmful content. 

Microsoft might disable the Copilot features for selected customers if abuse of the functionality is detected. 

Users have the opportunity to provide feedback to every Copilot response and report inaccurate or inappropriate content to help Microsoft improve this feature. If you encounter inappropriate content, report it to Microsoft by using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249810). We analyze user feedback on the feature and use it to help us improve responses.

You provide feedback by using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icon in the information about an individual suggestion or for all suggestions in the group of fields.

## What are the AI limitations of Autofill? How can users minimize the impact of the limitations when using the system?

- General AI limitations

  AI systems are valuable tools but they're nondeterministic. The content they generate might not be accurate. It's important to use your judgment to review and verify responses before making decisions that could affect stakeholders like customers and partners. 

- Geographic and language availability

  [!INCLUDE [copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only.md)]

- Certain industry, product, and subject limitations

  Organizations that operate in some business domains, such as medical, drugs, legal, and weapons, might experience lower quality or limited output from Copilot due to the sensitive nature of that domain.

## What data does Autofill collect and how is it used?

Business Central collects the minimum data required for Microsoft to offer the service. 

- Microsoft collects anonymized information about decisions made by Copilot and your choice to keep or discard a suggestion. It doesn't collect suggested field values or other company data used by Copilot to provide suggestions.
- Microsoft doesn't use your business data to train the foundational models for the benefit of others. Learn more in [Dynamics 365 terms for Azure OpenAI-powered features](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2236010).

# Set Up Vendor Bank Accounts

Just as you can use bank account information on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to keep track of your company's banking transactions, you can also set banking details for vendors. Vendor bank account data can simplify payments to suppliers when combined with the [AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals Extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md) or the [Export Payments to a Bank File](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md) feature, for example.

## Add or edit a vendor bank account

[!INCLUDE [purchase-vendor-bank-account](includes/purchase-vendor-bank-account.md)]

> [!TIP]
> You can set additional vendor bank accounts on the **Vendor Bank Account List** page.

## Set up a preferred vendor bank account

If a vendor has one or more bank accounts and you want to set a preferred option for the payment journal lines, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the vendor.
3. On the **Payments** FastTab, choose the default vendor bank account in the **Preferred Bank Account Code** field.

# Work with inventory periods

Inventory periods define a period of time in which you can post changes to inventory. An inventory period is defined by the date on which it ends, or the ending date. When you close an inventory period, you can't post any changes to inventory, either expected or invoiced, before this ending date. You can't post any new values to inventory before the ending date. If you have open item entries in the closed period, meaning positive quantities that haven't yet been applied to outbound transactions, you can still apply outbound quantities to these entries, even if the period is closed.  

The following sections describe how to:

* Create inventory periods.  
* Close inventory periods.  
* Reopen inventory periods.  

## To create an inventory period

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new line.  
3. In the **Ending Date** field, enter the last date in the inventory period that you want to define. When the period is closed, you won't be able to post inventory changes before this date.  
4. Enter a descriptive name in the **Name** field. Choose the **OK** button.  

## To close inventory periods

The **Closed** field indicates whether or not the inventory period is closed to inventory value changes. You can't edit this field.  

You can close any inventory period, if the following is true:  

* There are no open outbound item ledger entries, meaning negative inventory, in that period.  
* The cost of all items has been adjusted using the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job.  

This means that all outbound transaction quantities, such as those from sales orders, outbound transfers, sales invoices, purchase returns, or purchase credit memos, must be applied to existing quantity in inventory.  

### To close an inventory period  

1. Before closing an inventory period, choose the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** action to ensure that all cost adjustments are posted.

    Run the **Close Inventory Period – Test** report to determine if there are any open outbound item entries within the inventory period or any items whose cost hasn't yet been adjusted.  
2. Choose the **Test Report** action.  

    Run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job to ensure that all costs are posted to the general ledger.  
3. Choose the **Post Inventory to G/L** action.  
4. On the **Inventory Periods** page, select the inventory period you want to close.  
5. Choose the **Close Period** action. After the inventory period has been closed, you can't post inventory changes before the ending date. The cost of all items must be adjusted with the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job before you close the inventory period.  
6. Choose the **Yes** button to confirm that you want to close the period, or choose **No** to cancel the closing.  
7. The inventory period is closed and a confirmation message is displayed when it's finished.  

## Reopening inventory periods  
After you have closed the inventory period, you can't delete the inventory period. You can, however, reopen it, if you would like to allow posting before the ending date of the inventory period. Reopening a period also reopens all inventory periods with ending dates later than the period you reopen.  

### To reopen an inventory period  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the inventory period you want to reopen.  
3. Choose the **Reopen Period** period action. Confirm that you want to reopen the period.  
4. All inventory periods with ending dates later than the period you selected are reopened.

# Purchases Decomposition (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Purchases Decomposition** report provides a comprehensive breakdown of your total purchase amount by item categories, vendors, fiscal periods, and document types. This report helps you gain insights into purchasing costs and analyze spending patterns, so you make data-driven decisions to optimize purchasing processes.  

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-decomposition.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases Decomposition Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-decomposition.png":::

## Use the report

The helps purchasing teams break down costs and optimize purchasing activities.

Purchasing managers can use the report to analyze purchasing processes and optimize inventory management. You can break down purchases by supplier, category, and other relevant dimensions. You can analyze the purchase amounts over time to identify trends and improve your supply chain, leading to cost savings.

Purchasers can use this report to analyze the purchasing activities for a specific category of item. You can use the visual to:

- Analyze the cost breakdown of vendors within the category and identify opportunities to reduce costs.
- Drill down into the data and identify which suppliers provide the most cost-effective items.
- Analyze the volume of purchases over time.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Purchases Decomposition* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

# Set up Intrastat reporting

All companies in the European Union (EU) must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. Companies must report the movement of goods to the statistics authorities in their country/region every month, and the report must be delivered to the tax authorities. Intrastat is the system that's used to collect trade statistics about goods within these countries/regions. Use the Intrastat report to complete periodic Intrastat reporting by collecting, recording, and reporting the trade of goods according to local legislation.

Intrastat reporting is based on basic EU regulations that apply to all countries/regions. However, there are differences within the individual countries/regions. Each country/region has its rules about what and how to report.

> [!NOTE]  
> Intrastat information doesn't apply to the movement of services between countries/regions, but only goods (Items and Fixed Assets). If the local government requires registering the movement of services between countries/regions, it can be done using the **Service Declaration** feature.
>
> This features is available as an app at [AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). ATo use this feature, you must first install it on the **Extension Management** page. Learn more about this functionality [here](finance-how-setup-use-service-declaration.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This article describes the new Intrastat experience available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] starting in the 2022 release wave 2, which includes extended features. If you haven't upgraded your solution, read the previous version's Intrastat setup and usage article at [Set Up and Report Intrastat](finance-how-setup-report-intrastat-v20.md).

## Assisted setup

To use assisted setup for the Intrastat, follow these steps:  

1. Select the :::image type="icon" source="media/ui-search/search_small.png" border="false"::: icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then select the related link. 
2. On the **Assisted Setup** page, select the line for **Set up Intrastat reporting** in the **Report on financial health** group.  
3. Follow the instructions for the basic setup for Intrastat. To read more about the Intrastat setup, see the [Intrastat configuration](#intrastat-configuration) section later in this article.
4. After the setup is completed, select **Finish** to start to use the new Intrastat experience.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can install the Intrastat Reporting Core app on any base app country version, regardless of whether it's in the EU. However, this feature is intended for regulatory reporting in EU countries. Microsoft provides full regulatory and localization support only in EU countries. If you're in an EU country where Microsoft doesn't provide localization support, you must find partner-based localization support. You might have to install a country/region-specific Intrastat app in addition to the core extension to meet local requirements. The country-specific apps can only be installed on base apps because they're intended for localization purposes. Intrastat Core has one core app and country-specific local apps.  

## Intrastat configuration

Before you can use Intrastat reports, there are several configurations that must be set up.  

### Intrastat reporting setup

Use the **Intrastat Reporting Setup** page to enable and set the default behavior for Intrastat reporting. You can specify whether you need to report Intrastat from shipments (dispatches), receipts (arrivals), or both, depending on thresholds set by your local authorities. You can also set default transaction types for the regular and return documents that are used for transaction reporting.

Follow the steps to set up Intrastat reporting.

The value specifies the rule that transforms imported text to a supported value before it can be mapped to a specified field in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you choose a value in this field, the exact value is entered in the **Transformation Rule** field in the **Data Exch. Field Mapping Buf.** table. (Conversely, when an exact value is entered in the **Transformation Rule** field in the **Data Exch. Field Mapping Buf.** table, a value is chosen in this field.)

9. If you need to group entries based on some columns, on the **Field Grouping** FastTab, select the fields that you want to use for grouping.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] comes with the preconfigured data exchange definition for Intrastat for all localized countries/regions. To learn more about how to create a new data exchange definition, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

### Set mandatory fields with the Intrastat report checklist

In some countries/regions, the authorities require that Intrastat reports include, for example, the shipment method for purchases or other values when sales are over a certain threshold.

To set mandatory fields or values on the **Intrastat Report** page, follow the steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Select **Intrastat Report Checklist**.
3. Follow the steps to add the necessary lines for checking:
   1. Set the **Field No.** field to a field that must be checked for a nonempty value.
   2. Enter a value in the **Filter Expression** field if needed, based on the following rules:

        1. When you open the **Filter Page**, select the filter that you need to use for checking.
        2. Select a value related to the selected filter.
        3. If you must fill more filters for the chosen field, repeat the previous two steps to add another filter.
        4. When you finish entering the filters for the chosen field, select **OK**.

   3. Select the **Reversed Filter Expression** checkbox to specify that the check for fields is run only on those lines that don't match the filter expression. If the line isn't filtered, this field is ignored.

> [!NOTE]
> When you open the **Filter Page** from the **Filter Expression** line, you can use all standard filter expressions related to the specific field you want to filter.
>
> Be careful when you set up validation rules, because they can differ between countries/regions.

## Use custom codeunits in Intrastat reporting

If you want to change how Intrastat works, and the default configuration isn't enough, you can customize the system by extending the standard features. If you need to further change the Intrastat behavior, you can develop your own codeunits. When you create codeunits, you need to make extra changes to use them. To configure [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to use your own objects, follow these steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Reports Configuration**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **VAT Reports Configuration** page, add a new line.
3. In the **VAT Report Type** field, select **Intrastat Report**.
4. In the **VAT Report Version** field, specify the version of the report.
5. Add your codeunits for the following options:
   1. In the **Suggest Lines Codeunit ID** field, specify the new codeunit for suggesting lines in the Intrastat report lines.
   2. In the **Content Codeunit ID** field, specify the new codeunit for exporting data as a file using a Data Exchange Definition.
   3. In the **Validate Codeunit ID** field, specify the new codeunits for validating results inside Intrastat report lines.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This line must be empty if you use the standard codeunits. You should only create a line and configure it if you have developed custom codeunits.

## Other Intrastat configurations

Customer and vendor cards include the **Intrastat Partner Type** field, which has the same option values as the **Partner Type** field: 

- (blank)
- Company
- Person

The **Intrastat Partner Type** field replaced the **Partner Type** field in Intrastat reporting. The **Partner Type** field is used in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) to define the SEPA Direct Debit Scheme (Core or B2B). The **Intrastat Partner Type** field is used for Intrastat reporting only. Therefore, you can specify different values for the two fields if necessary.

If the **Intrastat Partner Type** field is left blank, the value from the **Partner Type** field is used for Intrastat reporting.

In addition to **Intrastat Report Setup**, **Data Exchange Definitions**, and **Intrastat Report Checklist**, the following settings must also be configured.

| Page | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Countries/Regions** | On the **Countries/Regions** page, add **EU Country/Region Code** and **Intrastat Code** information to specify a code for the country/region that you're trading with. This information is used in Intrastat reporting. |
| **Tariff Numbers** | In many countries/regions, the customs and tax authorities establish eight-digit codes for various items. To enable item entries to contain the necessary information when the program imports them to the Intrastat journal line, enter the item code on the **Tariff Numbers** page. Find the codes for the items that your company deals with, and enter them on the **Tariff Numbers** page. |
| **Transport Methods** | There are seven, one-digit codes for Intrastat transport methods: **1** for sea, **2** for rail, **3** for road, **4** for air, **5** for the post, **7** for fixed installations, and **9** for own propulsion (for example, transporting a car by driving it). [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't require these specific codes. However, we recommend that the descriptions provide a similar meaning. |
| **Transaction Types** | Countries and regions have different codes for types of Intrastat transactions. For example, for ordinary purchases and sales, exchange of returned goods, and exchange of non-returned goods. Set up all the codes that apply to your country/region. These codes are then used on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab on sales and purchase documents and when you process returns. |
| **Transaction Specifications** | Set up codes to supplement the transaction type descriptions. |
  
> [!NOTE]
> Starting in January 2022, Intrastat requires different transaction nature codes for dispatches to private individuals or non-VAT registered businesses and VAT-registered businesses. To comply with this requirement, we recommend that you review or add new transaction nature codes on the **Transaction Types** page, according to the requirements in your country. You should also check and update the **Intrastat Partner Type** field to *Person* for a private individual or non-VAT registered business customers on the relevant **Customer** page. If you're unsure about the correct Intrastat partner type or transaction type to use, we recommend that you ask an expert in your country or region.

|   Field   |   Description   |
| --------- | --------------- |
| **Net Weight** | Weight is one of the basic configurations  that are related to Intrastat reporting, because the total weight is mandatory for reporting. To be ready for this requirement, enter a value in the **Net Weight** field on the item or fixed asset card. |
| **Country of Origin Code** | Use the two-letter ISO Alpha Codes on the item or fixed asset card for the country/region where the good was obtained or produced. If the good was produced in more than one country/region, the country/region of origin is the last country/region where it was processed. |
| **VAT identification number of the partner operator in the Member State of import** | This number is the VAT-ID of the partner operator in the member state of import. The VAT-ID is also used in the exchange of intra-EU-export data among the member states and allows the member states to allocate the received data to the importing company in their own country/region. Reporting units must report on the VAT-ID of the company that declared the intra-Union acquisition of goods in the member state of import. |

Optionally, you can also set up:

- **Commodity codes**: Customs and tax authorities have numerical codes that classify items and services. You can specify these codes on items.
- **Areas**: Supplementary information about countries and regions.
- **Entry/exit points**: Specify the locations where you ship or receive items to or from other countries/regions. An airport is an example of an entry or exit point. You enter entry or exit points on sales and purchase documents on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab. This information is copied from the item entries when you create the Intrastat journal.
- **Supplementary unit of measure**: The quantity of goods for Intrastat reporting can be either net weight (in kilograms) or a supplementary unit. If supplementary units are required, you must configure them for items and fixed assets.

The sections that follow describe how to set up the transfer.

### Intrastat report

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report Setup**, and then select the related link. 
2. In the **Intrastat Report Setup** in the **Default Country Code for Item Tracking** field, choose the **Purchase Headers** option.  

### Item  

You must enable item tracking for these items, either serial numbers, lots, or both. To enable item tracking for the item, follow these steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item**, and then select the related link.
2. Choose the item that you want to configure.
3. On the **Item Card** page, on the **Item Tracking** FastTab, select one of item tracking codes using the **Item Tracking Code** field.
4. When you make a selection, you can see how the item tracking codes are configured.
5. Select the code you want, and select **OK**.

### Use the item in purchase documents

After you select an item that has item tracking enabled on the purchase line, follow these steps.  

1. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Line**, and run the **Item Tracking Lines** action.
2. On the **Item Tracking Lines** page after adding **Serial No.** or **Lot No.**, and entering value in **Quantity (Base)** field, choose one of the following options:  
   1. The **Lot No. Information Card** action if you're using lots.   
   2. The **Serial No. Information Card** action if you're using serial numbers.  
3. You can choose **New** (**+**) to create new lot or serial numbers on the **Lot No. Information Card** or **Serial No. Information Card** pages. 
4. The **Country/Region Code** is populated with the **Country/Region Code** from the purchase document. You can change it if you want.
5. Close the page.
6. Repeat this process for each line on the **Item Tracking Lines** page where you configured item tracking.
7. Close the **Item Tracking Lines** page.

When you work with sales invoices, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically collects the **Country/Region Code** for any lot or serial number you choose. You can always check the code using the **Item Tracking Lines** action from the sales lines.  

These **Country/Region Codes** are automatically populated in the **Country/Region of Origin Code** field in the **Intrastat Report Lines**.  

## Enter country/region Intrastat settings

Intrastat requirements are similar in all member states of the EU, though there are important exceptions. In theory, the rules should be uniformly applied in all member states. However, there are differences in implementations, because some member states provide guidelines about how to apply the principles in specific situations (for example, commercial samples and returns of goods). These guidelines can produce different results for various situations. Therefore, the information that countries/regions must enter can differ, as can the file format that they must use for reporting.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't fill in the **Lot No. Information Card** or **Serial No. Information Card** pages for a lot or serial number, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] won't use the **Country/Region Code** from the purchase document. Instead, the information comes from the **Item** card.  

### Austria

Intrastat reporting in Austria requires two different files for receipts and shipments. To verify that your setup is correct, follow the steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report Setup**, and then select the related link.  
2. On the **Reporting** FastTab, check whether **Split Receipts/Shipments Files** is selected. If it is, two separate **Data Exch. Def. Code** values are configured.
3. Verify that the **Zip File(-s)** field is selected, to ensure that report files are added to the zip file.

The process of working with Intrastat reports is the same as the global feature.

<!-- ### Belgium-->

### Czech Republic

The new Intrastat report experience for the Czech Republic is available in 2023 release wave 1. In the meantime, continue to use the **Intrastat Journal** feature.

# Setup best practices: Reordering policies

The **Reordering Policy** field on item cards has planning methods that determine how the individual planning parameters interact.  

One best-practice foundation for selecting a reordering policy is the item’s ABC classification. When you use ABC classification, you manage items according to three classes. The class you use depends on the item's value and volume relative to the total stock. The following table shows the value-volume distribution of the three classes.

|Class|Percent of total stock volume|Percent of total stock value|
|-----|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
|A|10-20|50-70|
|B|20|20|
|C|60-70|10-30|

The ABC classification states that effort and money can be saved by applying looser control to items of low value-volume than to items of high value-volume. The following illustration shows which reordering policy in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is best suited for A, B, and C items respectively.

![ABC Classification.](media/abc_classification.png "abc_classification")

The following table provides best practices for selecting between the four policies.  

|Setup option|Best practice|Comment|  
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|  
|**Order**|Use for A items.<br /><br /> Use for make-to-order items.<br /><br /> In manufacturing, use for top-level items and for expensive components and subassemblies.<br /><br /> Use for items that are purchased as drop shipments and special orders.<br /><br /> Don't use if you don't accept automatic reservation.|A items, such as leather couches in a furniture store, are high-value items with low and irregular order velocity where inventory is unacceptable, or the required attributes vary. The best reordering policy is therefore one that plans specifically for each demand.|  
|**Lot-for-Lot**|Use for B items.<br /><br /> In manufacturing, use for components that occur in multiple BOMs. This policy ensures that purchase orders are combined for the same vendor, so better prices can be negotiated.<br /><br /> Use if you aren't sure about which reordering policy to select.|B items, such as dining chairs, have a regular and fairly high order velocity, but also high carrying costs. The best reordering policy for B items is therefore one that is economical by bundling demand in the reorder cycle.<br /><br /> 80 percent of items can use this policy.<br /><br /> Can be used successfully without planning parameters.|  
|**Fixed Reorder Qty.**|Use for C items.<br /><br /> Combine with reorder-point parameters.<br /><br /> In manufacturing, use for lowest-level components.<br /><br /> Don't use if the item is often reserved.|C items, such as tea cups, are low-value items with high and regular order velocity. The best reordering policy for C items is therefore one that guarantees constant availability by always staying above a reorder point.<br /><br /> If the user reserves a quantity for a distant demand, the planning foundation is disturbed. Even if the projected inventory level is acceptable regarding the reorder point, the quantities might not be available because of the reservation.|  
|**Maximum Qty.**|Use for C items with high carrying costs or storing limitations.<br /><br /> Combine with one or more order modifiers (Minimum/Maximum Order Quantity or Order Multiple).|C items, such as tea cups, are low-value items with high and regular order velocity. The best reordering policy for C items is therefore one that guarantees constant availability by always staying above a reorder point, but below a maximum inventory quantity.<br /><br /> To modify the suggested order, you might want the order quantity to be decreased to a specified maximum order quantity, increased to a specified minimum order quantity, or rounded up to meet a specified order multiple. **Note:**  If used with a reorder point, then inventory stays between the reorder point and the maximum quantity.|

# Viewing Database Locks

Database locking controls access by multiple users to the same data at the same time. To protect a transaction against other transactions modifying the same data, the first transaction puts a lock on the data. The lock remains until the transaction's done.

Users may be blocked from completing transactions on the locked data. They'll typically get a message that indicates the lock condition.

## To view database locks

Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Database Locks**, and then choose the related link.

The **Database Locks** page gives snapshot of all current database locks.

For more information about database locking, see [Monitoring Database Locks](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/monitor-database-locks) in the Business Central Developer and IT Pro help.

# Sell products with a customer sales order

This article provides guidance on when you should use a customer sales order in addition to an invoice. If your sales process requires you to only ship part of an order, perhaps because the full quantity isn't available right away, you must process that sale by making a sales order.

You must also use sales orders if you sell items that deliver directly from your vendor to your customer, in what is called a drop shipment. To learn more, go to [Make Drop Shipments](sales-how-drop-shipment.md). In all other respects, sales orders work the same way as sales invoices. To learn more, go to [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).

When you deliver the products, either fully or partially, you post the sales order as shipped or as shipped and invoiced to create the related item and customer ledger entries in your system. When you post the sales order, you can also email it as a PDF attachment. You can prefill the email body with a summary of the order and payment information, such as a link to PayPal. To learn more, go to [Ship Items](warehouse-how-ship-items.md) and [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md).

In business environments where the customer pays immediately, such as via PayPal or cash, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records the payment when you post the sales invoice. The posted sales invoice is closed as fully applied. You select the method in the **Payment Method Code** field on the sales order. For electronic payments, such as PayPal, you must also fill in the **Payment Service** field. To learn more, go to [Enable Customer Payments Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

You can even create directly paid orders for unregistered customers by first setting up a "cash customer" card, which you point to on the sales order. To learn more, go to [Set Up Cash Customers](finance-how-to-set-up-cash-customers.md).

## Create a sales order

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedure assumes that the customer is already set up. To learn more about setting up customers, go to [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, then choose the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a new entry.
3. In the **Customer Name** field, enter the name of an existing customer.

    Other fields on the **Sales Order** page are now filled in with information about the selected customer.  

4. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Order** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you allow the customer to pay immediately, for example, by credit card or PayPal, then fill in the **Payment Method Code** field. The payment is then recorded as soon as you post the sales order as invoiced. If you select *cash*, then the payment is recorded in a specified balancing account.

    You're now ready to fill in the sales order lines with inventory items or services you want the customer to purchase.

    If you set up recurring sales lines for the customer, such as a monthly replenishment order, you can insert these lines on the order by choosing the **Get Recurring Sales Lines** action.
5. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select what type of product, charge, transaction, or comment you post to the customer on the sales line.

6. In the **No.** field, enter the number of an inventory item or service.

    Leave the **No.** field empty if the line is for a:

    * Comment. Write the comment in the **Description** field.
    * Catalog item. Choose the **Select Catalog Items** action. To learn more about catalog items, go to To learn more, go to [Work With Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).
7. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to be sold.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > For items of the *Resource* or *Service* type, the quantity is a time unit, such as hours, as indicated in the **Unit of Measure Code** field on the line. To learn more, go to [Set Up Item Units of Measure](inventory-how-setup-units-of-measure.md).

    The **Line Amount** field is updated to show the value in the **Unit Price** field multiplied by the number in the **Quantity** field.

    The price and line amounts are shown with or without sales tax depending on what you selected in the **Prices Including Tax** field on the customer card.
8. In the **Line Discount %** field, enter a percentage if you want to grant the customer a discount on the product. The value in the **Line Amount** field is updated accordingly.

    If you set up special item prices on the **Sales Prices and Sales Line Discounts** FastTab on the **Customer Card** or **Item Card** pages, the price and amount values on the sales lines update automatically if the criteria are met. To learn more about prices and discounts, go to [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).
9. To add a comment about the order line, that the customer can read on the printed sales order, write a comment on an empty line in the **Description** field.  
10. Repeat steps 5 through 9 for every item you want to the customer to purchase.

    The totals fields under the lines are automatically updated as you create or modify lines to display the amounts to be posted to the ledgers.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In rare cases, the posted amounts might differ from what is displayed in the totals fields. The difference is typically due to rounding calculations in relation to value-added tax (VAT) or sales tax.
    >
    > To double-check the amounts, use the **Statistics** page, which takes into account the rounding calculations. Also, if you choose the **Release** action, the totals fields update to include rounding calculations.  

11. Optionally, in the **Inv. Discount Amount** field, enter the amount to be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field.

    If you set up invoice discounts for the customer, the **Invoice Discount %** field automatically updates if the discount criteria are met. The **Inv. Discount Amount Excl. Tax** field shows related amount. To learn more, go to [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).
12. To ship only part of the order quantity, enter that quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field. The value automatically copies to the **Qty. to Invoice** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the **Shipping Advice** field is set as **Complete** in the **Shipping and Billing** FastTab, you can't post partial shipments. Learn more at [Process Partial Shipments](sales-how-send-partial-shipments.md).
13. To invoice only part of the shipped quantity, enter that quantity in the **Qty. to Invoice** field. The quantity must be lower than the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field.  
14. When the sales order lines are completed, choose the **Post and Send** action.

[!INCLUDE [order-ship-invoice](includes/order-ship-invoice.md)]

The **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box displays the customer's preferred method of receiving documents. You can change the sending method by choosing the lookup button for the **Send Document to** field. To learn more, go to [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).

The related item and customer ledger entries are now created, and the sales order is output as a PDF document. When the sales order is fully posted, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] removes it from the list of sales orders.  

## Create a new sales order based on a copy of another order

> [!TIP]
> This section describes how to copy a sales order, but the steps are the same for other sales documents.

When you're creating a sales order that's similar to a previous one, you can save time by copying the order you already have. For example, you can copy the data in the order's header, its lines, or both, to your new order. Afterward, you can update the information on the new order, if needed.

The value of some fields on an order's lines depend on what you enter in the header. For example, the values in the amount fields depend on the discounts you set up for the customer. If you don't include the header when you copy the order, you must recalculate the lines so that their values are appropriate to the header's values. The **Recalculate Lines** toggle turns on automatically if you turn off the **Include Header** toggle.

> [!NOTE]
> If the **Calc. Inv. Discount** option is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, the invoice discount recalculates when you post the new document line. The new calculation might cause the amount on the new line to differ from the original.

> [!NOTE]
> If part of the quantity on the original lines was returned, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates the new line with only the quantity that wasn't returned. If the full quantity was returned, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't create a new line.

### How to copy a sales order

The following steps describe how to copy a sales order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose **New** to create a new document, and then choose the **Copy Document** action.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When you copy an order, you can choose to copy only the information in the order's lines, and not copy the order header. Skipping the header might be useful, for example, when you're selling the same items and quantities to a different customer. If you skip the header, fill in the **Customer Name** field on your new order before you use the **Copy Document** action.

1. In the **Document Type** field, choose **Order**.
1. In the **Document No.** field, choose the order to copy.

   [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fills in the **Doc. NO. Occurrence**, **Version No.**, **Sell-to Customer No.**, and **Sell-to Customer Name** fields based on the order you choose.
1. To copy information in the order's header, such as the customer name and the order's due date, turn on the **Include Header** toggle.

   If you choose this option, you also copy the lines. However, you must recalculate the amounts on the lines in the new order.
1. To copy and recalculate the lines from the original order to the new, turn on the **Recalculate Lines** toggle.

   The action keeps the item numbers and item quantities, but recalculates the amounts based on the item prices and discounts for the customer on the new order.

1. Choose **OK** to create the copy.

## External document number

[!INCLUDE [ext-doc-no-sales](includes/ext-doc-no-sales.md)]

## Working with amount fields

The values in fields that show amounts can be positive or negative, depending on whether the value represents a credit or a debit. This video shows how to work with fields that show amounts.

# Map text on recurring payments to accounts for automatic reconciliation

On the **Text-to-Account Mapping** page, which you open from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, you can set up mappings between text on payments and specific debit, credit, and balancing accounts so that such payments are posted to the specified accounts when you post the payment reconciliation journal.

Similar functionality exists to reconcile excess amounts on payment reconciliation journal lines on an ad-hoc basis. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments that Can't be Applied Automatically](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-cannot-apply-auto.md).

Payments posted based on text-to-account mapping are not applied to open entries, but are merely posted to the specified accounts in addition to creating bank account ledger entries. Accordingly, text-to-account mapping is suited for recurring cash receipts or expenses, such as frequent purchases of car fuel or bank fees and interest, that regularly occur on the bank statement and don't need a related business document. For more information, see the "Example - Text-to-Account Mapping for Fuel Expense" section in this article.

> [!NOTE]  
>   Payments on reconciliation journal lines are only set to posting according to text-to-account mapping if the automatic application function can only provide a match confidence of **Low** or **Medium**. If the automatic application function provides a match confidence of High, then the payment is automatically applied to one or more open entries, and the payment is not posted to the accounts specified on the **Text-to-Account Mapping** page. In other words, a match confidence of **High** overrules a text-to-account mapping.

On a payment reconciliation journal line where the payment has been set to posting according to text-to-account mapping, the **Match Confidence** field contains **High - Text-to-Account Mapping**, and the **Account Type** and **Account No.** fields contain the mapped accounts.

## To map text on recurring payments to accounts for automatic reconciliation

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Reconciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a payment reconciliation journal. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).
3. Choose the **Map Text to Account** action. The **Text-to-Account Mapping** page opens.
4. In the **Mapping Text** field, enter any text that occurs on payments that you want to post to specified accounts without applying to an open entry. You can enter up to 50 characters.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   If no other payments exist with the mapping text in question, then the text-to-account mapping will occur even when only a part of the text on the payment exists as a mapping text.
5. In the **Vendor No.** field, enter the vendor that the payments will be posted to.
6. In the **Bal. Source Type** field, specify if the payment will be posted to a general ledger account or to a customer or vendor account.
7. In the **Bal. Source No.** field, specify the account that the payment will be posted to, depending on your selection in the **Bal. Source Type** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Do not use the **Debit Acc. No.** and **Credit Acc. No.** fields in connection with payment reconciliation. They are used for incoming documents only. For more information, see [Use OCR to Turn PDF and Image Files into Electronic Documents](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md).

8. Repeat steps 3 through 7 for all text on payments that you want to map to accounts for direct posting without application.

Next time you import a bank statement file or choose the **Apply Automatically** action on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, journal lines for the payments that contain the specified mapping text will contain the mapped accounts in the **Account Type** and **Account No.** fields. The **Match Confidence** field will contain **High - Text-to-Account Mapping**. This is on the condition that the automatic application function can only provide a match confidence of **Low** or **Medium**.

## Example: Text-to-Account mapping for bank fees

To always post expenses that are related to fees from a specific bank, MyBank, to the general ledger account for bank charges and fees (account 60400), fill a line on the **Text-to-Account Mapping** page as follows.

| Mapping Text | Debit Acc. No. | Credit Acc. No. | Bal. Source Type | Bal. Source No. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MyBank |BLANK |60400|G/L Account |BLANK |

# Changing Company and Other Settings in Teams

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams includes a **Settings** page that lets you view and change information about your connection to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, you switch the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment and company you're connected to. You can also see which account you're using to access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and sign out and in again as needed.

There are two ways to open the **Settings** page: 1) from the message compose box or 2) from the command box.

1. Next to the message compose box, select **+**, right-click the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app icon, then select **Settings**.

    ![Settings for Business Central from command box.](media/teams-settings-message-box-2.png)

2. From the command box at the top, search for **/Business Central** and then select the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app icon. Then, in the message that appears the under the **[search for business contacts]** box, select **... (More options)** and then **Settings**. If the message isn't displayed, click the **[search for business contacts]** box.

# Audit changes to financial reporting

Financial reporting helps you gather insights into the financial data in your chart of accounts (COA). This article explains ways to monitor changes to your financial report definitions, and how to control access to financial reports.

## Set up the Change Log for financial report definitions

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to the definitions for financial reports. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)] 

The following table lists the table for financial report definitions and their IDs.

| Table | Table ID |
|------ | -------- |
| Report Definition       | 88  |
| Row Definition          | 84  |
| Column Definition       | 333 |

[!INCLUDE [include-audit-changes-to-setup-learn-more-link](includes/include-audit-changes-to-setup-learn-more-link.md)]

## Get notified when financial report definitions change

To add an extra layer of security around your financial report definitions, you can monitor changes to their fields and get an email when someone changes a value. 

To learn more, go to [Get notified when system setup change](across-setup-auditing.md#get-notified-when-system-setup-change)

## Analyze changes to financial report definitions

You can use the Data Analysis feature to answer questions such as:

- Which definition changed?
- Who changed it, and when?

To learn more, go to [Analyze changes to your setup](across-setup-auditing.md#analyze-changes-to-your-setup).

## Permissions to view or edit financial reports

The following table lists the permission sets that control whether you can view or edit financial reports and their report definitions.

| Access   | Permission set |
|------------------------| ---------------------- |
| View financial reports. | **Account Schedules - View** |
| Edit financial report definitions, including row and column definitions. | **Account Schedules - Edit** |

# Cross-Dock Items

Cross-dock items are items you receive and ship without putting them away. The put-away and pick processes require limited handling of items. You can cross-dock items for shipments and for production orders.

## Cross-dock bins and zones

If you're using bins, set up at least one cross-dock bin, and then specify the bin in the **Cross-Dock Bin Code** field on your locations. If you're using directed put-away and picks, set up a cross-dock zone.

When you prepare a shipment or pick items for production and you're using bins, the item is automatically picked from a cross-dock bin before any other bin. You must look in the cross-dock area to see whether the items you need are available there before you get the items in their usual storage area.  

If you've calculated cross-dock quantities, put-away lines to the cross-dock bin for cross-dock calculations are created when you post the receipt. Other put-away lines are created as usual.  

## Cross-dock select lines for a receipt

If you want to post the cross-dock items right away to make them available for picking, you must also register a put-away for the other items originating from the receipt line, namely those that need to be stored. If only some items on a receipt line are being cross-docked, you must therefore make an effort to put away the remaining items as quickly as possible. Alternatively, your warehouse policy could be to encourage cross-docking of entire receipt lines whenever possible.

In the put-away instruction, delete the Take and Place instruction lines for each receipt line for the items to put away. You can recreate the instruction lines later as put-away lines from the put-away worksheet or the posted receipt. After you delete the instruction lines you can put away and register the lines for cross-dock items.  

## About the Put-away Worksheet page

If you turn on the **Use Put-away Worksheet** toggle on the **Location Card** page, and post your receipt with calculated cross-docks, all receipt lines become available in the worksheet. The cross-dock information is lost and can't be recreated. Therefore, to use cross-dock functionality, you should relay lines to the put-away worksheet by deleting put-away instructions rather than using the automatic relay function provided in the **Use Put-away Worksheet** field.  

If you post the warehouse receipt and the **Use Put-away Worksheet** toggle is turned off, the cross-dock items become separate lines on the put-away instructions. The **Cross-Dock Information** field on each put-away line shows whether the line contains the following:

* Cross-dock items.
* All of the items from a receipt must be stored.
* Some items from a receipt must be stored, and some are to be cross-docked.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't keep separate records for cross-docked items. It registers them as ordinary put-away instructions.  

## To set up the warehouse for cross-docking  

1. If you're using bins, set up at least one cross-dock bin. If you're using directed put-away and picks, set up a cross-dock zone.  

    A cross-dock bin has the **Cross-Dock Bin** field selected. To learn more about bins, go to [Create Bins](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md).  

    If you are using zones, create a zone for your cross-dock bins, and select the **Cross-Dock Bin Zone** field. If you are using directed put-away and picks, select bin type with **Pick** selected, for example you can use *PICK* or *PUTPICK*. To learn more about zones and bin types, go to [Set Up Locations to Use Bins](warehouse-how-to-set-up-locations-to-use-bins.md) and [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).  

2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Location**, and then choose the related link.  
3. On the **Location** page, select the location that you want to set up the warehouse for cross-docking, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
4. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, turn on the **Use Cross-Docking** toggle and fill in the **Cross-Dock Due Date Calc.** field with the time to search for cross-dock opportunities.

    The **Use Cross-Docking** option is only available if the **Require Receipt**, **Require Shipment**, **Require Pick**, and **Require Put-away** fields are selected.  

5. If you're using bins, on the **Bins** FastTab, fill in the **Cross-Dock Bin Code** field with the code of the bin you would like to use as the default cross-dock bin.  
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Stockkeeping Unit**, and select the related link.  
7. For each item or stockkeeping unit that you want to be able to cross-dock, select the item, and then choose the **Edit** action.
8. On the **Stockkeeping Unit Card** page, select the **Use Cross-Docking** check box.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Cross-docking is only possible if your location is set up to require warehouse receive and put-away processing.  

## To cross-dock items without viewing the opportunities  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a warehouse receipt for an item that's arrived and can be cross-docked. To learn more about receiving, go to [Receive Items](warehouse-how-receive-items.md).  
3. Fill in the **Qty. to Receive** field, and then choose the **Calculate Cross-Dock** action.  

    Outbound source documents requesting the items that are scheduled to leave the warehouse within the date formula time period are identified. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates quantities so that you can cross-dock as much as possible and avoid having to put items away, without piling up too many items in the cross-dock area. The value in the **Qty. to Cross-Dock** field is the sum of all the outbound lines for the item within the look-ahead period minus the quantity that is already placed in the cross-dock area, or it is the value in the **Qty. to Receive** field on the receipt line, whichever is smaller. You can't cross-dock more than you have received.  

4. To cross-dock the quantity as suggested, post the receipt. You can also decide to change the quantity to cross-dock to a higher or lower value and then post the receipt.  

    The amounts to be cross-docked now appear as lines in the put-away instruction, assuming the **Use Put-away Worksheet** field is cleared. The quantities not cross-docked also become lines in the put-away instruction.  

    If you have bins, the cross-docked items have been assigned to the default cross-dock bin defined on the location card.  

5. Delete the **Take** and **Place** lines for items that you won't cross-dock.  
6. Print the put-away instruction for the remaining lines, and place the quantities of the receipt that need to be stored in the appropriate bins or in the appropriate area of the warehouse. Place the cross-dock items in the area or bin designated for them by warehouse policy. Sometimes, warehouse policy might require that you to just leave them in the receiving area.  
7. To register the cross-docked items as being put-away and available for picking, choose the **Register** action.  

## To cross-dock items after viewing the opportunities  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a warehouse receipt for an item that has arrived and can be cross-docked.  

    You want to view the source document lines that are requesting the item before you post the receipt.  
3. Choose the **Calculate Cross-Dock** action.  

   On the **Cross-Dock Opportunities** page you can see the most important details about the lines requesting the item, such as type of document, quantity requested, and due date. This information might help you to decide how much to cross-dock, where to place the items in the cross-dock area, or how to group them.  

4. Choose **Autofill Qty. to Cross-Dock** action to show how the quantities on the receipt lines are calculated. When you change the number of items in the **Qty. to Cross-Dock** field on each line, the calculation updates. The update doesn't mean that the shipment or production order will actually receive the items being suggested for cross-docking. It's for testing purposes only. The process can be informative, however, if more than one unit of measure is involved.  
5. To reserve a quantity of the item for an order line, choose the line, and then choose the **Reserve** action. On the **Reservation** page, reserve available quantity of the item. The reservation is like any other reservation and doesn't have higher priority because it was created in connection with cross-docking. To learn more about reservations, go to [Reserve Items](inventory-how-to-reserve-items.md).   
6. When you're finished recalculating or reserving, choose the **OK** button to bring the calculation to the **Qty. to Cross-Dock** field on the receipt line, or choose the **Cancel** button to return to the warehouse receipt and calculate the cross-dock again.  
7. Post the receipt. You can continue in the put-away instruction as described in steps 3 through 7 in [To cross-dock items without viewing the opportunities](#to-cross-dock-items-without-viewing-the-opportunities).  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > In the warehouse put-away, you can continue to change the quantities that are being put away in storage or cross-docked, as necessary. For example, you might decide to cross-dock an extra quantity to expedite the cross-dock registration.  

## To view cross-docked items in a shipment or pick worksheet  

If you're using bins, when you open a shipment or the pick worksheet the quantity of each item in the cross-dock bins updates. When the item is available in the cross-dock bin, you can create a pick for the items on the shipment. In the pick worksheet, you can edit the lines as needed.  

When a production order is released, the lines are available in the pick worksheet and the **Qty. on Cross-Dock Bin** field shows whether the items have arrived and are in the cross-dock bins. When you create a pick instruction, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests that you pick the cross-docked items first. Items in storage bins are suggested afterward.  

If you aren't using bins, remember to check the cross-dock area from time to time, or rely on notifications from receipts that items for production have arrived.

# Record special sales prices and discounts

> [!NOTE]
> 2020 release wave 2 introduced new, streamlined processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer using the latest version, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you are using the new experience depends on whether your administrator has enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. Learn more at [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management) in the administration content.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports various pricing strategies, such as:

* One-price-fits-all models where an item is always sold at the same price.
* Special price agreements with specific customers, or groups of customers.
* Campaigns when a sale meets the criteria for a special offer. For example, you might have the following criteria for an order:

  * It meets a minimum quantity
  * It's before a certain date
  * It includes a certain type of item  

To use a basic pricing model, you only need to specify a unit price when you set up an item or resource. That price will always be used on sales documents. For more advanced models, for example, when you want to offer special prices for a sales campaign, you can specify criteria on the **Sales Prices** page. You can offer special prices based on a combination of the following information:  

* Customer
* Item
* Unit of measure
* Minimum quantity
* Dates that define the period for which the prices are valid.

After you set up special prices, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can calculate best prices on sales and purchase documents, and on lines on projects and item journals. Learn more at [Best Price Calculation](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md#best-price-calculation).

For sales discounts, you can set up two types:

| Discount Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Sales Line Discount** |Add an amount on sales lines that have a certain combination of customer, item, minimum quantity, unit of measure, or starting and ending date. This type works in the same way as for sales prices. |
| **Invoice Discount** |A discount percentage that is subtracted from the sales document total if the sum of all lines on the document exceeds a certain minimum. |

> [!TIP]  
> If an item should never be sold with a discount, leave the discount fields on the item page empty, and do not include the item in any line discount setups.

## To set up a sales price for a customer

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator has turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update. If the feature update isn't turned on, follow the steps on the Current Experience tab. 

#### [Current experience](#tab/current-experience/)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Prices** action.
3. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Fill a line for each combination that will grant a special sales price to the customer.

#### [New experience](#tab/new-experience/)  

By default, the status of new price lists is **Draft**. Draft price lists aren't included in price calculations. When you're done adding lines and want to start using the prices, change the status to **Active**.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Sales Price Lists** action. 
3. Choose **New** to create a new sales price list.
4. On the **General** and **Tax** FastTabs, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. To add items to the list, do one of the following steps:
   * To add many items, choose **Suggest Lines**, and then enter filter criteria to specify the types of items to add. Optionally, you can enter other settings for the items that are specific to the price list. You can change these settings later if needed.
   * To copy items from another price list, choose **Copy Lines**, and then choose the price list to copy.
   * To add items manually, in the grid, in the **Product Type** field, choose the type of product that the price list is for. Depending on your selection, fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. To start using the price list, in the **Status** field, choose **Active**.  

---

## Using sales and purchase price lists

> [!NOTE]
> Using price lists requires that your administrator has enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. Learn more at [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management) in the administration content.

Most of the new sales pricing experience is similar to the current experience, but there are a few differences. Those differences are described in the following sections.

The **Applies-to Type** and **Applies-to No.** fields let you choose what a price list will apply to, such as customer or customer price group. Using **View Columns for**, you can show or hide columns relevant for setting prices, discounts, or prices and discounts.

### Converting existing prices when you turn on the pricing feature update

When you enable the **New sales pricing experience** feature update on the **Feature Management** page, the **Feature Data Update** guide opens. Use the **Use default prices** toggle as follows:

* If you want to work with all prices on a single page, turn it on. Existing prices will be converted to one default price list for each of the following documents:

  * Sales
  * Purchases
  * Job sales
  * Job purchases

  You can edit all prices for these areas on the **Prices Worksheet** page. The default price lists will be set on the **Sales & Receivables Setup**, **Purchases & Payables Setup,** and **Projects Setup** pages.

> [!NOTE]
> If prices are set only on item or resource cards, default price lists will not be filled in with those prices during the data update. However, you can open any of the default price lists or the **Price Worksheet** page and use the **Suggest Lines** action to add the prices set on item or resource cards.

* To use sales price lists, turn it off. Existing prices will be converted to a new price list for each combination of the following things:

  * Customer
  * Customer group or campaign
  * Starting and ending dates
  * Currencies

If you have many combinations, you'll have many price lists.

If you've already enabled the New Pricing Experience, you can create default price lists manually or specify an existing price list as the default. To set an existing price list as default, turn on the **Allow Updating Defaults** toggle on the price list. Then, on the **Sales & Receivables Setup**, **Purchase & Payables**, or **Projects Setup** pages, set the price list as the default.

### Editing active price lists

To allow people to edit prices on active price lists for items, resources, customers, vendors, or other entities that use pricing, turn on the **Allow Editing Active Price** toggle on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** and **Purchase & Payables Setup** pages.

When the **Allow Editing Active Price** toggle is turned off, to update prices in a price list you must change the status of the price list to **Draft**, make your change, and then reactivate the price list.

The **Prices Overview** page provides an overview of all prices across price lists. You can set filters to narrow down the list of prices you may want to modify or add to. After you modify prices, you must use the **Verify Lines** action to verify the prices against other price list lines. Verifying prices helps avoid duplicates and ambiguity during price calculation.

> [!NOTE]
> When you edit a line in an active price list the status of the line becomes **Draft**, and the line will not be considered during price calculation until you use the **Verify Lines** action. After you verify the price the line's status becomes **Active** and it will be considered in price calculations.

To add new prices, on the **Prices Overview** page, use the **Add New Lines** action. The **Prices Worksheet** page opens, and you can add price lines either by suggesting them based on criteria, copying them from other price lists, or manually entering them. Afterward, you can use the **Implement Price Change** action to compare the new prices with other price lists to avoid duplicates and ambiguity during price calculation.

#### Create sales price lines based on the unit price

1. On the **Prices Worksheet** page, choose the **Suggest Lines** action.
2. On the **Price Lines - Create new** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. On the **Product filter** field, define filters for the selected **Product Type**.
4. Choose the **Defaults** field to specify settings such as:
   * Which entities the price list will be assigned to.
   * Dates when the price is valid.
   * The currency code.
   * The amount type filter that defines the columns shown on the price list lines.
5. Choose **OK**. New lines will be added to the **Price Worksheet** page with the selected settings and the unit prices from the item cards.
6. Edit the created lines with the new unit prices or discounts. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

#### Create sales price lines based on existing price lists

1. On the **Prices Worksheet** page, choose the **Copy Lines** action.
2. On the **Price Lines - Copy existing** page, select an existing price list on the **From Price List** field.
3. On the **Price Line filter** field, define filters for the products on the selected price list.
4. Choose the **Defaults** field to specify settings such as:
   * Which entities the price list will be assigned to.
   * Dates when the price is valid.
   * The currency code.
   * The amount type filter that defines the columns shown on the price list lines.
5. Fill in the other fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. Choose **OK**. New lines will be added to the **Price Worksheet** page with the selected settings.
7. Edit the created lines with the new unit prices or discounts. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To copy sales prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator has turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update. If the feature update isn't turned on, follow the steps on the Current Experience tab.

#### [Current experience](#tab/current-experience/)  

If you want to copy sales prices, such as an individual customer's sales prices to use for a customer price group, you must run the **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** batch job on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** action.  
3. On the **Sales Prices** FastTab, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** fields with the original sales prices you want to copy.  
4. In the top section of the request page, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** fields with the type and name you want the sales prices copied to.  
5. If you want the batch job to create new prices, select the **Create New Prices** checkbox.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill in the lines on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page with the suggested new prices, indicating that they're valid for the selected sales type.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > This batch job only creates suggestions and it does not implement the suggested changes. If you are satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them, that is insert them on the **Sales Prices** page, choose the **Implement Price Changes** action on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.

#### [New experience](#tab/new-experience/)  

You can specify the settings that the price list will use:

* Use the settings from the header on the list you're copying.
* Use the settings from the list you're copying to. To use the settings from the price list you're copying prices to, turn on the **Use defaults from target** toggle.

## To bulk update item prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator has turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update. If the feature update isn't turned on, follow the steps on the Current Experience tab.

#### [Current experience](#tab/current-experience/)

To bulk update item prices, such as increase all prices by a percentage, you can fill in the Sales Price Worksheet page by using the following batch jobs:

* **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** suggests changes in one of two ways:

  * By applying an adjustment factor to existing sales prices.
  * By copying existing sales price agreements to other customers, customer price groups, or sales campaigns.

* **Suggest Item Price on Wksh.** suggests changes in one of two ways:

  * By applying an adjustment factor to existing unit prices on item cards.
  * By suggesting prices for new combinations of currency, units of measure, and so on.

  This batch job doesn't change the unit prices on items.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Suggest Item Price on Wksh.** action.  
3. On the **Item** FastTab, fill in the **No.** or **Inventory Posting Group** or other fields with the original item prices you want to update.  
4. In the top section of the request page, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** with the type and name you want the sales prices copied to.
5. If you want the batch job to automatically adjust suggested item prices, enter the adjustment in the **Adjustment Factor** field. For example, you would enter 1.15 in **Adjustment Factor** for a 15% increase in item price.  
6. If you want the batch job to create new prices, turn on the **Create New Prices** toggle.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to fill in the lines on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page with the suggested new prices.
8. To implement the suggestions, use the **Implement Price Changes** action. The batch job creates suggestions but doesn't implement them. 

#### [New experience](#tab/new-experience/)

To update prices for multiple items, you must create a new price list, and then copy the lines from an existing price list. When you copy the lines you can use filters to specify what to copy, and you can specify an integer or decimal number in the **Adjustment Factor** field to increase or decrease prices. The price list must be in the **Draft** status. If needed, you can then deactivate the old price list.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't have two lines that have the same settings but different prices. If that happens, a message will display when you activate a price list. You can choose the price to use by opening the list and deleting the incorrect price.  

---

## Best price calculation

After you record special prices and line discounts for sales and purchases, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the best price on sales and purchase documents, and on project and item journal lines.

The best price is the lowest price with the highest line discount allowed on a given date. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates best prices when it adds unit prices and the line discount percentages on document and journal lines.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following describes how the best price is calculated for sales. For purchases, the calculation is similar but is based on the available parameters. For example, item discount groups are not supported for purchasing.

1. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks the combination of the bill-to customer and the item and then calculates the applicable unit price and line discount percentage, using the following criteria:

    * Does the customer have a price/discount agreement, or does the customer belong to a group that does?
    * Is the item or the item discount group on the line included in any of these price/discount agreements?
    * Is the date within the starting and ending date of the price/discount agreement? For invoices and credit memos, this is the date in the **Posting Date** field on the document header. For all other documents, it's the date in the **Order Date** field on their headers.
    * Is a unit of measure code specified? If so, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks for prices/discounts with the same unit of measure code, and prices/discounts with no unit of measure code.

2. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks whether any price/discount agreements apply to information on the document or journal line. It then inserts the applicable unit price and line discount percentage using the following criteria:

    * Is there a minimum quantity requirement in the price/discount agreement that is fulfilled?
    * Is there a currency requirement in the price/discount agreement that is fulfilled? If so, the lowest price and the highest line discount for that currency are inserted, even if local currency would provide a better price. If there's no price/discount agreement for the specified currency code, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] inserts the lowest price and the highest line discount in your local currency.

If no special price can be calculated for the item on the line, then either the last direct cost or the unit price from the item card is inserted.

## Sales invoice discounts and service charges

When you use invoice discounts, the total amount on the invoice determines the size of the discount that is granted. On the **Cust. Invoice Discounts** page, you can also add a service charge to invoices over a certain amount.  

Before you can use invoice discounts with sales, you must specify certain information. You must make the following decisions:  

* Which customers will be granted this type of discount?  
* Which discount percentages you'll use?  

If you want invoice discounts to be calculated automatically, on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, turn on the **Calc Inv. Discount** toggle.  

You can specify whether you'll grant invoice discounts when an invoice meets certain criteria for each customer. For example, when the invoice amount is large enough. Invoice discounts can be in local currency for domestic customers, or in foreign currency for foreign customers.  

You link discount percentages to specific invoice amounts on the **Cust. Invoice Discounts** page for each customer. You can enter any number of percentages. Each customer can have their own page, or you can link several customers to the same page.  

In addition to, or instead of, a discount percentage, you can link a service charge amount to a specific invoice amount.  

> [!TIP]  
> Before you enter this information, it's a good idea to prepare an outline of the discount structure that you want to use. The structure makes it easier to determine which customers can be linked to the same invoice discount page. The fewer pages you have to set up, the faster you can enter the basic information.

For training in discounts in sales, see [Set up discounts for your customers](/training/modules/customer-discounts-dynamics-365-business-central/index).

# Create production BOMs

A production bill of material (BOM) holds master data that describes the components and subassemblies used in the production of an item. When you create a production order for an item, its production BOM governs the calculation of material requirements as represented on the **Prod. Order Components** page.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also supports assembly BOMs. Use assembly orders to make end items from components in a process that one or more basic resources, which aren't machine or work centers, can do. Or, a process that can complete without any resources. For example, an assembly process could be to pick two wine bottles and one coffee sack and then pack them as a gift item. To learn more, go to [Assembly BOMs or Production BOMs](inventory-how-work-boms.md#assembly-boms-or-production-boms).  

> [!TIP]
> The **Contoso Coffee Demo Data** app includes demonstration products for a variety of production BOM scenarios that can be used on a test environment, including during a trial. Learn how to set up the Contoso Coffee Data and find walkthroughs for different scenarios at [Introduction to Contoso Coffee Demo Data](contoso-coffee/contoso-coffee-intro.md).

Before you can set up a routing, the following setups must be in place:  

- Item cards are created for parent items that take part in manufacturing. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).
- Production resources are set up. To learn more, go to [Set Up Work Centers and Machine Centers](production-how-to-set-up-work-and-machine-centers.md).

## To create a production BOM

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Production BOMs**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. To edit the BOM, set the **Status** field to **New** or **Under Development**. To activate it, set the **Status** field to **Certified**.  

    Proceed to fill in the production BOM lines.
5. In the **Type** field, select whether the item on this BOM line is an ordinary item or a production BOM. If the item on the line is a production BOM, then it must already exist as a certified production BOM.  
6. In the **No.** field, look up and select the item or production BOM in question, or type it in the field.  

   > [!TIP]
   > If you need to add several items, you can use the **Select items** action to select and add them. You can also use the **Edit in Excel** action. You can make changes to records in Excel, and then update the data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about the Edit in Excel action, go to [Edit in Excel](across-work-with-excel.md#edit-in-excel).

7. In the **Quantity per** field, enter how many units of the item go into the parent item, for example, 4 wheels for 1 car.  
8. In the **Scrap %** field, you can enter a fixed percentage of components that are scrapped during production. When the components are ready to be consumed in a released production order, this percentage is added to the expected quantity in the **Consumption Quantity** field in a production journal. To learn more, go to [Register Consumption and Output](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md).  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This scrap percentage represents components that are scrapped during production when picking from inventory. The scrap percentage on routing lines represents scrapped output before it's put in inventory.  

9. In the **Routing Link Code** field, enter a code to connect the component to a specific operation. To learn more, go to [To create routing links](production-how-to-create-routings.md#to-create-routing-links).
10. To copy lines from an existing production BOM, choose the **Copy BOM** action to select existing lines.  
11. Certify the production BOM.  
12. You can now attach the new production BOM to the card of the parent item in question. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> [!INCLUDE [bom-standard-cost](includes/bom-standard-cost.md)] To recalculate the item's standard cost from the item card, choose the **Production** action, then choose the **Calc. Production Std. Cost** action. You can also calculate and update the standard cost for one or many items on the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page. To learn more, go to [Update Standard Costs](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md#updating-standard-costs-with-standard-cost-worksheet).  

## To create a new version of a production BOM

For example, use new versions of production BOMs when an item is replaced, or when a customer requires a special version of a product. The version principle enables various versions of a production BOM to be managed. The structure of the production BOM version corresponds to the structure of the production BOM. The basic difference is in the time validity of the versions. The starting date defines the validity.  

The starting date indicates the start of the period in which this version is valid. For all other considerations, the starting date is a filter criterion for calculations and evaluations. The BOM version is valid until the next version becomes valid for its starting date. You can quickly go to the certified BOM or BOM version that's valid on the work date by choosing the **Prod. Active BOM Version** action.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Production BOMs**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the production BOM to be copied, then choose the **Versions** action.  
3. Choose the **New** action.  
4. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. In the **Version Code** field, enter the unique identification of the version. Any combination of numbers and letters is permitted.  

    The newly created version is automatically assigned the status **New**.
6. When the BOM version is completed, setting the **Status** field to **Certified**.  

The time validity of the version is specified by the **Starting Date** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Select the **Item** option in the **Type** field to use an item from your item master data in the production BOM. If the item also has a production BOM, whereby the **Production BOM No.** field is filled in on the item card, this production BOM is also considered.  
>
> Select the **Production BOM** option if you want to use a phantom production BOM on the line.  
>
> Phantom production BOMs serve for structuring products. This production BOM type never leads to a finished product but is used exclusively for determining the dependent demand. Phantom production BOMs don't have their own item master data.

## Compare production BOM versions

Use the **Production BOM Version Comparison** page to access a list of all production BOM versions and items and the quantity used per item. You can use the matrix to compare different production BOM versions for the used items per version, including the original BOM as the first column. This page gives you an overview of all BOM versions and their respective quantities.

## Quantity calculation formula on production BOMs

The quantity is calculated taking into consideration different dimensions that are also entered on the production BOM lines. The dimensions refer to an order unit of the respective item. The length, width, depth, and weight can be entered as dimensions.  

The Calculation Formula, Length, Width, Depth, and Weight columns aren't displayed, because they're only used by some users. If you wish to use the calculation of the quantity, you must first display these columns.  

The calculation formula defines the relation of the individual components. The following options are available as a calculation formula:  

- **Empty** - No consideration of dimensions. (Quantity = Quantity per.)  
- **Length** - Quantity = Quantity per * Length  
- **Length x Width** - Quantity = Quantity per * Length x Width  
- **Length x Width x Depth** - Quantity = Quantity per x Length x Width x Depth  
- **Weight** - Quantity = Quantity per x Weight  
- **Fixed Quantity** - Quantity = Quantity per

> [!NOTE]
> The **Fixed Quantity** calculation formula ensures that the consumption of a component is the same, regardless of the scrap or output quantities. For production order components, when the **Calculation Formula** field is set to **Fixed Quantity**, the **Expected Quantity** field value is always equal to the **Quantity per** field. The scrap percentage that is defined on the same line is ignored. Fixed quantity is respected by the **Availability by BOM** report. The report will show the item as the bottleneck if the available quantity is less than the quantity in the **Quantity Per Parent** field. The **Able to Make Parent** and **Able to Make Top Item** fields are always blank, regardless of the available quantity. Fixed quantity is also included in calculations for standard costs. The lot size for the produced item impacts the cost that is allocated for one item.

### Example

A production BOM requires 70 metal parts with the dimensions length = 0.20 m and width = 0.15 m. Enter the values as follows: Calculation Formula = Length x Width, Length = 20, Width = 15, Quantity per = 70.

Quantity per x Length * Width, that is, Quantity = 70 x 0.20 m x 0.15 m = 2.1 m2, gives the quantity.

# Viewing table information

The **8700 Table Information** page provides information about the number of records in all system and business tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and how much data each table contains.

This information is useful for troubleshooting performance problems because it shows the distribution of data sizes across tables.

## View table information

To open this page, select the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Table Information**, and then choose the related link.

The following table describes the information provided for each table:

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Company Name|The name of the company, if any, that the table belongs to.|
|Table Name|The name of the table.|
|Table No.|The ID of the table.|
|No. of Records|The total number of records stored in the table.|
|Record Size|The average record size in KB/record. The value is calculated using the following formula: 1024(Size)/(No. of Records). |
|Size (KB)|The total amount of space the table occupies in the database. This value is the sum of the values in the Data Size and Index Size fields.|
|Data Size (KB)|How much space the data in the base table occupies in the database.|
|Index Size (KB)|How much space the table indexes (keys) on the base table occupy in the database.|
|Compression|The type of compression, **Row**, **Page**, or **None** that is applied to the table in the database. To learn more, go to [Data compression](/sql/relational-databases/data-compression/data-compression?).|

> [!NOTE]
> If you delete data in a table, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] starts several processes behind the scenes to make sure that everything is cleaned up in your database. The values on the Table Information page don't update until those processes are complete, which can take a while. The amount of time it takes can vary, depending on the size of your database.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The **Table Information** page shows data and index (key) sizes for the base table. It doesn't include the sizes for *indexed views* used to maintain SIFT totals and it doesn't include the data and index sizes used by table extensions. Furthermore, the sum of table sizes doesn't match the total capacity used because it displays the data size, not the actual allocated size. Allocated space is always larger than used space to avoid having to allocate space on every insert, which would limit performance significantly.

# Manufacturing

> [!NOTE]
> The features this article describes are available only if you have the **Premium** experience. To learn more, go to [Change Which Features are Displayed](ui-experiences.md).

When demand is planned for and the materials are issued according to production BOMs, production operations can start in the sequence defined by the production order routing.  

An important part of production, from a system point of view, is to post production output to report progress and to update inventory with the finished items. You can post output manually, by filling in and posting journal lines after production operations. Or, it can post automatically with the use of backward flushing. In that case, material consumption is automatically posted along with output when the production order changes to finished.  

As an alternative to the batch journal for output posting for multiple production orders, you can use the **Production Journal** page to post consumption and/or output for one production order line.

There are a few things to set up before you can start production. For example, work centers, routings, and production BOMs. To learn more, go to [Setting Up Manufacturing](production-configure-production-processes.md).

# Define an invoice posting policy for users

Companies often have unique processes for posting sales and purchase invoices and shipments. For example, processes can vary from one person posting everything on a purchase order, to multiple employees. You can restrict users from posting invoices, or require that invoices are posted together with shipments or receipts.

## To specify a posting policy

On the **User Setup** page, in the **Sales Invoice Posting Policy** and **Purch. Invoice Posting Policy** fields, choose one of the following options:

* **Allowed** (Default) - Keep the current behavior, where a user can choose the posting option to use, such as **Ship**, **Invoice**, and **Ship and Invoice**. 
* **Prohibited** - Prevent the user from posting invoices. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows a confirmation dialog that provides only the **Ship** or **Receive** options.
* **Mandatory** - Allow the user to post invoices together with receipts or shipments. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows a confirmation dialog with the **Ship and Invoice** or **Receive and Invoice** options.

## Effect on documents

The following table describes how invoice posting policies affect documents.

> [!NOTE]
> When you post sales and purchase invoices and credit memos, you don't have any posting options. The documents always post the physical and financial transactions together. You can't partially post invoices and credit memos.

|Document | Option 1: Allow <br>Displays a series of options| Option 2: Prohibited <br>Confirmation dialog | Option 3: Mandatory <br>Confirmation dialog|
|--|--|--|--|
|Sales order |- Ship <br>- Invoice <br>- Ship and Invoice |Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|
|Sales invoice|No options| Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the invoice?|
|Sales credit memo|No options|Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the credit memo?|
|Sales return order |- Receive <br>- Invoice <br>- Receive and Invoice |Do you want to post the receipt? |Do you want to post the receipt and invoice?|
|Inventory pick |- Ship <br>- Ship and Invoice |Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|
|Purchase order |- Receive <br>- Invoice <br>- Receive and Invoice |Do you want to post the receipt? |Do you want to post the receipt and invoice?|
|Purchase invoice|No options|Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the invoice?|
|Purchase credit memo|No options|Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the credit memo?|
|Purchase Return Order |- Ship <br>- Invoice <br>- Ship and Invoice |Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|
|Inventory Put-away |- Receive <br>- Receive and Invoice |Do you want to post the receipt? |Do you want to post the receipt and invoice?|
|Warehouse Shipment |- Ship <br>- Ship and Invoice | Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|

   > [!Note]
   > The setting doesn't affect posting of general journal lines where you can select **Invoice** in the **Document Type** field.

title: Overview of tasks to manage receivables
description: This article outlines tasks to manage receivables and apply payments to customer or vendor ledger entries.

# Managing receivables

A regular step in any financial rhythm is to reconcile bank accounts. To close sales invoices and purchase credit memos as paid, you apply incoming payments to customer or vendor ledger entries.

While most customers in B2B environments pay some time after delivery, leaving the posted sales invoices open for the Accounts Receivable department to close (apply) when payment is received, some sales invoices can be paid immediately, for example with PayPal. Such invoices are immediately applied as paid when they're posted and, therefore, don't appear as payments to be processes in AR. For more information, see, for example, [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).  

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], one of the fastest ways to register payments is with the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page by importing a bank statement file or feed. The payments are applied to open customer or vendor ledger entries based on data matches between payment text and entry information. You can review and change the matches before you post the journal, and close bank account ledger entries for ledger entries when you post the journal. The bank account is reconciled when all payments are applied.

Other pages exist where you can either apply payments or reconcile bank accounts:

* The **Bank Account Reconciliations** page, where you reconcile bank accounts by matching imported bank statement lines with your system bank account ledger entries. Here, you can also reconcile check payments. For more information, see [Reconcile Bank Accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md). Here, you can't apply payments.
* The **Payment Registration** page, where you can manually apply payments received as cash, check, or bank transaction against a generated list of unpaid sales documents. This functionality is available only for sales documents. Here, you can't apply outgoing payments, and you can't reconcile bank accounts.
* The **Cash Receipt Journal** page, where you manually post receipts to the relevant general ledger, customer, or other account by entering a payment line. You can either apply the receipt or refund to one or more open entries before you post the cash receipt journal, or from the customer ledger entries. Here, you can't reconcile bank accounts.

The **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page uses automatic matching logic that you can set up on the **Payment Application Rules** page. For more information, see [Set Up Rules for Automatic Application of Payments](receivables-how-set-up-payment-application-rules.md).  

Other aspects of managing receivables include to collect outstanding balances, including finance charges and reminders, and to set bank accounts up to allow customers' payments to be withdrawn from their account automatically.

# Work with VAT on sales and purchases

If your country or region requires you to calculate and report value-added tax (VAT) on sales and purchase transactions, you can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to calculate VAT. For more information, see [Setting Up to Calculations and Posting Methods for Value-Added Tax](finance-setup-vat.md).

There are, however, some VAT-related tasks that you can do manually. For example, you might need to correct a posted amount if you discover that a vendor uses a different rounding method.  

> [!TIP]
> You can let [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] validate VAT registration numbers and other company information when you create or update documents. For more information, see [Validate VAT Registration Numbers](finance-how-validate-vat-registration-number.md).

## Calculating and displaying VAT amounts on sales and purchase documents  

When you choose an item number in the **No.** field on a sales or purchase document, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fills in the **Unit Price** and **Line Amount** fields. The unit price comes from either the **Item** card or the item prices allowed for the item and customer. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the line amount when you enter a quantity for the line.  

If you want the unit prices and line amounts to include VAT, for example, if you sell to retail consumers, choose the **Prices Including VAT** check box on the document. For more information, see [Including or Excluding VAT in Prices and Line Amounts](#including-or-excluding-vat-in-prices-and-line-amounts). 

You can calculate and display VAT amounts in sales and purchase documents differently. The difference depends on the type of customer or vendor you're dealing with. You can also change the calculated VAT amount manually, for example, so that it matches the VAT amount calculated by your vendor on a given transaction.

### Including or excluding VAT in prices and line amounts

If you choose the **Prices Including VAT** checkbox on a sales document, the **Unit Price** and **Line Amount** fields include VAT. By default, the values in these fields don't include VAT. The names of the fields reflect whether prices include VAT.  

You can set up the default setting of the **Prices Including VAT** for all sales documents for a customer in the **Prices Including VAT** field on the **Customer** card. You can also set up item prices to include or exclude VAT. Typically, prices on the Item Card exclude VAT.

The following table provides an overview of how the application calculates the unit price amounts for a sales document when prices aren't set up on the **Sales Prices** page:  

|**Price Includes VAT field on Item Card**|**Prices Including VAT field**|**Action Performed**|  
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|  
|Not Enabled|Not Enabled|The **Unit Price** on the Item Card is copied to **Unit Price Excl. VAT** field on the sales lines.|  
|Not Enabled|Enabled|The application calculates the VAT amount per unit and adds to the **Unit Price** on the Item Card. This total unit price is then entered in the **Unit Price Incl. VAT field** on the sales lines.|  
|Enabled|Not Enabled|The application calculates the VAT amount included in the **Unit Price** field on the **Item Card** using the VAT percentage related to the VAT Bus. Posting Gr. (Price) and the VAT Prod. Posting Group combination. The **Unit Price** on the Item Card, reduced by the VAT amount, is then entered in the **Unit Price Excl. VAT** field in the sales lines. For more information, see [Using VAT Business Posting Groups and Customer Price Groups](finance-work-with-vat.md#using-vat-business-posting-groups-and-customer-price-groups).|  
|Enabled|Enabled|The **Unit Price** on the Item Card is copied to **Unit Price Incl. VAT** field on the sales lines.|

#### Using VAT business posting groups and customer price groups 

If you want prices to include VAT, you can use VAT business posting groups to calculate the amount based on the VAT posting setup for the group. For more information, see [Set up VAT business posting groups](finance-setup-vat.md#set-up-vat-business-posting-groups).

Depending on what you want to do, you can assign a VAT business posting group to customers or sales documents in the following ways:

* To use the same VAT rate for all customers, you can choose a group in the **VAT Business Posting Group (Price)** field on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.
* To use a VAT rate for a specific customer, you can choose a group in the **VAT Business Posting Group (Price)** field on the **Customer Card** page. 
* To use a VAT rate for a specific of customers, you can choose a group in the **VAT Business Posting Group (Price)** field on the **Customer Price Group** page. For example, this setting is useful when you want a price to apply to all customers in a certain geographical region or a specific industry.
* On all sales documents, in the **VAT Business Posting Group** field. The VAT amount specified for the group is used only for the document you're currently working on.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not specify a group in the **VAT Business Posting Group (Price)** field VAT will not be included in prices.

#### Examples

Factors such as the country or region you're selling in, or the type of industries you sell to, can affect the amount of VAT that you must account for. For example, a restaurant might charge 6% VAT for meals that are eaten in-house, and 17% for takeaway. To accomplish that, you create a VAT business posting group (price) for in-house and one for takeaway.

## Working with VAT Date

### VAT Date in documents

When you create new sales or purchase documents, the **VAT Date** is based on the setting in the **Default VAT Date** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page. This default value can be the same as **Posting Date** or **Document Date**. If you need a different VAT date, you can manually change the value in the **VAT Date** field. When you post the document, the **VAT Date** is shown on the posting document and on the VAT and G/L entries.

> [!NOTE]
> If the **VAT Date** field isn't available on your documents or journals, that means that **Do not use VAT Date functionality** is chosen in the **VAT Date Usage** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you configure **Control VAT Period** in the **General Ledger Setup** as **Block posting within closed period**, or **Block posting within closed and warn for released period**, you can post document or journal only if the date in the **VAT Date** field is not in a closed period in **VAT Return Periods**. Even if the period in **VAT Return Periods** is open, you might get a warning based on the **VAT Return Status** and configuration in the **Control VAT Period**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting in version 23.1, you can prevent or allow posting of the **VAT Date** for specific data range, using the **Allow VAT Date From** and **Allow VAT Date To** fields in the **VAT Setup** and the **User Setup**. If you are using older versions, you can prevent or allow posting of the **VAT Date** for specific data range, using the **Allow Posting From** and **Allow Posting To** fields in the **General Ledger Setup** and the **User Setup**.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you leave the **VAT Date** blank, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use your default setup from **Default VAT Date** in the **General Ledger Setup** as a **VAT Date** in the posted transaction.  

### Modifying the VAT Date in posted entries

If needed, you can change the VAT date posted documents. To change the date in the **VAT Date** field for posted documents, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Entries**, and then choose the related link. 
2. Find the entry with wrong VAT date.  
3. Choose the **Edit list** action, and then enter the correct date in the **VAT Date** field.  
4. When you close the page, the VAT date changes in related **G/L Entries** and in the posted document.  

> [!NOTE]
> You can change the **VAT Date** field in **VAT Entries** only if your current date is not in a closed VAT return period. Even if the period in the **VAT Return Periods** field is open, you might get a warning based on the **VAT Return Status**.  

> [!NOTE]
> If your document has more than one **VAT Entry**, you only need to change the value in the **VAT Date** field in one entry related to the document. To keep entries consistent, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically changes the VAT date in VAT entries related to this transaction. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will update the **VAT Date** in other tables (GL Entries and documents), but only related to this transaction.  

## Correcting VAT amounts manually on sales and purchase documents  

You can make corrections to posted VAT entries so that you can change the total sales or purchase VAT amounts without changing the VAT base. For example, if you receive an invoice from a vendor with an incorrect VAT amount.  

Although you might have one or more combinations set up to handle import VAT, you must set up at least one VAT product posting group. For example, you can name it **CORRECT** for correction purposes, unless you can use the same general ledger account in the **Purchase VAT Account** field on the VAT posting setup line. For more information, see [Setting Up to Calculations and Posting Methods for Value-Added Tax](finance-setup-vat.md).

If a payment discount was calculated based on an invoice amount that includes VAT, you revert the payment discount part of the VAT amount when you grant the payment discount. You must activate the **Adjust for Payments Disc.** field in both the general ledger setup in general and the VAT posting setup for specific combinations of a VAT business posting group and a VAT product posting group.  

### To set the system up for manual VAT entry in sales documents

To enable manual VAT changes on sales documents, follow these steps. The steps are similar on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page.

1. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, specify a **Max. VAT Difference Allowed** between the amount calculated by application and the manual amount.  
2. On the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, turn on the **Allow Vat Difference** toggle.  

### To adjust VAT for a sales document

1. Open the relevant sales order.  
2. Choose the **Statistics** action.  
3. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, choose the value in the **No. of Tax Lines** field.
4. Edit the **VAT Amount** field.   

> [!NOTE]  
> The total VAT amount for the invoice, grouped by VAT identifier, is displayed in the lines. You can manually adjust the amount in the **VAT Amount** field on the lines for each VAT identifier. When you modify the **VAT Amount** field, application checks to ensure that you have not changed the VAT by more than the amount you have specified as the maximum difference allowed. If the amount is outside the range of the **Max. VAT Difference Allowed**, a warning will be displayed stating the maximum allowed difference. You will be unable to proceed until the amount is adjusted to within the acceptable parameters. Click **OK** and enter another **VAT Amount** that is within the allowed range. If the VAT difference is equal to or lower than the maximum allowed, the VAT will be divided proportionally among the document lines that have the same VAT identifier.  

## Calculating VAT manually using journals  

You can also adjust VAT amounts in general, sales, and purchase journals. For example, you might need an adjustment if you enter a vendor invoice in your journal and the VAT amount that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculated and the VAT amount on the vendor's invoice differ.  

### To set the system up for manual VAT entry in general journals

You must perform the following steps before you manually enter VAT in a general journal.  

1. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, specify a **Max. VAT Difference Allowed** between the amount calculated by application and the manual amount.  
2. On the **General Journal Templates** page, choose the **Allow VAT Difference** check box for the relevant journal.  

### To set the system up for manual VAT entry in a sales and purchase journals

You must perform the following steps before you manually enter VAT in a sales or purchase journal.

1. On the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page, choose the **Allow VAT Difference** check box.  
2. Repeat step 1 for the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.
3. After you complete the setup, you can adjust the **VAT Amount** field on the general journal line, or the **Bal. VAT Amount** field on the sales or purchase journal line. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies that the difference isn't greater than the specified maximum.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the difference is greater, a warning will be displayed stating the maximum allowed difference. To continue, you must adjust the amount. Choose **OK** and then enter an amount that is within the allowed range. If the VAT difference is equal to or lower than the maximum allowed, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will show the difference in the **VAT Difference** field.  

## Posting Import VAT with Purchase Invoices
Instead of using journals to post an import VAT invoice, you can use a purchase invoice.  

### To set up purchasing for posting import VAT invoices

1. Set up a vendor card for the import authority that sends you the import VAT invoice. The **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** and **VAT Bus. Posting Group** must be set up in the same way as the general ledger account for the import VAT.  
2. Create a **Gen. Product Posting Group** for the import VAT and set up an import VAT **Def. VAT Product Posting Group** for the related **Gen. Product Posting Group**.  
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
4. Select the import VAT general ledger account, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
5. On the **Posting** FastTab, select the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** setup for import VAT. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically fills in the **VAT Prod. Posting Group** field.  
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
7. Create a combination of the **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** for the VAT authority and the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** for import VAT. For this combination, in the **Purchase Account** field, choose the import VAT general ledger account.  

### To create a new invoice for the import authority vendor after you complete the setup  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new purchase invoice.  
3. In the **Buy-from Vendor No.** field, choose the import authority vendor, and then choose the **OK** button.  
4. In the purchase line, in the **Type** field, choose **G/L Account**, and in the **No.** field, choose the import VAT general ledger account.  
5. In the **Quantity** field, type **1**.  
6. In the **Direct Unit Cost Excl. VAT** field, specify the VAT amount.  
7. Post the invoice.  

## Processing certificates of supply

When you sell goods to a customer in another EU country/region, you must send the customer a certificate of supply that the customer must sign and return to you. The following procedures are for processing certificates of supply for sales shipments, but the same steps apply for service shipments of items, and return shipments to vendors.  

### To view certificate of supply details  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Shipments**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the relevant sales shipment to a customer in another EU country/region.  
3. Choose **Certificate of Supply Details**.  
4. By default, if the **Certificate of Supply Required** check box is selected for VAT Posting Group setup for the customer, the **Status** field is set to **Required**. You can update the field to indicate whether the customer returned the certificate.  

> [!Note]  
>  If the VAT Posting Group setup does not have the **Certificate of Supply Required** check box selected, then a record is created and the **Status** field is set to **Not Applicable**. You can update the field to reflect the correct status information. You can manually change the status from **Not Applicable** to **Required**, and from **Required** to **Not Applicable** as needed.  

   When you update the **Status** field to **Required**, **Received**, or **Not Received**, a certificate is created.  

> [!TIP]  
>  You can use the **Certificates of Supply** page to get a view of the status of all posted shipments for which a certificate of supply has been created.  

5. Choose **Print Certificate of Supply**.  

> [!Note]  
> You can preview or print the document. When you choose **Print Certificate of Supply** and print the document, the **Printed** check box is automatically selected. In addition, if not already specified, the status of the certificate is updated to **Required**. If needed, you include the printed certificate with the shipment.  

### To print a certificate of supply

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Shipments**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the relevant sales shipment to a customer in another EU country/region.  
3. Choose the **Print Certificate of Supply** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Alternatively, you can print a certificate from the **Certificate of Supply** page.  

4. To include information from the lines on the shipment document in the certificate, turn on the **Print Line Details** toggle.  
5. To have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] create certificates for posted shipments that didn't have one, turn on the **Create Certificates of Supply if Not Already Created** toggle. When you turn on the toggle, new certificates are created for all posted shipments that don't have certificates within the selected range.  
6. By default, the filter settings are for the shipment document that you selected. Fill in the filter information to select a specific certificate of supply that you want to print.  
7. On the **Certificate of Supply** page, choose the **Print** action to print the report, or choose the **Preview** action to view it on the screen.  

   > [!Note]  
   > The **Certificate of Supply Status** field and the **Printed** field are updated for the shipment on the **Certificates of Supply** page.  

8. Send the printed certificate of supply to the customer for signature.  

### To update the status of a certificate of supply for a shipment  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Shipments**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the relevant sales shipment to a customer in another EU country/region.  
3. In the **Status** field, choose the relevant option.  

   If the customer returned the signed certificate of supply, choose **Received**. The **Receipt Date** field is updated. By default, the receipt date is set to the current work date.  

   You can modify the date to reflect the date that you received the customer's signed certificate of supply. You can also add a link to the signed certificate using standard [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] linking.  

   If the customer doesn't return the signed certificate of supply, choose **Not Received**. You must then send the customer a new invoice that includes VAT, because the tax authority won't accept the original invoice.  

To view a group of certificates, start from the **Certificates of Supply** page, and then update the information about the status of outstanding certificates as you receive them from your customers. The updated information can be useful when you want to search for all certificates that have a certain status, for example, **Required**, for which you want to update their status to **Not Received**.  

### To update the status of a group of certificates of supply  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Certificates of Supply**, and choose the related link.  
2. Filter the **Status** field to the value that you want in order to create the list of certificates that you want to manage.  
3. To update the status information, choose **Edit List**.  
4. In the **Status** field, choose the relevant option.  

   If the customer returned the signed certificate of supply, choose **Received**. The **Receipt Date** field is updated. By default, the receipt date is set to the current work date.  

   You can modify the date to reflect the date that you received the signed the certificate of supply. You can also add a link to the signed certificate using standard [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] document linking.  

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot create a new certificate of supply on the **Certificate of Supply** page when you navigate to it using this procedure. To create a certificate for a shipment that was not set up to require one, open the posted sales shipment, and use either of two procedures described earlier:

# Defer revenues and expenses

To recognize a revenue or an expense in a period other than the period in which the transaction was posted, you can automatically defer revenues and expenses over a specified schedule.

To distribute revenues or expenses on the involved accounting periods, you set up a deferral template for the resource, item, or G/L account that the revenue or expense will be posted for. When you post the related sales or purchase document, the revenue or expense are deferred to the involved accounting periods, according to a deferral schedule that is governed by settings in the deferral template and the posting date.

> [!NOTE]
> Sales and purchase journals validate the source code. The validation requires that the source code for sales and sales journals, and purchase and purchase journals respectively, aren't identical when you're using deferrals. If it's set up to be identical, you can work around this limitation by creating a template and batch that use another source code.

## To set up a G/L account for deferral

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary to create a G/L account for deferred revenues. For more information, see [The General Ledger and the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md).
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to create a new G/L account for deferred expenses.

For both types of deferral, select **Balance Sheet** in the **Type** field, and name the accounts appropriately, such as "Unearned Income" for deferred revenues and "Unpaid Expenses" for deferred expenses.

## To set up a deferral template

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Deferral Templates**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.
4. In the **Calc. Method** field, specify how the **Amount** field for each period on the **Deferral Schedule** page is calculated. You can choose between the following options:

   * **Straight-Line**: The periodic deferral amounts are calculated according to the number of periods, distributed according to period length.
   * **Equal per Period**: The periodic deferral amounts are calculated according to the number of periods, distributed evenly on periods.
   * **Days per Period**: The periodic deferral amounts are calculated according to the number of days in the period.
   * **User-Defined**: The periodic deferral amounts aren't calculated. You must manually fill the **Amount** field for each period in the Deferral Schedule page. For more information, see the “To change a deferral schedule from a sales invoice” section.
5. In the **Period Desc.** field, specify a description that will be shown on entries for the deferral posting. You can enter the following placeholder codes for typical values, which will be inserted automatically when the period description is displayed.

   * %1 = The day number of the period posting date
   * %2 = The week number of the period posting date
   * %3 = The month number of the period posting date
   * %4 = The month name of the period posting date
   * %5 = The accounting period name of the period posting date
   * %6 = The fiscal year of the period posting date

Example: The posting date is 02/06/2016. If you enter “Expenses deferred for %4 %6”, then the description displayed will be "Expenses deferred for February 2016".

## To assign a deferral template to an item

> [!NOTE]  
> The steps in this procedure are the same as when you assign a deferral template to a G/L account or a resource.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the item for which revenues or expenses must be deferred to the accounting periods when the item was sold or purchased.
3. On the **Costs & Posting** FastTab, in the **Default Deferral Template** field, select the relevant deferral template.

## To change a deferral schedule from a sales invoice

> [!NOTE]  
> The steps in this procedure are the same as when you change a deferral schedule, for expenses, from a purchase invoice.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a sales invoice for an item that has a deferral template assigned. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).

    Notice that as soon as you enter the item (or resource or G/L account) on the invoice line, the **Deferral Code** field is filled with the code of the assigned deferral template.
3. Choose the **Deferral Schedule** action.
4. On the **Deferral Schedule** page, change settings on the header or values on the lines, for example to defer the amount to an additional accounting period.
5. Choose the **Calculate Schedule** action.
6. Choose the **OK** button. The deferral schedule is updated for the sales invoice. The related deferral template is unchanged.

## To preview how deferred revenues or expenses will be posted to the general ledger

> [!NOTE]  
> The steps in this procedure are the same as when you preview how expense deferrals are posted.

1. On the **Sales Invoice** page, choose the **Preview Posting** action.
2. On the **Posting Preview** page, choose the **G/L Entry** action, and then choose the **Show Related Entries** action.

G/L entries to be posted to the specified deferral account, for example, Unearned Income, are denoted by the description that you entered in the **Period Desc.** field in the deferral template, for example, "Expenses deferred for February 2016".

## To review posted deferrals in the Sales Deferral Summary report

> [!NOTE]  
> The steps in this procedure are the same as when you review the Purchasing Deferral Summary report.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Deferral Summary**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Sales Deferral Summary** page, in the **Balance as of** field, enter the date up to which you want to see deferred revenues.
3. Choose the **Preview** button.

## To specify a period in which to allow deferral posting

You can specify a period in which people can post transactions by entering dates in the **Allow Posting From** and **Allow Posting To** fields as follows:

* For all users, on the **General Ledger Setup** page
* For specific users, on the **User Setup** page

If you've done that, you must make an exception for deferrals to allow them to be posted outside the period. To define the period, follow these steps.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup** or **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Allow Deferral Posting From** and **Allow Deferral Posting To** fields, enter a start and end date for the period.

### Video guidance

The following video shows how to define the period in which you allow people to post deferred revenue and expenses, and how to specify exceptions.

# Report VAT to tax authorities

This article describes the reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that you can use to submit information about value-added tax (VAT) amounts for sales and purchases to tax authorities in your region. Depending on the specific country/region, the reports might include specific information, or there might be additional reports that you must submit. Check the articles for your country/region in the [Local Functionality](about-localization.md) section.  

You can use the following built-in reports:

* The **EC Sales List** report  

    The European Community (EC) Sales List report lists the value added tax (VAT) amounts that you have collected for sales to VAT-registered customers in the European Union (EU) countries/regioins.  
* The **VAT Return** report  

    The VAT Return report includes VAT for sales and purchases to customers and from vendors in all countries/regions that use VAT.  

In both cases (as in other VAT-related reports), VAT is calculated based on the VAT posting setup and the VAT posting groups that you have set up. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows VAT entries always based on their **VAT Date** as a primary reporting date.  

> [!NOTE]
> All VAT related reports now run using the **VAT Date** to filter relevant records. Even if you set up **VAT Date Usage** as **Do not use VAT Date functionallity** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will hide all instances of the **VAT Date** across the application. However, the **VAT Date** is still used in all reportings and is auto-populated with the **Posting Date**.

If you want to view a complete history of VAT entries, every posting that involves VAT creates an entry on the **VAT Entries** page. These entries are used to calculate your VAT settlement amount, such as your payment and refund, for a specific period. To view VAT entries, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Entries**, and then choose the related link.

> [!NOTE]
> Each [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment is meant to handle regulatory reporting in one single country/region. For example, the Dutch version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] handles VAT reporting in The Netherlands but not in other countries/regions. Similarly, the United States version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] handles 1099 reporting in the United States and does not support claiming VAT reporting in other countries/regions, unless brought by an extension delivered by our partner ecosystem or a customer-specific code modification.

## <a name="ecsaleslist"></a>About the EC Sales List report

In the European Union (EU) and in the UK, all companies that sell goods and services to VAT-registered customers, including customers in other European Union (EU) countries/regions, must submit an electronic version of the European Community (EC) Sales List report to their customs and tax authorities. The **EC Sales List** report works only for countries/regions in the EU.

The report includes one line for each type of transaction with the customer, and displays the total amount for each type of transactions. There are three types of transactions that the report can include:  

* B2B Goods  
* B2B Services  
* B2B Triangulated Goods  

*B2B* goods and services specify whether you sold a good or a service, and are controlled by the **EU Service** setting in the VAT posting setup. *B2B Triangulated Goods* indicate whether you engaged in trade with a 3rd party, and are controlled by the **EU 3-Party Trade** setting on sales documents, such as sales orders, invoices, credit memos, and so on.  

After the tax authority reviews your report, they'll send an email to the contact person for your company. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the contact person is specified on the **Company Information** page. Before you submit the report, make sure that a contact person is chosen.  

### Submit an EC sales list report

[!INCLUDE [finance-ecsaleslist](includes/finance-ecsaleslist.md)]

## <a name="vatreturn"></a>About the VAT Return report

Use this report to submit VAT for sales and purchase documents, such as purchase and sales orders, invoices, and credit memos. The information in the report is in the same format as on the declaration form from the customs and tax authorities.  

For the VAT return, you can specify the entries to include:

* Submit open transactions only, or open and closed. For example, this is useful when you prepare your final annual VAT return.
* Submit only entries from the specified periods, or also include entries from previous periods. This is useful for updating a VAT return that you have already submitted, for example, if a vendor sends you a late invoice.    

## To connect to your tax authority's web service
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides service connections to tax authority websites. For example, if you are in the UK, you can enable the **GovTalk** service connection to submit the EC Sales List and VAT Return reports electronically. If you want to submit the report manually, for example by entering your data on the tax authority's website, this isn't required.   

To report VAT to a tax authority electronically, you need to connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to the tax authority's web service. This requires that you set up an account with your tax authority. When you have an account, you can enable a service connection that we provide in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Connections**, and then choose appropriate link.
2. Fill in the required fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > It is a good idea to test your connection. To do this, choose the **Test Mode** check box, then prepare and submit your VAT report as described in the [To prepare and submit a VAT report](#to-prepare-and-submit-a-vat-report) section. While in Test Mode, the service tests whether the tax authority can receive your report, and the status of the report will indicate whether the test submission was successful. It is important to remember that this is not an actual submission. To submit the report for real, you must clear the **Test Mode** check box, and then repeat the submission process.

## To set up VAT reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

[!INCLUDE [vat-report-setup](includes/vat-report-setup.md)]

### To set up VAT return periods

Optionally, if your business isn't located in the UK, use the **VAT Returns Periods** page to set up scheduled VAT returns. If your business is located in the UK, see [Making Tax Digital in the United Kingdom](LocalFunctionality/UnitedKingdom/making-tax-digital-submit-vat-return.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Return Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **VAT Return Periods** page, fill in the fields to set up the first period. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].  
3. Repeat step 2 for any additional periods that you want to add.  

Now, when the time has come to submit a VAT report for a VAT return period, choose the period in  the **VAT Return Periods** page, and then choose the **Create VAR Return** action. Then, in the **VAT Return** card, choose the **Suggest Lines** action as described in step 3 in the following procedure.  

## To prepare and submit a VAT report

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **EC Sales List** or **VAT Returns**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose **New**, and then fill in the required fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To generate the content of the report, choose the **Suggest Lines** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  For the EC Sales List report, you can review the transactions included in the report lines before you submit the report. To do that, choose the line, and then choose the **Show VAT Entries** action.  

4. To validate and prepare the report for submission, choose the **Release** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] validates whether the report is set up correctly. If the validation fails, the errors display under **Errors and Warnings** so that you know what to fix. Typically, if the message is about a missing setting in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can click the message to open the page that contains the information to correct.  
5. To submit the report, choose the **Submit** action.  

After you submit the report, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] monitors the service and keeps a record of your communications. The **Status** field indicates where the report is in the process. For example, when the authorities process your report, the status of the report changes to **Succeeded**. If the tax authority found mistakes in the report you submitted, the status of the report will be **Failed**. You can view the errors under **Errors and Warnings**, correct them, and then submit the report again. To view a list of all your EC Sales List reports, go to the **EC Sales List Reports** page.  

### VAT return statuses

VAT returns can have different statuses, as described in the following table.

| Status | Description |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Open | When you create a new VAT return. You can run the **Suggest Lines** action. If you need to correct values, you can run the **Suggest Lines** action again. You can't submit a VAT return that has this status. |
| Released | Status will be changed when you use the **Release** action. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will show the **Errors and Warnings** FastTab. You can't make changes or use the **Suggest Lines** action. To make changes, you must reopen the VAT return. |
| Rejected | If your submission wasn't successful (for example, if authentication failed), the status will change to **Rejected**. You can't reopen a VAT Return that has this status. |
| Submitted | The VAT return is submitted using the **Submit** action, or it's marked as submitted by using the **Mark as Submitted** action. |
| Accepted | The VAT return has this status if the report is marked as accepted by using the **Mark as Accepted** action. If the **VAT Return** report is marked as **Accepted**, you can run the **Calculate and Post VAT Settlement** action. |

## Viewing communications with your tax authority

In some countries/regions, you exchange messages with the tax authority when you submit reports. You can view the first and the last message you sent or received by choosing the **Download Submission Message** and **Download Response Message** actions.  

## Submitting VAT reports manually
If you use another method to submit the report, for example by exporting the XML and uploading it to a tax authority website, afterward you can choose **Mark as Submitted** to close the reporting period. When you mark the report as released, it becomes non-editable. If you must change the report after you mark it as released, you must reopen it.

## VAT settlement
Periodically, you must remit the net VAT to the tax authorities. If you need to settle VAT frequently, you can run the **Calc. and Post VAT Settlement** batch job to close the open VAT entries and transfer purchase and sales VAT amounts to the VAT settlement account.

When you transfer VAT amounts to the settlement account, the purchase VAT account is credited, and the sales VAT account is debited with the amounts calculated for the specified period. The net amount is credited or debited, if the purchase VAT amount is larger, to the VAT settlement account. You can post the settlement immediately or print a test report first.  

> [!Note]
> When you use the **Calc. and Post VAT Settlement** batch job, if you do not specify a **VAT Bus. Posting Group** and a **VAT Prod. Posting group**, entries with all business posting groups and product posting group codes are included.

## Configuring your own VAT reports

You can use the **EC Sales List** report out-of-the-box. However, you can also create your own reports, if you have a development license so that you can create codeunits. If you need assistance, contact a Microsoft Partner.  

The following table describes the codeunits that you must create for your report.  

| Codeunit | What it must do |
|----|-----|
|Suggest Lines| Fetch information from the **VAT Entries** table, and display it in lines on the VAT report.|
|Content | Control the format of the report. For example, whether it's XML or JSON. The format to use depends on the requirements of your tax authority's web service. |
|Submission | Control how, and when, you submit the report based on the requirements of your tax authority. |
|Response Handler | Handle the return from the tax authority. For example, it might send an email message to your company's contact person. |
|Cancel | Send a cancellation of a VAT report that was submitted earlier to your tax authority. |  

> [!Note]
> When you create codeunits for the report, pay attention to the value in the **VAT Report Version** field. This field must reflect the version of the report that is, or was, required by the tax authority. For example, you might enter **2021** in the field to indicate that the report conforms to the requirements that were in place that year. To find the current version, contact your tax authority.

# Purchases by Location (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Purchases by Location** report provides an overview of purchasing activities for each warehouse location. It helps you find out which item categories and items are most frequently purchased in each location, and how much money you're spending on the purchases.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-by-location.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases by Location Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-by-location.png":::

## Use the report

The report is especially useful for purchasing managers and purchasers.

Purchasing managers can use the report to analyze purchasing trends across different warehouse locations. For example, you can use the report to find the most frequently bought items and item categories in each warehouse. You and the warehousing team can gain insights into warehouses with consistently high or low purchasing activities.

Purchasers can use this report to monitor purchasing activities across warehouse locations. For example, you can find item categories and items with low quantities that require attention to prevent stock-outs or disruptions in production. Use this information to plan ahead and work with your team to ensure that you meet purchase demand across locations.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Purchases by Location* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)
- [**Purchase Quantity**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-quantity)
- [**% GT Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#-gt-purchase-amount)
- [**% GT Purchase Quantity**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#-gt-purchase-quantity)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

# Insure fixed assets

Use the **Insurance Card** page to set up an insurance policy to cover one or more fixed assets. You can assign one fixed asset to one insurance policy, or multiple fixed assets to one insurance policy.

You assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy by posting to the insurance coverage ledger from the **Insurance Journal** page.

In addition, you can assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy and create coverage ledger entries when you post its acquisition cost. You post an acquisition cost from the fixed asset journal with the **Insurance No.** field filled in. You must turn on the **Automatic Insurance Posting** toggle on the **Fixed Asset Setup** page. For more information, see [Acquire a fixed asset by using a fixed asset G/L journal](fa-how-acquire.md#acquire-a-fixed-asset-by-using-a-fixed-asset-gl-journal).

If the **Automatic Insurance Posting** toggle on the **Fixed Asset Setup** page isn't turned on, posting acquisitions from the fixed asset journal creates lines on the **Insurance Journal** page. You must post those lines manually.

> [!WARNING]  
> If you don't turn on the **Automatic Insurance Posting** toggle on the **Fixed Asset Setup** page, your insurance journal should be based on a journal template without a number series. This is because the inserted document numbers from the fixed asset journal line will otherwise conflict with the number series of the insurance journal. For more information about journal templates and batches, see [Set Up General Fixed Assets Information](fa-how-setup-general.md).

After you assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy, the **Insured** field on the fixed asset card contains **Yes**. When you sell the fixed asset, the toggle is automatically turned off.

## To create or modify an insurance card

When you receive information about changes in the coverage amount, you must enter the new information on the **Insurance Card** page to ensure that you analyze insurance policy coverage correctly.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new card for an insurance policy. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Alternatively, select the insurance policy that you want to change, and then choose the **Edit** action.

## To assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy by posting from the insurance journal

You assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy by posting to the insurance coverage ledger.  

The following procedure explains how to create an insurance journal line manually. If the **Automatic Insurance Posting** toggle is turned on the **Fixed Asset Setup** page, insurance journal lines are automatically created when you post acquisition costs. In that case, all you have to do is to post the journal.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant journal, and fill in the journal lines as necessary.  
3. To assign multiple fixed assets to one insurance policy, create journal lines with the same value in the **Insurance No.** field and different values in the **FA No.** field.  
4. Choose the **Post** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The entries from an insurance journal are only posted to the insurance coverage ledger.  

## To update the insurance value of a fixed asset

You can use the **Index Insurance** batch job to update the value of the fixed assets that are covered.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Index Insurance**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   In the **Index Figure** field, you enter a decrease of 5%, for example, as 95, whereas you enter an increase of 2% as 102.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

   The batch job calculates the new amount as a percentage of the total value insured, as stated on the **Insurance Statistics** page, and then creates a line in the insurance journal.  
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Open the relevant insurance journal, review the created values, and then post them to the insurance coverage ledger.  

## To monitor insurance coverage

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides dedicated reports and statistics pages for use in analyzing insurance policies and whether your fixed assets are over- or under-insured.  

To learn more about the built-in reports for fixed assets insurance, go to [Fixed assets insurance reports](fa-reports.md#fixed-assets-insurance-reports).

### Overview of insurance policies

To get an overview of your insurance policies, use the [Insurance - List](reports/report-5621.md) report.

### Insurance coverage

To find out which insurance policies cover each asset, and by which amount, use the [Insurance - Tot. Value Insured](reports/report-5625.md) report.

#### Over/under coverage

You can check whether fixed assets are over- or under-insured in the following ways:  

* The **Insurance Statistics** page. A positive amount in the **Over/Under Insured** field means that the fixed asset is over-insured. A negative amount means that the asset is under-insured.  
* The **Fixed Asset Statistics** page. Choose the **Total Value Insured** field to view the **Ins. Coverage Ledger Entries** page.  
* The **Over/Under Coverage** report.  
* The [Insurance - Analysis](reports/report-5620.md) report.  


### Uninsured fixed assets

To check whether you forgot to assign a fixed asset to an insurance policy, use the [Insurance - Uninsured FAs](reports/report-5626.md) report. 


## To view insurance coverage ledger entries

You can view the entries that you made in the insurance coverage ledger.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant insurance policy, and then choose the **Coverage Ledger Entries** action.  


## To view the total insurance value of fixed assets

A matrix page shows the insurance values that are registered for each insurance policy for each fixed asset that result from posted insurance-related amounts.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant insurance policy, and then choose the **Total Value Insures per FA** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **Show Matrix** action.  
5. To see the underlying insurance coverage ledger entries, choose a value in the matrix.  

## To correct insurance coverage entries

If a fixed asset was assigned to the wrong insurance policy, you can correct it by creating two reclassification entries from the insurance journal.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create one journal line for the fixed asset and the correct insurance policy where the value in the **Amount** field is positive.  
3. Create another journal line for the fixed asset and the incorrect insurance policy where the value in the **Amount** field is negative.  
4. Choose the **Post** action.  

The fixed asset is removed from the incorrect insurance policy on the second line. The asset is assigned to the correct insurance policy on the first line of the journal.

# Set Up Shipment Methods

Shipment methods often depend on the items, the customers, and the vendors. For example, if the customer lives on an island, they can choose to have items always shipped by air or always by sea. Some customers may require next day delivery. Some may want to pick up the order. On the customer and vendor cards, you can specify what sort of delivery is desired.

You set up the description and code for each shipment method on the **Shipment Methods** page. For example, you can set up the code FOB, and enter Free on Board in the **Description** field. You can then enter the code in **Shipment Method Code** fields elsewhere in the system, such as on a customer card. Then when you create new orders, invoices, credit memos, and so on, the system will enter the description represented by the code. You can change it on the document as needed.

## To set up a shipment method

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shipment Methods**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Shipment Methods** page, choose the **New** action.
3. On the new line, specify a code and description for the shipment method.

> [!TIP]
> If you use Incoterms, set up shipment methods to represent the relevant Incoterms rules.

# Work with accounting periods and fiscal years

Accounting periods, also known as reporting periods, are periods of time for which a company or organization reports financial performance by generating, for example, their income statement or balance sheet. Typically, accounting periods refer to the company's fiscal year, which can contain several accounting periods, such as months or quarters.

For many companies the fiscal year doesn't align with the calendar year, for instance when the fiscal year ends on June 30 rather than December 31. For newly created companies, the fiscal year might even actually be longer than 12 months.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only requires accounting periods if you want to close an income statement, or run data compression tasks.

You can use accounting periods in reporting such as when you're reviewing posted entries on the **Balance/Budget** page where the reporting interval is specified. One of the options you might specify is to report by accounting period. You can also build a financial report that compares results for different accounting periods.

## Creating a new fiscal year

You can create accounting periods in bulk by using the **Create Fiscal Year** batch job, or by doing so manually.

### How to create accounting periods in bulk

Use the **Create Fiscal Year** batch job to divide a fiscal year into periods of equal length.  

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Accounting Periods**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Create Year** action.
3. In the **Starting Date** field, enter the date on which the fiscal year starts.  
4. In the **No. of Periods** field, enter the number of accounting periods to divide the fiscal year into. There can be up to 365 periods in a year.  
5. In the **Period Length** field, enter a duration for each period. Duration identifiers include 1M for one month, 1Q for one quarter, and 1Y for one year.  
6. Choose **OK**.  

### How to create accounting periods manually

If the accounting periods in your fiscal year have different durations, such as the 4-4-5 calendar used in retail, you can manually set it up.  
  
1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Accounting Periods**, then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Starting Date** field, enter the date on which the fiscal year starts. The **Name** field will show the name of the month.  
3. Choose the **New Fiscal Year** check box to indicate that this is the first period in the year. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use this period to determine which periods to close at year-end.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each remaining period.  

## Closing a fiscal year

Closing the fiscal year is one of the tasks for closing the books. After you close a fiscal year, the **Closed** and **Date Locked** check boxes are selected for all periods in the year. You can't reopen a year or clear the check boxes.

> [!NOTE]  
> You must always have at least one open fiscal year. When closing a year, ensure that a new year has been created. Also, note that after you close one year, you cannot change the starting date of the following year.

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Accounting Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Close Year** action.  

## Posting entries to a closed fiscal year

Although a fiscal year is closed, you can still post general ledger entries to it. When you do, the entries are marked as posted to a closed fiscal year and the **Prior Year Entry** check box is selected. By default, the check box isn't displayed on the page, but you can add it. The next steps are to close the income statement accounts and transfer the year's results to an account in the balance sheet. Repeat these steps each time you post entries to a closed fiscal year.

# Troubleshooting Self-Service Sign-Up
Signing up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is easy and can be done very quickly. You can create a free account even if you are an existing organization. This article addresses issues that you may have during signup.

## What email address can I use with Business Central?
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] requires that you use a work, or school, email address to sign up. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does not support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunication providers. This includes outlook.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com, and others.

If you try to sign up with a personal email address, you will get a message indicating to use a work or school email address.

## Troubleshooting
In many cases, registering for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can be achieved by following the sign-up process. However, there are several reasons why you may not be able to complete self-service signup. The table below summarizes some of the most common reasons you may not be able to complete signup and ways you can workaround these issues.

| Symptom/Error Message | Cause and Workaround |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| For Microsoft 365 email addresses that are not registered in a supported country, you receive a message like the following during signup:<br /><br />**That didn't work, we don't support your country or region yet.** |[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] currently only supports Microsoft 365 email accounts that are registered in a limited number of markets. For more information, see [Regional Availability](#regional-availability). |
| Personal email addresses such as nancy@gmail.com are not supported. You receive a message like the following during signup:<br /><br />**You entered a personal email address: Please enter your work email address so we can securely store your company's data.**<br> or <br> **That looks like a personal email address. Enter your work address so we can connect you with others in your company. And don’t worry. We won’t share your address with anyone.** |[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does not support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunications providers. To complete signup, try again using an email address assigned by your work or school. If you still cannot sign up and are willing to complete a more advanced setup process, you can register for a new Microsoft 365 trial subscription and use that email address to sign up. |
| .gov or .mil email addresses You receive a message like the following during signup:<br /><br />**[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] unavailable: [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is not available for users with .gov or .mil email addresses at this time. Use another work email address or check back later.** <br>or <br>**We can't finish signing you up. It looks like [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] isn't currently available for your work or school.** |[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does not support .gov or .mil addresses at this time. |
| Self-service signup is not enabled. You receive a message like the following during signup:<br /><br />**We can't finish signing you up. Your IT department has turned off signup for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Contact them to complete signup.** <br>or <br> **That looks like a personal email address. Enter your work address so we can connect you with others in your company. And don’t worry. We won’t share your address with anyone.** |Your organization’s IT administrator has disabled self-service signup for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To complete signup, contact your IT administrator and ask them to follow the instructions on [this page](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-business-central-manage-selfservice-signups) to allow existing users to sign up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and to allow new users to join your existing tenant. You may also experience this problem if you signed up for Microsoft 365 through a partner. |
| Email address is not a Microsoft 365 ID. You receive a message like the following during signup:<br /><br />**We can't find you at contoso.com. Do you use a different ID at work or school? Try signing in with that, and if it doesn't work, contact your IT department.** |Your organization uses IDs to sign in to Microsoft 365 and other Microsoft services that are different than your email address. For example, your email address might be Nancy.Smith@contoso.com but your ID is nancys@contoso.com. To complete signup, use the ID that your organization has assigned to for signing in to Microsoft 365 or other Microsoft services. If you do not know what this is, contact your IT administrator. If you still cannot sign up and are able to complete a more advanced setup process, you can register for a new Microsoft 365 trial subscription and use that email address to sign up. |
| If your Microsoft 365 account is registered to a supported country, and you are signing up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] while in a different country, you receive a message like the following during signup:<br /><br />**That didn't work, we don't support your country or region yet.**| Your organization's Microsoft 365 subscription is registered to a specific country in the Microsoft 365 administration portal. The signup experience for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the language and locale that your current browser uses, and as a result, you can get the error message even though you are in a supported country. Ask your IT administrator to verify the country that is specified in the organization profile in the [Microsoft 365 administration portal](https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home#/companyprofile). You may have to use a different account for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|

# Apply payments automatically and reconciling bank accounts
You must regularly reconcile your bank, receivables, and payables accounts by applying payments recorded in the bank to their related open (unpaid) invoices and credit memos or other open entries in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

You can perform this task on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, for example, by importing a bank statement file or feed to quickly register the payments. Payments are applied to open customer or vendor ledger entries based on matches between payment text and entry information. You can review and change automatic applications before you post the journal. You can choose to close any open bank account ledger entries related to the applied ledger entries when you post the journal. The bank account is automatically reconciled when all payments are applied.

On the **Payment Application Rules** page, you can set up prioritized rules that govern how payment text is automatically matched with entry information.

You can also reconcile bank accounts without simultaneously applying payments. You perform this work on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page. For more information, see [Reconcile Bank Accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).

To import bank statements as a bank feed, you must first set up and enable the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feed service, and then link your bank accounts to the related online bank accounts. For more information, see [set up the Envestnet Yodlee bank feeds service](bank-how-setup-bank-statement-service.md).  

> [!TIP]
> You can also import bank statement files in comma or semicolon delimited format (.CSV). Use the **Set up a bank statement file format** assisted setup to define bank statement import formats and attach the format to a bank account. You can then use these formats when you import bank statements in the **Bank Account Reconciliation** page.

Alternatively, you can use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension to convert a bank statement file, from any format, to a data stream that you can import into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [use the AMC banking 365 fundamentals extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md).  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# How to use banking and payment formats in Business Central

Banking and payment formats can change over time and vary by country/region and bank. To help you connect to your bank and handle transactions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], Microsoft works with partners who provide apps that support different formats and integrations. 

In some countries/regions, Microsoft also provides built-in imports and export options. However, these options aren't adapted to newer versions of the formats, unless the bank requires it. Also, there will be no development of new banking and payment-related formats. This affects the country/region localizations of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that Microsoft releases. For a list of local versions, see [list of localizations here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). 

## Frequently Asked Questions about supported banking and payment formats

### Will [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] discontinue these import/export options and the current formats?  

No, there are no plans to remove the current formats and import/export options. You can still use them, and partners, and customers can still build integrations for them.  

### How can I find banking and payment apps for my country/region?

You can find ISV banking solutions that support banking and/or payment-related functionality on the **Banking Apps** page or on [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/)

Make sure to check the features of each app to see if they match your business needs and your bank requirements. 

> [!NOTE]
> There's one exception. The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds and AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals apps aren't impacted and still supported. 

### Is there no plan to support banking connectivity in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the future?  

Yes, Microsoft wants to enable you to connect to your bank and perform fundamental tasks in a modern and secure manner. This is why Microsoft supports partners who create apps for this purpose.

# Payment practices report  

Authorities in some country/regions require large companies to report their payment practices and performance regarding how quickly they pay their vendors. For example, each year Swedish companies with 250 or more employees must report to the Swedish Companies Registration Office the payment times they have for purchases from smaller companies. Similar acts exist in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. The legislation is intended to protect smaller businesses from bearing financial burdens that late payments cause.

> [!NOTE]
> Only some countries currently require this type of reporting. Because the requirements are largely the same, this is a global feature that all countries/regions can use.  

You can base the report on different sources, and can sort vendors based on their size or defined payment terms. Companies can provide reports for vendors for the following information, as required by local authorities:  

- The average agreed payment period.  
- The average actual payment term.
- The percentage of invoices they paid within the agreed payment period.

You can select the period for which to run a calculation and to find details based on a grouping that you choose. For each of these groupings, you can find sourced entries.

## Generate the report

To run the **Payment Practices** report, use the following steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that op the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Practices**, and then select the related link. 
2. Select **New**.
3. On the **General** FastTab, enter values in the following fields:

   | Field | Description |
   |---------|-----------------------------------|
   | No. | Specify the number of the entry or record for the report. |
   | Aggregation Type | Specify how data is aggregated. If you choose **Period**, the report is covers the period defined in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields. If you choose **Company Size**, the report is based on the number of employees in the vendor company. **Note:** To use the **Company Size** option, you must first create sizes in the **Company Sizes** page and assign them to the relevant vendors in the **Company Size Code** field on the **Vendor Card** page.  |
   | Header Type | Specifies the source for entries in the payment practice, and you can choose Vendors, Customers or both. |
   | Starting Date | Specifies the starting date of the payment practice. |
   | Ending Date | Specifies the ending date of the payment practice. |

4. After you fill in the fields in the header, use the **Generate** action to generate the report data.

When you generate the report, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fills in the **Generated On** and **Generated By** fields with the date and time it was generated and by whom, respectively.

## Edit the results

Based on the selection in the **Aggregation Type** field, you get different lines. You can change the values on the lines. If you do, the report is marked as **Modified Manually**.

## Review the calculations

To explore the calculations behind the values on the **Statistics** FastTab, choose the value in the field to open the **Payment Practice Data List** page.

## Print the report

To print the document, choose the **Print** action.

# Automate reminders in collections

Make your collections more effective by automating the process of creating, issuing, and sending reminders to your customers. Automation can significantly reduce the time you spend on collections, provide a better overview of the process, and give you full control over each step.

On the **Reminder Automation** page, you define the individual actions (steps). You can combine the steps to create, issue, and send reminders, or you can create a separate automation for each step if that's better for your collection processes. Automations are based on reminder terms and reminder levels. To learn more, go to [Set Up Reminder Terms and Levels](finance-setup-reminders.md). You can set filters for reminder terms for an automation as a whole, and set filters for each action in the automation. You can also attach outstanding invoices to emails as PDF files.

Automation happens through a job queue entry. When you set up an automation, use the **Cadence** field to specify how and when it runs. If you choose **Manual**, the automation runs one time when you use the **Start** action. You can also choose **Weekly**, **Monthly**, or choose **Custom** to set up a more detailed cadence. If you choose **Custom**, you must enter a date formula. To learn more about entering a date formula, go to [Use Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas). When you choose an option other than **Manual**, the automation runs until you pause it to put it on hold. If you want to be even more specific about when it runs, use the **Job queue entries** action to open the **Job Queue Entries** page and adjust the recurrence, for example to daily or a specific weekday.

## Automate the reminders flow

The following sections describe how to set up reminders to create, issue, and send automatically.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Reminders Automation**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose **New**, and then fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab.
1. In the **Reminder Terms Filter** field, choose the reminder term or terms to use this automation for.
1. In the **Cadence** field, choose how often the automation runs.
1. On the **Actions** FastTab, choose **New**, and then choose whether the automation creates, issues, or sends reminders. Choose **OK**.
1. Depending on the type of action the automation performs, fill in the fields as necessary on the setup page. To learn more about the settings, go to [Settings for reminder actions](#settings-for-reminder-actions).
1. After you set up the actions for the automation, you can use the **Move up** and **Move down** actions to adjust the order in which they run.

## Settings for reminder actions

The setup settings differ for the Create, Issue, and Send reminder actions. The following sections describe how to use them.

### Create

* Set the highest level on all reminder lines.  
* Create reminders for entries that are on hold. For example, this setting is useful if you're in an ongoing dispute with a customer and want them to see the big picture.
* Create reminders for all unpaid invoices, and not just invoices that are overdue. The report displays overdue invoices and invoices that are unpaid but not overdue in separate sections.
* Set filters to make the reminder more specific.

### Issue

When you issue a reminder, you create entries in the customer ledger that contain the posting date and tax date. Use the settings on the **Issue Reminders Setup** page to specify whether to replace that information on the issued reminder with the information from the created reminder. For example, if you created the reminder yesterday, and issue it today, the due date moves one day.

### Send

> [!NOTE]
> The Send automation requires that you've set up email in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about setting up email, go to [Set up email](admin-how-setup-email.md).

The content of the emails, such as attachment texts, email body texts, and language come from the setup for the reminder term. To learn more about email settings, go to [Set Up Reminder Terms and Levels](finance-setup-reminders.md).

Use the settings on the **Send Reminders Setup** page control the following:

* General settings, such as the description, and how many times you send the same reminder.
* Settings for what to include in the reminder.
* Settings for tracking the reminders you send by creating interactions, whether you print or send the reminder by email, and whether you want to attach overdue invoices only, all invoices, or no invoices. 

## Access the history of a reminder

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] keeps track of each time an automation runs. You can access the history by choosing the **Log entries** action. You can also use the **Issued Reminders** action to access a list of the reminders you've issued.

## Handle errors

On the **Actions** FastTab, for each action you can specify whether you want the automation to stop if the action has an error. If you do, the automation won't process the actions that come afterward. To turn this feature on or off, use the **Set stop on error** or **Clear stop on error** actions.

## Change action settings for an automation

You can change settings for an automation at any time. On the **Actions** FastTab, choose **Setup**, and then make your changes.

# Bookmark a page or report on your role center

Using the bookmark icon, you can add an action that opens a page or report from the navigation menu of your role center. Bookmarks allow you to quickly reach your favorite content or business tasks. You add the bookmark from the target page or report, meaning the screen that you want the link on the role center to open.

The bookmark icon is shown in the top-right corner of a page and also in the **Tell Me** window where you can efficiently bookmark multiple pages or reports. If a bookmark already exists for the page, then the icon is dark, and the tooltip says "Bookmarked".

## Bookmark the target page

1. Open any page that you want a link for on your role center.
2. Choose the ![Bookmark.](media/ui_bookmark_icon.png "Bookmark") icon.

An action named after the page is now added to the navigation menu on your role center.

## Bookmark the target report

1. Open any report request page that you want a link for on your role center.
2. Choose the ![Bookmark.](media/ui_bookmark_icon.png "Bookmark") icon.

An action named after the report is now added to the navigation menu on your role center.

## Bookmark a page or report from the Tell Me window

1. Open the **Tell Me** window and enter, for example, **Sales Orders**.
2. Hover over the search result for the **Sales Orders** page or report, and then choose the ![Bookmark.](media/ui_bookmark_icon.png "Bookmark") icon.

An action named after the page or report is now added to the navigation menu on your role center.

## Frequently asked questions  

### Can I reorganize my bookmarks?

Yes. You can personalize your role center and move actions into a more optimal sequence or move them into existing groups or subgroups.  
Learn how to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

### How do I remove a bookmark?

On the target page or report, choose the bookmark icon again to remove the involved action from your role center. You can also personalize your role center and temporarily hide actions without fully removing them.

### Where do I find my bookmarks?

When adding a bookmark to a page or report, the new action is added to the top navigation menu on your current home screen (role center). If you happen to have many actions, you may need to activate the **More** button to display all of them because the new action is always appended at the end of those actions.
<!-- Should we add a screenshot here? -->

### I don't have a bookmark icon. Is something wrong?

The ability to bookmark a page or report is one of many user personalization features in Business Central. If the bookmark icon isn't displayed, it's likely that your administrator has disabled personalization.

### Why can't I bookmark certain pages or reports?

Not all pages and reports can be bookmarked. When a page or report is run within some special context governed by the business application, the bookmark icon isn't displayed. For example, pages that cannot be found in the **Tell Me** window but are launched from elsewhere will not display a bookmark icon. Similarly, report request pages that are only used to collect filters without running the report will not display a bookmark icon.

  See technical details about [RunRequestPage](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods-auto/report/reportinstance-runrequestpage-method) and [FilterPageBuilder](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods-auto/filterpagebuilder/filterpagebuilder-data-type).

### When clearing my personalization, will my bookmarks also be cleared?

Yes. Bookmarks reside in the navigation menu. If you clear changes to the navigation menu from any page, or clear all personalization on the role center, all your new actions will be permanently removed.

### Why does the bookmark icon continue to indicate it's still not bookmarked?

When you add a bookmark, the new action is added to the navigation menu on the role center and subsequent visits to the page or report show a dark bookmark icon. If you personalize your role center and reorganize your actions by moving them into groups, the bookmark icon will no longer be dark and you can add another bookmark to that same page or report. This allows you to add multiple actions to the same page or report and categorize them into different groups.

### Why does my link to a report display a different report?

Some reports may be substituted by other reports after applying an extension to Business Central. When substitution occurs, the text of the new action isn't updated and will continue to display the name of the original report, but navigate to the newer report. To correct the text of the new action, you can remove the new action and add it again.
<!-- For more information on report substitution, see this link UNAVAILABLE AT THIS TIME -->

### Is bookmarking available for XMLports?

No. At this time, adding actions to open XMLports isn't possible from the user interface.

### Will my bookmarks be translated when I change my language in Business Central?

When you add a new action, any translated text that was available at the time is used when bookmarking. If new translated text is added later, then the new action will not include the newer translations.

### Why can't I add text in a page right after opening it with the bookmark?

When a page is bookmarked, the page will always open in the view mode from the bookmark&mdash;even if it was in the edit mode when it was bookmarked. Selecting the **Make changes on the page** icon ![Shows the pencil icon for editing the page.](media/edit-pencil.png) will let you add text in the fields that are editable.

# Manufacturing analytics

Businesses capture lots of data during daily activities that supports business intelligence (BI) for manufacturing, such as:

- Utilization
- Capacity
- Work center load
- Production time
- Production scrap

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's manufacturing data:

- Power BI reports for manufacturing
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using Open in Excel)
- Built-in manufacturing analytics tools
- Built-in manufacturing reports

Each feature has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of analysis you want to do and your role. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to gain insights into your manufacturing processes.

## Analytics needs in manufacturing

When you think about analytics in manufacturing, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes different needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use data in different ways. For example, people in manufacturing interact with data differently than people in finance.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role  | Data aggregation | Typical ways to consume data          | 
|------------------- |-------------------| ---------------------- |
| COO / CFO / CEO | Performance data  | KPIs, dashboards, financial reports               |
| Plant Manager     | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports, ad-hoc analysis      |
| Factory worker | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports, on-screen task data |

## Using Power BI to monitor key performance indicators in manufacturing

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. Businesses often use the following KPIs to monitor production performance:

- Capacity used (hours), either current or historical
- Utilization percentage, either current or historical
- Work center load percentage, allocated time (hours), or available capacity (hours)
- Cost amount variance or deviation percentage

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/finished-production-order-breakdown.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Finished Production Order Breakdown Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/finished-production-order-breakdown.png":::

These KPIs (and more) are available for manufacturing in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-manufacturing-app-name](includes/power-bi-manufacturing-app-name.md)] for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

To learn more, go to [Manufacturing KPIs](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md)

### Reports in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-manufacturing-app-name](includes/power-bi-manufacturing-app-name.md)]

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-manufacturing-app](includes/power-bi-manufacturing-app.md)]

To learn more, go to [Power BI Manufacturing app](manufacturing-powerbi-app.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of manufacturing data

Sometimes you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data Analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **Item Ledger Entries** or **Capacity Ledger Entries**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

> [!TIP]
> If you configure OneDrive for system features, the Excel workbook opens in your browser.

<!-- coming later
To learn more about how to do ad-hoc analysis on production data, go to [Ad hoc analysis of inventory data](ad-hoc-analysis-manufacturing.md). 
-->

## Built-in reports for manufacturing

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports to help manufacturing organizations report on their data.

[!INCLUDE [report-explorer-manufacturing](includes/report-explorer-manufacturing.md)]

To learn more about reports that are relevant for manufacturing, go to [Built-in production report overview](production-reports.md).

## On-screen manufacturing analytics

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you manufacturing overviews and tasks to do, such as:

- [View the load in work and machine centers](production-how-to-view-the-load-on-work-centers.md)  

## Print barcodes for finished goods on production orders

To remove a step or two from the process of tracking finished goods, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a **Print Label** action on the **Released Production Order** and **Finished Production Order** pages. The action prints a report that includes the **Item No.**, **Description**, **Unit of Measure**, and 1D and 2D barcode information from the orders. On the request page, you can also specify whether to print the **Lot No.**, **Serial No.** or **Package No.** values as barcodes.

> [!NOTE]
> Some printers and barcode/QR code formats require a specific implementation. You might need to upload a different Word template.
>
> Check with your equipment supplier to learn how to print Word documents on your device.
 If you decide to clone the report to create your own custom version, you can easily connect if you select **Prod. Output Item Label** on the **Report Selection Production Order** page.

# Put away production or assembly output

How you put away your output from production depends on how your warehouse is set up as a location. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

In a basic warehouse configuration for the inbound flow (put-away), on the **Location Card** page for the location, activate following settings:

* For production, in the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field, select **Inventory Put-away**.
* Assembly processes don't support inventory put-aways. You post an assembly order to register output. If you use bins, you can move items between the bins later. Learn more at [Move Items Ad Hoc in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-ad-hoc-in-basic-warehousing.md).  
* For projects, put-away isn't applicable.

In advanced warehouse configurations where a location requires put-away, create an internal put-away, a movement, or a warehouse put-away to put away the output.  

## Put away production output with an inventory put-away

The first step to put away output is to create the inbound warehouse request. This request informs the warehouse that the production or assembly order output is ready to be put away.

### To create the inbound warehouse request  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Released Production Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the production order that's ready for put-away, and then choose the **Create Inbound Whse. Request** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also create the inbound warehouse request by choosing the **Create Inbound Request** field when you refresh the production order. Learn more at [Refresh or Replan Production Orders](production-how-to-replan-refresh-production-orders.md).  

### To put away output with an inventory put-away  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Put-away**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new inventory put-away. Learn more at [Put Items Away with Inventory Put-aways](warehouse-how-to-put-items-away-with-inventory-put-aways.md).
3. To access the production order output, choose the **Get Source Documents** action, and then select the released production order.  
4. Fill in the put-away lines as needed.
5. When the lines are ready for posting, choose the **Post** action. Posting creates the warehouse entries and posts the output of the items.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-warehouse](includes/preview-posting-warehouse.md)]

You can also create an **Inventory Put-away** directly from the released production order. Learn more at [Put Items Away with Inventory Put-aways](warehouse-how-to-put-items-away-with-inventory-put-aways.md).  

When you post an inventory put-away, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assumes that all the operations are posted according to the standard routing. That is, the output quantity is posted according to the last operation. You can use the output journal to post variances in the output quantity and the setup and run times. If you must post partially after you created the inventory put-away, you can do so on set-up times and quantities for all operations except the last one. The inventory put-away controls the last operation.  

If you only need to post the set-up or run time on the last operation, set the output quantity on the last operation to 0. You can choose not to post the last line at all by deleting it.

## To put away assembly and production output in advanced warehouse configurations

When you post output for a production or assembly order in advanced warehouse configurations, the output goes to the bin defined in the production or assembly order. To learn more about different ways to move items in the warehouse with advanced configurations, go to [Move Items in Advanced Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-in-advanced-warehousing.md#to-move-items-with-the-warehouse-movement-worksheet).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't enter the number of the source document, such as the production order number, in internal put-away or movement documents for assembly or production output.  

You can also use warehouse put-aways for production outputs, which means you can use the same warehouse process for production outputs as you use for other receipts. Using the same process makes things easier because you don't have to switch between different types of document. Also, it's especially valuable for advanced configurations where Directed Put-Away and Pick is enabled because inventory put-away documents aren't available.

To use warehouse put-aways, on the **Location Card** page, in the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field, choose **Warehouse Put-away**.

> [!NOTE]
> For locations where Directed Put-away and Pick is enabled, make the field editable and allow the selection of **No warehouse handling** or **Warehouse put-away**. You can't select the **Inventory Put-away** option.
>
> You can't activate warehouse put-away if there are released production orders for the selected location.

When you post production output for a location where the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field is set to **Warehouse Put-away** on the **Location Card** page, the warehouse put-away document is either created automatically or you must use the **Warehouse Put-Away Worksheet** page.

If you delete a warehouse put-away, you can manually create a new one using the **Create warehouse put-away** action on the **Release Production Order** or **Finished Prod Order** pages.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't have production order lines with different locations with **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** set to **Warehouse Put-away**. To resolve this issue, use different production orders.
>
> You can't cancel output if there are outstanding or completed put-aways.

# Set up and export sales VAT advance notifications

A sales VAT advance notification is an XML file that you can use to report VAT to the German tax authorities on the Elektronische Steuererklärungen (ELSTER) online portal. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] generates an XML file with tax and base amounts, and information about your company in the format and layout that German tax authorities require.

> [!NOTE]
> Most of the functionality is included in the **ELSTER VAT Localization for Germany** extension. Make sure that this is installed in your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in [Customizing Business Central Online Using Extensions](../../ui-extensions.md).

## Process

To create valid sales VAT advance notification, you must set up the following information:  

- The company registration information and tax office information.  
- Basic sales VAT advance notification on the **Electronic VAT Decl. Setup** page.
- The VAT statement.  

### Set up company information

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Company Information** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   Specifically for sales VAT advance notifications, in the **VAT Representative** field, enter the contact person for VAT-related information.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

### Set up the electronic VAT declaration

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Electronic VAT Decl. Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----|
|**Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Nos.**|Choose the number series to assign identification numbers to new sales VAT advance notifications.|
|**Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Path**|Enter the path and name of the folder where you want to store the XML files.|
|**XML File Default Name**|Enter the name of the file.|

### Set up a VAT statement

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Statement**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **VAT Statement** page, in the **Name** field, choose the dropdown arrow.  
1. On the **VAT Statement Names** page, in the line for the appropriate VAT statement name, select the **Sales VAT Adv. Notification** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The VAT statement must have a VAT statement line for each key figure required by the tax authority, where the **Row No.** field contains the key figure and the **Amount Type** field specifies whether this is a base amount or a tax amount. Ask your tax office if you have questions concerning the key figures and their definition.

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

## Create an XML document

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Vat Advanced Notification List**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Sales Vat Advanced Notification List** page, choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!CAUTION]
    > If you submitted a sales VAT advance notification as a test notification by selecting the **Testversion** field, you can't change it into a real notification later. The tax authority doesn't accept the same XML file if it's submitted with the **Testversion** field cleared.

    Optionally, choose the **Preview statement** action to see a VAT statement that shows the data that is in the XML that you submit to the ELSTER portal. This view shows an amount for each element in the XML file in a human-readable format.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > In versions older than version 19.3 and other updates that are made available in January and February 2022, the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page shows fields and actions based on deprecated functionality in both the ELSTER portal and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. Specifically fields that are tied to stylesheets are no longer in use, because the ELSTER portal no longer provides such stylesheets.
1. Choose the **Create XML-File** action.
1. On the **Create XML - VAT Adv. Notif.** page, in the **XML-File** field, choose either the **Create** or the **Create and Export** option.  

    If you choose the **Create and Export** option, the XML file is generated and saved to your device. If you choose the **Create** option, data is generated in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] as an XML file when you choose the **Export** action on the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

After the sales VAT advance notification document is created, all fields in the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page can no longer be modified, except the **Description** field, because they define the content of the XML document. If you created an XML document and want to create a new XML document for the same period without transmitting the existing document to the tax authority, you must delete the existing XML file. Then, create the new document.

# Electronic invoicing in Germany

This article provides information on how to work with the German localization of the E-Document framework.

## E-Documents framework setup

Learn more in [Set up e-documents](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments.md), which provides information about setting up the E-Documents framework.

### Set up local formats  

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the E-Document framework for the German localization supports the XRechnung (UBL) and Peppol BIS 3 formats. The ZUGFeRD format isn't supported yet.

To set up the format for the E-Document service, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link. The **E-Document Services** page displays.
1. On the **General** FastTab, select **New**. In the **Document Format** field, choose **PEPPOL BIS 3.0** or **XRechnung**.  
1. Configure the fields as described in [Set up e-documents](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments.md).
1. Close the page.

### Using buying reference on the E-invoice

When you configure e-invoices in the sales process, make sure to display your buyer reference on the invoice. Follow these steps to set up how you use buyer references:  

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link. The **E-Document Services** page displays.
1. On the **Export** FastTab, select the **Buyer Reference Mandatory** field to specify whether the buyer reference is mandatory for the document.
1. Select where you use buyer references by choosing one of the options in the **Buyer Reference** field.  
   1. If you choose the **Your reference** option, you're required to populate the **Your reference** field on the sales document.
   1. If you choose the **Customer reference**, the system uses the **E-Invoice Routing No** from the **Customer** card.  
1. Close the page.

## Working with E-invoices

Learn more in [Use e-documents in the purchases process](../../finance-how-use-edocuments.md), which provides information about the E-Documents framework in purchase processes.

# Export and Print Intrastat Reports

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

Intrastat reporting is required throughout the European Union (EU) and must follow local requirements, such as specific formats and files. All companies in the EU must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. The movement of goods must be reported to the statistics authorities (Statistisches Bundesamt) every month, and a report must be delivered to the tax authorities.  

For Intrastat reporting, you must provide paper reports and files, which must be in ASCII format for Germany. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes reports and batch jobs that generate all of the information that must be sent to the German tax authorities. This information automatically includes both receipt and delivery of goods. The Intrastat file contains information from the lines in the **Intrastat** journal.  

## Deprecated Intrastat funcionality

This article provides details about the deprecated Intrastat Journals functionality. To learn more about the updated version of Intrastat, go to [Set up Intrastat reporting](../../finance-how-setup-report-intrastat.md).  

### To print the German Intrastat checklist  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  If you clear the **Show Intrastat Journal Lines** checkbox, the report displays only the information that must be reported to the tax authorities, and not the lines in the journal.  

5. Optionally, on the **Intrastat Jnl. Batch** FastTab, select the appropriate filters.  
6. Optionally, on the **Intrastat Jnl. Line** FastTab, select the appropriate filters.  
7. Choose the **Print** button to print the Intrastat checklist or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.  

### To print the German Intrastat form  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch name.  
3. Choose the **Form** action.  
4. Optionally, on the **Intrastat Jnl. Batch** FastTab, select the appropriate filters.  
5. Optionally, on the **Intrastat Jnl. Line** FastTab, select the appropriate filters.  
6. Choose the **Print** button to print the Intrastat checklist or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.  

### To export Intrastat information to a disk  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch name.  
3. Choose the **Make Diskette** action.  
4. On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Path** field, enter the full path and the name of the file to which you want to write the information.  

    Optionally, on the **Intrastat Jnl. Batch** FastTab, select the appropriate filters.  

5. To export the file, choose the **OK** button.  

The Intrastat information is exported, and you can either save the data to a file, or you can open the file in the appropriate program.  

When the file is exported, the **Reported** checkbox on the **Intrastat Jnl. Batches** page is selected, and the **Internal Ref. No.** field on every entry in the journal is filled in. You can manually change the contents of the field. For example, you can make changes when you need to run the report again. For more information, see Intrastat Jnl. Batch.

# Process for digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU)

You can export data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] according to the process for digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU), which is based on German tax law.  

## Overview  

Section 146 and 147 of the German Fiscal Code (Abgabenordnung, AO) allows tax authorities to assess the data of electronic accounting systems digitally. They may do this with a data storage device submitted to them or by direct or indirect access to the system. In the data storage device scenario, the tax liable company (or the person or entity entrusted with accounting and tax duties) must provide appropriate data storage devices with the data in computer-readable form. This means for the tax authorities that they'll be able to access at will all stored data, including the master data and connections with sort and filter functions. To provide data that can be used and evaluated in this manner, you must define and standardize the file formats for submission by data storage device.  

Tax authorities in Germany use analysis software, IDEA, which imports data from ASCII files. The IDEA software can import data in variable length or fixed length format. It requires an XML file, *index.xml*, that describes the structure of the data files.

## Defining GDPdU export data  

You can configure [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to export data to meet your needs. You can export large sets of data, and you can export small sets of data. You can export data from a single table or a table and related tables.  

For each data export, you define the tables and fields that you want to export. This depends on the auditor's requests. The selected information is exported to the ASCII files. A corresponding XML file, *INDEX.XML*, is also created to describe the ASCII file structure.  

The elements in the *INDEX.XML* file define the names of the tables and fields that are exported. Because the current auditing tool has restrictions on these field names, such as the length and the characters that are used, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] removes spaces and special characters and then truncates the names to match the 20 character limitation. You can change the suggested table and field names when you add fields to a table definition.  

In most cases, you set up GDPdU data export one time, and then a person in your company can run the export when the auditor requests new data. It's recommended that the setup is handled by people with an understanding of the database structure and the technical hardware in your company, but also in collaboration with people who understand the business data, such as the accountant.  

## Configuration  

You can set up different GDPdU data exports depending on the type of data that you want to be able to export. For example, you can create two GDPdU data exports:  

- One exports high-level information about all general ledger entries, customer ledger entries, vendor ledger entries, and VAT entries.  
- The other exports detailed information about the general ledger entries.  

> [!NOTE]  
> How to set up the GDPdU data exports depends on your company’s needs and the auditor’s requests.  

[Walkthrough: Exporting Data for a Digital Audit](walkthrough-exporting-data-for-a-digital-audit.md) provides an example of how to set up data exports for GDPdU.  

### Data export filters  

When you set up a data export, you can filter data on different levels as described in the following table.  

|Filter level|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Period filters**|You can specify a start date and end date for the data that is exported. You can then use this period filter to filter the data. For example, if you set a period filter for the export, you can then set table filters that use the period.|  
|**Table filters**|You can set filters on each table in the export. For example, you can include only open ledger entries, or entries that have a posting date in the specified filter. For example, you can also set a filter that is based on FlowFields, such as **Net Change (LCY)**, to only export customers where there's a change.<br><br>**Important:**  You can't set a table filter that is based on a FlowFilter.<br><br/> When you add table filters, you can increase performance by specifying the fields that the exported data will be sorted by the value of the **Key No.** field for the record definition. Which keys to use depends on the table. For example, if the table only has two key fields and relatively few entries, then the sort order doesn't affect the speed of the export. But for a table such as G/L Entry, the export is faster if you specify the key in advance, such as the `G/L Account No.,Posting Date` key. If you don't specify a key, then the primary key is used, which might not be the best choice.<br><br/>Other tables in which it can be useful to specify the key include the **Cust. Ledger Entry** and **Vendor Ledger Entry** tables.|  
|**FlowField filters**|You can include FlowFields in the export and set filters based on the period. For example, you can apply the period filter to the **Balance at Date** field on the **G/L Account** table.|  

If you include a FlowField such as the **Net Change (LCY)** field on the **Customer** table, you can specify that the entries must be filtered based on the remaining amount at the end date of the GDPdU period. If you add this as a field filter, then the calculation formulas are based on the dates that are specified during the export.

Learn more in [GDPdU Filter Examples](gdpdu-filter-examples.md).

## Export performance  

If you want to export large sets of data, it can take a long time. We recommend that you set up data exports based on advice from your tax advisor to establish your business needs, and the requirements of the tax auditor. The number of records in a table is also something that you should consider.

# Set up VAT reports in the German version

Information from various invoice types is used to feed data into the EU Sales List report. To file a VAT report under the ELMA5 system from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you need to set up report parameters.  

## Set up a VAT report  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Report Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **General** FastTab, select the **Modify Submitted Reports** checkbox to let users modify VAT reports that are submitted to the tax authorities.  

   If the field is left blank, users must create a corrective VAT report instead.  

1. Select the **Export Cancellation Lines** checkbox if you want to include information about cancellation lines when you export data for the VAT report of EU sales. Learn more in [Correct VAT Reports](how-to-correct-vat-reports.md).  
1. On the **Numbering** FastTab, specify the number series to be used for standard VAT reports. This will be the default numbering series that is used on any VAT Report that you then create.  

   Depending on the requirements, you can use the same number series for all VAT reports, or separate number series for each type of VAT report.

   For example, if your company uses separate number series for standard and corrective VAT reports, this number series is the default number series. Users can select a different number series in the **No.** field when they create corrective reports.  

1. On the **ZIVIT** FastTab, specify information for the fields.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Correct VAT reports in the German version

If you have to submit a corrective VAT report or delete a submitted VAT report, you must create a new VAT report. According to the legislation, a corrective report must be submitted within a month of the initial report.  

When you create a corrective report, the report contains two line types per corrected line. In one line type, **Cancellation**, the base value of the VAT is reported as a cancellation. All other information remains the same, and can't be edited. On a new line, **Correction type**, you can make corrections as needed to the VAT amount. The **Suggest Lines** action, however, suggests the correct amount based on the filters and posted documents. You can't correct or modify the **VAT Registration No.**, each period being corrected needs its own corrective report.  

The **Suggest Lines** action recalculates the values to report. The **Correct Lines** action is used to make manual changes. You can combine the effects of the two actions to correct your report.  

## Example corrections scenarios

1. If you post additional VAT entries after you submit the Standard report in the report period, choose **Suggest Lines** in the **Process** group to get the updated amounts.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you manually changed the amount for a customer or vendor, this amount is overwritten when additional VAT entries are posted. Update the amount accordingly.  

1. If you want to change the amount of a report line that is submitted and no new VAT entries are posted, choose the  **Correct Lines** action. On the **VAT Report Lines** page, select the lines that you want to correct, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    For each entry, two lines are displayed: **Cancellation** and **Correction**. You can now change the amount on the **Correction line**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **Correct Lines** action doesn't suggest the amount based in VAT entries. If you have new VAT entries for the customer or vendor, instead use the **Suggest Lines** action.  

1. If you used the wrong filters, for example, the wrong VAT product posting group, choose the **Suggest Lines** action, and then set filters as needed.  

    **Suggest Lines** creates entries to account for the difference between the filters.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the updated filters exclude a customer or vendor, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates a Cancellation line for the previous reported amount and a Correction entry with amount 0.

## Correct a VAT report  

1. Create a new VAT report. Learn more in [Create VAT Reports](how-to-create-vat-reports.md).  
1. Fill in the fields in the **General** FastTab, and set the **VAT Report Type** field to **Corrective**.  
1. In the **Original Report No.** field, select the report that you want to correct. You can only select reports of type **Standard** that are marked as **Submitted**.  
1. Create your correction VAT report line entries.  

    Choose the **Suggest Lines** action. Set filters as needed.  

    On each line, you can drill down on the amounts to see which VAT entries make up the amount. Change the amount if needed. You can't edit, however, the **VAT Registration No.**.  

1. If the **Suggest Lines** action doesn't provide suggestions to correct the amounts that you intended, use the **Correct Lines** action to insert cancellation and correction lines for the customer or vendor.  
1. Continue with the VAT report creation process, and release the report.

Depending on the volume of sales of goods or services to other EU countries/regions, you must submit monthly, bi-monthly, or quarterly declarations. If your company has sales of more than 100,000 euros per quarter, you must submit a monthly declaration. If your company has sales of less than 100,000 euros per quarter, you must submit a quarterly declaration. For more information, see the [BZSt website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=204368).  

The report is based on the VAT Entry table.

    |**Change to monthly reporting**|If selected, your company has sales of more than 100,000 euros per quarter and you must migrate from a quarterly report to a monthly report. **Important:**  Only select this field the first time that you submit a monthly report.|  
    |**Revoke monthly reporting**|If selected, you want to switch from monthly reporting to another reporting period.<br /><br /> For example, if you have previously submitted monthly declarations but the EU sales are less than 100,000 euros per quarter, select this field and then select one of the quarters in the **Reporting Period** field.|  

3.  On the **VAT Entry** FastTab, select the appropriate filters.

# EU sales list in Germany

In Germany, the German EU sales list is submitted to the "Bundeszentralamt für Steuern" (BZSt) through the BZSt Online Portal by using the ELMA5 interface.  

In order to increase security, all types of taxes and tax reports must be submitted under an authentication method. Beginning in January 1, 2013, it's mandatory that you make submissions with authentication. To do so, you sign in with your BZSt number and private key using your pass phrase on the ELMA5 communications server. ELMA5 is designed to handle the transmission of large datasets of more than 1000 records. Following successful login, you can upload the data transfer in an interactive way. You can also set up the transfer to be automatic.

    |**Table No.**|Select the number of the main table to export data from.<br><br/> When you enter a value in the **Table No.** field, the **Table Name** field is updated.|  
    |**Export Table Name**|Optional. An archive file with the necessary data is created, containing an *INDEX.XML* file. You can change the suggested name of the table to be used in the `INDEX.XML` file during the export. The default name is the name of the table without special characters due to the requirements of the auditors' tool.<br><br/> **Tip:** In most cases, the **Export Table Name** and **Export File Name** fields are based on the same value.<br><br/> There may be cases where you specify exporting the same table more than once. You can choose different Export Table Names for each table entry, and the Export File Name is automatically adjusted to match. You can then change the Export File Name as long as it's unique.<br><br/> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically names the files as follows.<br><br/> **Table Name:** G/L Account<br><br/> **Export Table Name**: GLAccount<br><br/> **Export File Name:** GLAccount.txt<br><br/> **Table Name:** G/L Account<br><br/> **Export Table Name:** GLAccount1<br><br/> **Export File Name:** GLAccount1.txt|  
    |**Period Field No.**|Specify a filter for which date field is used in setting the start date and end date of the report.<br><br/> For example, if you select the **G/L Entry** table as your data export source, you can select one of the date fields that are available in that table.|

    |**Date Filter Field No.**|Specify a date filter field if the table has one.<br><br/> If the table has more than one date filter, don't specify one in this field.|  
    |**Date Filter Handing**|Specify how the date filter is to be handled:<br><br/> - \<blank\>: No filter is set.<br><br/> - Period: Use the specified Start Date and End Date.<br><br/> - End Date Only: Use the batch job's End Date.<br><br/> - Start Date Only: Use the batch job's Start Date - 1.|  
    |**Export File Name**|Specify the name of the file that data from this table is exported to.<br><br/> For example, if the table is the **G/L Account** table, the value of the **Export Table Name** can be **GLAccount**, and the value of the **Export File Name** field can be **GLAccount.txt**.|  
    |**Key No.**|Optional. Specify the key field.|

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The INDEX.XML file contains table and field names in English based on the names of tables and fields. The names of tables and fields are defined in `<Name>` tags, and captions are defined in `<Description>` tags in the *INDEX.xml* file.
    > [!NOTE]  
    > Table and field names is written as-is, including any spaces, dots, parentheses, and so on. The only characters that are removed from the names are *&*, *'* (single quote), *"* (double quote), *<* (less-than sign), and *>* (greater-than sign).

    Next, you must specify the fields that data is exported from.  

1. In the **Fields** pane, choose the **Add** action.  
1. On the **Data Exp. Field List** page, select one or more fields that you want to export, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    1. To change the order of the fields, choose the **Move Up** or the **Move Down** action.  
    1. To remove a field from the list of selected fields, choose the **Delete** action.  

You added the main table from which to export. Optionally, you can add one or more related tables.  

## Add related tables to a data export source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, in the line below the line for the main table, add the related table.  
1. Choose the **Indent** action.  
1. Select the indented table, and then choose the **Relationships** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Table Relation** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**From Field No.**|Contains the number of the field in the parent table. You can specify that this field is related to a field in the subordinate table.|  
    |**To Field No.**|Contains the number of the field in the subordinate table. You can specify that a field in the parent table is related to this field.|  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **From Field Name** and the **To Field Name** fields are populated automatically.  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

After you added tables and fields, you must validate that the structure of the data export source is correct.  

## Validate the data export source  

On the **Data Exp. Record Source** page, choose the **Validate** action.  

This validates the list of fields against the keys for the tables. If you select a primary key after you select a secondary key, an error message displays, and you must change the order of the fields in the **Fields** pane.

# GoBD filter examples in the German version

This article provides examples of how you can use and combine different filter types when you set up your GoBD exports. Setting the right filters can improve system performance.  

The following examples use the **G/L Entry** and **Cust. Ledger Entry** tables for data. They assume that you specified the following dates in the **Export Business Data** batch job.  

- Start Date = 01/01/2013  
- End Date = 12/31/2013  

## Setting up export record source examples  

### Period Field No. field

The following table describes the setup on the **Data Export Record Source** page.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Period Field No.|Period Field Name|Table Filter|  
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|  
|**17**|G/L Entry|4|Posting Date|No filter set.|  
|**21**|Cust. Ledger Entry|4|Posting Date|No filter set.|  

Results of the export:

- G/L entries and customer ledger entries with posting dates between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  

### Table filter field

In this example, in addition to the **Period Field No.** information, you also specify a table filter. This filter is useful when you want to include other filters to specify more criteria, for example, amounts, in addition to starting and ending dates for your export.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Period Field No.|Period Field Name|Table Filter|  
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|  
|**17**|G/L Entry|4|Posting Date||  
|**21**|Cust. Ledger Entry|||Cust. Ledger Entry: **Posting Date=..31-12-13**|  

Results of the export:

- G/L entries with posting dates between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  
- Customer ledger entries with posting dates that are earlier than 01/01/2014.  

### Date Filter Field No. and Date Filter handling fields

The following example shows how to set date type **FlowFilters**. If a table has more than one date FlowFilter, you can't specify the one to use. However, you can specify how to handle the date filter.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Period Field No.|Period Field Name|Table Filter|Date Filter Handling|  
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------------------|  
|**18**|Customer|||Customer: **Net Change (LCY)**=<>0|**Period**|  
|**21**|Cust. Ledger Entry|4|Posting Date|Cust. Ledger Entry: **Remaining Amt. (LCY)**=<>0|**End Date Only**|  

Results of the export:

- Customers that have a **Net Change (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** in the period from 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  
- Customer ledger entries with posting dates between 01/01/2013 and 12/31/2013 that have a **Remaining Amt. (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** on 12/31/2013.  

### Date filter handling for the same table

In this example, you set multiple filter definitions for the same table.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Table Filter|Date Filter Handling|  
|---------------|----------------|------------------|--------------------------|  
|**18**|Customer|Customer: **Net Change (LCY)**=<>0|**Period**|  
|**18**|Customer|Customer: **Net Change (LCY)**=<>0|**Start Date Only**|  

Results of the export:

- Customers that have a **Net Change (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** in the period from 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  
- Customers that have a **Net Change (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** on the day before the start date.

# Walkthrough: Exporting data for a digital audit in the German version

You can export business data for auditing purposes. How the data export is set up is different for all companies, and you should ask your tax advisor and the tax auditor. The following walkthrough describes the end-to-end process, but it's an example only.  

The sample implementation illustrates a scenario where the auditor requests that you export data from your general ledger, and information about your customers and vendors. This isn't an example that is based on actual requirements from a tax auditor, but it serves to illustrate how to export data for a digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU) in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].  

## About this walkthrough

This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

- Setting up requirements for the data export.  
- Setting up the source for the data export.  
- Exporting data for the tax auditor.  

## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you need:  

- The German version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] with the CRONUS AG demonstration company.
- The *.DTD* file that is required according to the GDPdU. In this scenario, **gdpdu-01-08-2002.dtd**.  

## Story

Cassie, an accountant at CRONUS AG is notified by the company's tax auditor that they want to see a list of purchase and sales transactions in the first quarter of the calendar year 2013. Cassie knows the type of financial data that the auditor wants, but needs the help of Sean to set up the export.  

Sean is a power user with CRONUS AG and understands how the data is set up technically with tables and fields. Therefore, Sean usually helps Cassie set up the data exports for the auditors. From other data exports, Sean knows that the tool that the auditors use has some requirements on what the exported files must contain, but needs the help of Cassie to establish exactly which data is needed.  

## Defining the requirements

Cassie sets up the requirements for the data export. The auditors ask for transactions with customers and vendors. Therefore, Cassie knows that data is needed from the customer ledger, the vendor ledger, and the general ledger.  

### Set up the requirements for a data export  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Export**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Data Exports** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|The unique code for the data export, **AUDIT-Q113**.|  
    |**Description**|The description for the data export, **Data export for Q1 of CY 2013**.|  

    The **AUDIT-Q113** code is a container for the data export.  

    Next, Cassie adds descriptions of the kind of data needed in the export.  

1. On the **Data Exports** page, choose the **Record Definitions** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the **Record Code** field, and then, on the page that appears, choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Types** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|The code for the record type, **GLCUSTVEND**.|  
    |**Description**|The description for the record type, **G/L, Cust., Vend.**.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Record Code**|Select the record code, **GLCUSTVEND**.|  
    |**Description**|The description for the record type is added automatically, but you can change this to **General ledger, customers and vendors**, for example.|  
    |**Export Path**|Specify the path where the exported files are stored.<br><br/> In this scenario, **C:Exports**.|  

    If the specified folder doesn't exist, choose the **Yes** button to create it.  

Next, Cassie specifies the source for the data that are exported. Cassie knows from previous exports that data is needed from the following tables:  

- **G/L Account**  
- **Customer**  
- **Vendor**  

### Specify requirements for the source for the data export  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the **Record Source** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, in the **Table No.** field, enter **15**.  

   The **Table Name** field is automatically updated with the name of the **G/L Account** table.  

1. In the **Notes** part, choose the link, and then enter the following text:  

    **I need entries that show the affected accounts, the posting date, the balance, and the net change.**  

1. Repeat the two previous steps to add tables 18, **Customer**, and 23, **Vendor** to the data export record source.  

    For these tables, Cassie asks for data about each customer and vendor and detailed information about each transaction based on the customer ledger and the vendor ledger. Cassie also asks for the net change at the start of the period, during the period, and after the period that the data export is for.  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

Cassie has described the kind of data needed, and requests Sean for help with setting up the data export.  

## Setting up the source for the data export

Cassie and Sean talked about the requirements. Cassie explained the comments made for the first three tables in the record sources. The next day, Sean can complete the setup for the data export source.  

First, Sean adds the required *.dtd* file to the data export record definition.  

### Add a .dtd file to a record definition  

1. On the **Data Exports** page, choose the **AUDIT-Q113** data export, and then choose the **Record Definitions** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the line where the **Data Export Record Type Code** field is set to **GLCUSTVEND**, and then choose the **Import** action.  
1. On the **Import** page, navigate to the location of the relevant DTD file, and then choose the **Open** button.  

Next, Sean adds the **G/L Entry** table to the source and then adds fields from that table, and the **G/L Account** table.  

### Add the G/L Entry table to the data export record source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the line where the **Data Export Record Type Code** field is set to **GLCUSTVEND**, and then choose the **Record Source** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line under the line for the **G/L Account** table, and then choose the **New** action.  
1. In the **Table No.** field, enter **17**.  

   The **Table Name** field is automatically updated with the name of the **G/L Entry** table.  

1. Choose the **Indent** action.  

   This indents the **G/L Entry** table under the **G/L Account** table. Next, Sean adds a table relationship between the two tables.  

1. Choose the **Relationships** action.  
1. On the **Data Exp. Table Relationship** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**From Field No.**|Contains the number of the field in the parent table. In this scenario, the **No.** field on the **G/L Account** table.|  
    |**To Field No.**|Contains the number of the field in the parent table. In this scenario, the **G/L Account No.** field on the **G/L Entry** table.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

### Add fields from the G/L Account and G/L Entry tables to the data export record source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line for the **G/L Account** table, and then choose the **Add** action.  
1. Choose the following fields, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    |Field number|Field name|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|  
    |**4**|**Account Type.**|  
    |**31**|**Balance at Date**|  
    |**32**|**Net Change**|  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line for the **G/L Entry** table, and then in the **Fields** pane, in the toolbar, choose the **Add** action.  
1. Choose the following fields, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    |Field number|Field name|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**4**|**Posting Date**|  
    |**5**|**Document Type**|  
    |**17**|**Amount**|  

Sean added the **Posting Date** field from the **G/L Entry** table because Cassie needs the data to be filtered based on the posting date. Now, Sean uses the field to specify the field on the **G/L Entry** table that uses to calculate the period for the data export.  

### Add a period filter to a table in a data export source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line for the **G/L Entry** table, and then choose the **Period Field No.** field.  
1. On the **Data Exp. Field List** page, choose the **Posting Date** field, and then choose the **OK** button.  

   The **Data Exp. Field List** page is filtered to show only the date fields.  

This means that when Cassie exports the data and specifies the start date and the end date for the period that the auditors want, the export includes entries where the **Posting Date** field is between the specified start date and end date.  

Next, Sean adds the **Customer** and **Vendor** tables.  

### Add the Customer table  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Table No.**|**18**|  
    |**Export Table Name**|**Customer**|  
    |**Export File Name**|**Customer.txt**|  

1. In the **Fields** pane, in the toolbar, choose the **Add** action.  
1. Choose the following fields, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    |Field number|Field name|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|  
    |**21**|**Customer Posting Group**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|  
    |**61**|**Net Change (LCY)**|  

1. Repeat the previous two steps to add the **Balance (LCY)** field again.  
1. Choose the line for the first instance of the **Balance (LCY)** field, and then, in the **Datefilter Handling** field, choose **Startdate**.  
1. Choose the line for the second instance of the **Balance (LCY)** field, and then, in the **Datefilter Handling** field, choose **Enddate**.  
1. Choose the line for the **Net Change (LCY)** field, and then, in the **Datefilter Handling** field, choose **Startdate..Enddate**.

    > [!TIP]  
    > To change the order of the fields, select a field, and then choose the **Move Up** or the  **Move Down** action.  

Sean added the **Customer** table to the data export source. Now, he adds the **Vendor** table.  

### Add the Vendor table  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Table No.**|**23**|  
    |**Export Table Name**|**Vendor**|  
    |**Export File Name**|**Vendor.txt**|  

1. Follow the steps in the previous procedure to add fields from the **Vendor** table to the data export source.  

    The following table describes the field values for the fields in the **Vendor** table.  

    |**Field No.**|**Field Name**|**Field Class**|**Datefilter Handling**|**Export Field Name**|  
    |---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|**Normal**||**No**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|**Normal**||**Name**|  
    |**21**|**Vendor Posting Group**|**Normal**||**VendorPostingGroup**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Startdate**|**StartBalanceLCY**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Enddate**|**EndBalanceLCY**|  
    |**61**|**Net Change (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**Startdate..Enddate**|**NetChangeLCYPeriod**|  

Sean almost completes the setup, but wants to verify that the data export source meets the technical requirements of the auditors' tool.  

### Validate the data export source  

Choose the **Validate** action.  

Sean now completes the setup of the data export based on the requirements from Cassie. Sean notifies Cassie to start exporting data for the tax auditors.  

## Exporting data for the tax auditors

Cassie wants to export data that can be sent to the tax auditors.  

### Export data  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Export Business Data**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Export Business Data** page, on the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Starting Date**|The start date. In this scenario, **01-01-2018**.|  
    |**Ending Date**|The end date. In this scenario, **03-31-2018**.|  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definition** FastTab, select filters as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Data Export Code**|In this scenario, **AUDIT-Q113**.|  
    |**Data Exp. Rec. Type Code**|In this scenario, **GLCUSTVEND**.|  

1. To export the data, choose the **OK** button.  

When the export is completed, Cassie is notified, and can now submit the exported files to the tax auditors. First, Cassie examines the files in the C:Exports folder on the computer. There's a file for each table, and the files have the names that Sean specified in the data export source. There's also an *INDEX.XML* file that describes the structure of the data export with the names of the tables and fields that Sean specified.  

## Next steps

When the tax auditors import Cassie's files into their software, they can read the data that was exported. If the auditors need a new version of the same data export, Cassie can run the export again.  

The next time the tax auditors request new data, Cassie, and Sean can collaborate to create a new data export.

# Currency exchange rates in the German version

At the end of the fiscal year, you must adjust currency exchange rates for payables and receivables so that they're valued correctly in the annual balance. The **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job supports different valuation methods in order to meet legal requirements in Germany.  

## Valuation methods

According to the Bilanz Modernisierungs Gesetz (BilMoG), payables and receivables are valued differently depending on the difference between the reference date and the due date. This is managed by the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job where you can specify which valuation method to use. If the due date is less than one year after the reference date, the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job must be run using the lowest value valuation method.  

The following table describes the valuation methods.  

|Valuation method|Description|  
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**BilMoG (Germany)**|Beginning in 2010, each ledger entry is adjusted as follows:<br><br/>- If the due date is less than one year after the reference date, payable/receivable transactions are valued at the actual exchange rate.<br><br/>- If the due date is more than one year after the reference date, payable/receivable transactions are valued at the lowest value, with the possibility of appreciation in value (Wertaufholung) up to the initial value. <br><br/>**Note:** Ledger entries must contain a due date. An entry that doesn't have a due date is treated as a long term liability.|  
|**Lowest value**|Exchange rates are adjusted by using the lowest value of the two exchange rates. Currency losses are always calculated and posted. Currency gains are only calculated and posted up to the original local currency value of the transaction.<br><br/> This ensures that receivables aren't valued above their original posting amounts, and that payables aren't valued below their original posting amounts.|  
|**Standard**|Exchange rates are adjusted according to standard valuation principles. Full unrealized gains and losses are calculated and posted. If the transaction is partially applied, only the remaining amount is included in the adjustment. Learn more in [Adjust Exchange Rates](#valuation-methods).|  

German companies must use the **BilMoG (Germany)** option when they run the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job. This ensures that each transaction is adjusted using the appropriate valuation method as required in Germany. This also enables two fields in the request page, where you can specify the two dates that must be used to calculate the adjustment. The following table describes the fields.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Valuation Reference Date**|Specifies the base date that is used to calculate which entries are short-term entries.|  
|**Short term liabilities until**|Specifies the date that separates short-term entries from long-term entries. Short-term entries have a due date that is before or on this date. The default value is the value of the **Valuation Reference Date** field plus one year.|

# Create VAT reports in the German version

You can configure different types of VAT reports based on requirements. Then, when you have to submit a VAT report, you can create it on the **VAT Report** page and then export it in electronic format that conforms to the ELMA5 format requirements.  

## Create a VAT report  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Report**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Fill in the fields in the **General** FastTab, including the fields that are described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No.**|Specify the report number.<br><br/>Depending on the type of report, and the configuration in your company, you can use the automatically generated number, select a different number series, or enter a different number manually.|  
    |**VAT Report Type**|Select the appropriate VAT report type. The default setting is  **Standard**. If the report is an update to an existing report, choose **Corrective**.|  
    |**Trade Type**|Specify the type of trade that the report is to describe. The default is **Sales**. Other options are **Purchases** or **Both**.|  
    |**Start Date**|Specify the start date of the report period.|  
    |**End Date**|Specify the end date of the report period.|  
    |**EU Goods/Services**|Specify whether the report applies to **Goods**, **Services**, or both. The default is **Both**.|  
    |**Report Period Type**|Specify the time period that the report applies to:<br>- Month<br>- Quarter<br>- Year<br>- Bi-Monthly|  
    |**Report Period No.**|Specify the number of the VAT period.|  
    |**Report Year**|Specify the year that the VAT report covers.|  
    |**Processing Date**|Specify the date that the VAT report is created.|  

1. Fill in the fields in the **Sign-off** FastTab, including the key fields that are described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Sign-off Place**|Specify the location where the VAT report was signed off.|  
    |**Sign-off Date**|Specify the date when the VAT report is signed off.|  
    |**Signed by Employee No.**|Specify the number of the employee who signed the VAT report from the lookup list.|  
    |**Created by Employee No.**|Specify the number of the employee who created the VAT report from the lookup list.|  

1. Import the VAT ledger entries that must be included in the VAT report.  
1. Choose the **Suggest Lines** action.  

This adds VAT entries to the page. For each line, in the **Amount** field, you can drill down to see the VAT ledger entries that are the source of the line.  

After you create the VAT report, you have to submit it to the tax authorities.  

## Submit a VAT report  

1. On the **VAT Report** page, choose the **Release** action.  
1. Confirm that you want to release the report.  

    [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] validates that the VAT report is set up correctly. If the validation fails, the errors are shown on the **VAT Report Error Log** page so that you can make the appropriate changes. For example, an error displays if you try to release a standard VAT report but you have not yet added any lines to the report.  

    When you mark a VAT report as released, it becomes non-editable. If you must change the report after marking it as released, you must first reopen it.  

1. Choose the **Export** action to create a VAT report of EU Sales List data in ELMA5 format. Save a copy of the report, which has the required name specified by ELMA5.  

   You can now submit the report to the tax authorities.  

1. Choose the **Mark as Submitted** action.

# Direct debit using domiciliation

A domiciliation is a financial agreement between you and your customers, allowing you to automatically collect the payments for customer's invoices through a preferred bank account. Domiciliation can only be processed for domestic customers with domestic bank accounts. Domiciliation in foreign currencies or involving foreign banks aren't supported.  

Direct debit domiciliation is useful for companies with many customers or subscribers, such as a utility company or a publishing company.  

Before you can start using electronic banking for domiciliation, you must enter certain basic information.  

- **Domiciliation number** - This is a unique code obtained from the bank which identifies the domiciliation agreement between you, your customer, and the bank. The contract contains details regarding payment frequency, bank account numbers, and amounts. When you send your payments to the bank, the bank uses the domiciliation number to identify all parties involved.  

- **Preferred bank account** - The preferred bank account is suggested as a default bank account on all domiciliation suggestions for that customer. If necessary, you can change the bank account before posting the domiciliation suggestions. Learn more in [Generate Domiciliation Suggestions](/dynamics365/business-central/LocalFunctionality/Belgium/direct-debit-using-domiciliation).  

## Set up domiciliation

Before you can use electronic banking for domiciliation, you must enter the customer's domiciliation number and preferred bank account.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You should use one bank account per customer for all domiciliation.  

### Set up process

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the customer, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
`. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |-----|-----------|  
    |**Domiciliation**|Enter the domiciliation number for the customer. This number is used when you create domiciliation for this customer.|  
    |**Preferred Bank Account**|Enter the preferred bank account for transactions with this customer. This account is used when you create a payment suggestion for this customer.|  

## Generate domiciliation suggestions

After setting up domiciliation, you can start generating domiciliation suggestions. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can create domiciliation suggestions for domestic customers only.  

### Process

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Domiciliation Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
1. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch, and then choose the **Suggest Domiciliations** action.

1. Choose the **OK** button to export the file.  
1. Choose an appropriate location from where you upload the file to your bank, and then choose **Save**.  
1. Choose the **Yes** button to automatically post the domiciliation journal lines.  

   If you didn't select the **Post General Journal Lines** checkbox, you must post the domiciliation manually in the general journal.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > After posting domiciliation in the general journal, delete the posted domiciliation on the **Domiciliation Journal** page. To do this, select all lines with status **Posted**, and then choose the **Delete** action.

# Create payment journal templates and batches in the Belgian version

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], payment suggestions are generated and posted in payment journals. The structure of the payment journal is similar to the structure of other journal types. However, the payment journal contains some fields that are specific for processing payments. Before you can start generating payment suggestions, you have to set up a payment journal template and a payment journal batch.  

You can assign a specific page and a test report to each journal template. This way, you can manage your domestic and international payments from this adjusted page. The specified *source code* is copied to all the journal lines that are created based on the journal template. The code is also copied to the entries when they're posted. This way, you can always see where an entry is posted from.

If you assign a bank account to the payment journal template, the bank account is inserted on all payment journal batches and payment journal lines that are created by using this template. By specifying a bank account for the journal template, you can reduce the time that is required for checking the payment suggestions.  

## Create a payment journal template  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Payment Journal Templates** page, fill in the fields.  

   [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If the **Page ID** and **Test Report ID** fields aren't shown, you must add them through personalization. The fields must be filled in before you continue. Learn more in [Personalize Your Workspace](../../ui-personalization-user.md).
1. Repeat step 2 for any additional templates.
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

You can create multiple journal batches under each journal template. Several journals, each with its own name, can display the same page. For example, this can be practical if every user must have a dedicated journal.

## Add payment journal batches to the journal template  

1. On the **Payment Journal Templates** page, choose the **Batches** action.  
1. On the **Paym. Journal Batch** page, fill in the fields.  

   [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!NOTE]
   > To have the journal name update numerically, include a number in the journal batch name. For example, the name KBC1 increments by one number with every posting to KBC2, KBC3, and so on.  

   Next, you can test the configuration. Learn more in [Test Electronic Payments](how-to-test-electronic-payments.md).

# Belgian VAT

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes Belgian extensions to the VAT reporting capabilities so that you can print VAT transaction details. You must send the following reports to the Belgian tax authorities:  

- **Monthly/Quarterly declaration**: Use this report to create monthly or quarterly VAT declarations, depending on your company revenue.  

- **VAT annual listing (on paper/disk)**: Use this report to annually report all amounts invoiced for both goods and services to all Belgian companies with a registered VAT number.  

- **EC sales list**: Use this report to report the sales of goods to other countries/regions in the European Union. Learn more in [About the EC Sales List Report](../../finance-how-report-vat.md#ecsaleslist).  

You're also required to provide a printed statement detailing the VAT transactions to the Belgian tax authorities.

## Nondeductible VAT

In Belgium, VAT can be fully or partially deductible. Expenses such as representation cost or purchases of cars are only partially deductible, and the transaction must specify how much of the VAT is nondeductible. For example, you create a general ledger account for fixed assets such as cars, and another account for representation cost. For each account, you specify how much of the reported VAT is nondeductible by setting the **Percentage Non deductible VAT** field. Then, when you post a transaction, the deductible VAT posts to the corresponding VAT account. The nondeductible VAT is added to the base amount and posted to the same account as a tangible or intangible asset.  

For fixed assets, the nondeductible VAT depreciates just like the base acquisition cost of the fixed asset. You must set up separate fixed asset posting groups for each percentage of nondeductible VAT. You must do so because each fixed asset posting group posts to a general ledger account where the **Percentage Non deductible VAT** field specifies how much VAT must post to the same account as the fixed asset.  

If you select the **Incl. Non Deductible VAT** field in a VAT statement line, nondeductible VAT is included in the VAT amount. The **Calc. and Post VAT Settlement** report adds the nondeductible part of that amount to the **Non Ded. VAT Amount** and **Non Ded. Source Curr. VAT Amt.** fields in the resulting VAT entries.  

## Multiple VAT numbers for customers

The feature for using multiple VAT registration numbers for customers, including adding different **VAT Registration Numbers**, **VAT Business Posting Groups**, and **General Business Posting Groups** for addresses in another country, are available in the Belgian localization. Learn more in [Multiple VAT registration numbers](../../finance-how-use-multiple-vat-registrations.md).

In addition to different **VAT Registration Numbers**, **VAT Business Posting Groups**, and **General Business Posting Groups**, businesses using the Belgian localization also need to work with the **Enterprise No.**. When you open the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** page, you can add the **Enterprise No.** for the customer if their address is in another country. After you enter this information, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] does the following things when you're working with sales documents:  

- If the customer is from Belgium and the ship-to address is in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** comes from the **Customer** card.
- If the customer is from Belgium and the ship-to address isn't in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** is removed.
- If the customer isn't from Belgium and the ship-to address is in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** comes from the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** page.
- If the customer isn't from Belgium and the ship-to address isn't in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** isn't available.  

> [!NOTE]
> If there's a change in the **Enterprise No.** in a sales document, it displays on the **Confirm Alternative Customer VAT Registration** dialog.

# Export payment files in the Belgian version

After printing a test report and correcting errors, you can export the payment journal lines to a payment file.  

A payment file contains either domestic, international, SEPA, or non-Euro SEPA payments. The file can be sent to a bank electronically. You can create only one file for each posting date and each currency code. When you export the payments to a file, an accompanying note is printed, which can also be sent to the bank.  

In the payment journal, the **Status** field on the exported lines is set to **Posted**.  

## Print a payment file  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter *Payment Journal*, and then choose the link to open the **EB Payment Journal** page.  
1. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch.  
1. In the **Export Protocol** field, select the export protocol.  

   Export protocols control which payment file is generated in the payment journal. You can have a mixture of export formats in a single batch, such as domestic, international, SEPA, or a combination of these. However, when exporting the payment lines to a file, you can use only one export format, or export protocol.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > By defining the export protocol, you also define the type of validation that is performed in the payment journal.
1. Enter the payment journal line information.

    1. Choose the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action.
    1. In the **Suggest Vendor Payments EB** page, set the relevant filters and options.

        This batch job processes open vendor ledger entries and creates a payment suggestion as lines in a payment journal. Open vendor ledger entries result from posting invoices and finance charge memos.

        Only the ledger entries of vendors where the **Suggest Payments** field is selected on their **Vendor** card are included in the batch job. The suggestions are registered in a payment journal. You must specify a last payment date that is used in the batch job.

        In addition, only vendor entries that aren't marked as **On Hold** in the **Vendor Ledger Entries** page are included in the batch job. You can also run the batch job so that it also includes payments for which you can obtain a discount.

        When you enter an available amount, the vendors are ordered by **Priority**.

        You can define what is included in the report by setting filters. To set additional fields on the tab, choose the field. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
    1. Delete or modify the lines as appropriate.
    1. If no bank account is indicated on the payment journal template, indicate a bank account to pay with on each line.
1. Choose the **Check Payment Lines** action.

    The **Export Check Error Logs** page displays any errors that exist. If there are errors, you must fix them before you can continue.

1. If there are no errors, choose the **Export Payment Lines** action.  

   The report that you specified in the relevant export protocol processes the payment lines and generates the file.

# Set up declaration types in the Belgian version

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], there are two types of declaration:  

- Simplified declaration  
- Extended declaration  

The type of declaration depends on the amount of shipped or received goods. To determine the type of declaration that you should use, visit the [National Bank of Belgium](https://aka.ms/BelgianNationalBank) website.  

When using the extended declaration, also, you need to set up an Incoterm in Intrastat Declaration for each shipping method. If you don't see the **Incoterm in Intrastat Decl.** field on the **Shipment Method** page, you might need to customize the page and add the field.

## Set up declaration types  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the **Simplified Intrastat Decl.** checkbox to set up a simplified declaration type. Clear this field to use extended declaration.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Make manual corrections to VAT in the Belgian version

You can make corrections to posted VAT entries without posting the correction into the VAT or general ledger entries. This is useful if you need to make a change to the total sales or purchases VAT amounts without changing the VAT base. For example, you can manually correct VAT if you receive an invoice from a vendor who has calculated VAT incorrectly.  

## Make manual corrections to VAT  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Statement Preview**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the line that needs to be corrected. You can make the VAT correction on both the **Row Totaling** and **VAT Entry Totaling** row **Type**.  
1. To make the correction, choose the **Correction Amount** field. The **Manual VAT Correction List** page opens.  
1. Choose the **Edit List** action. On the **Manual VAT Correction List** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Posting Date**|Enter the posting date of the VAT correction.|  
    |**Amount**|Enter the amount of the VAT correction. You must enter the correction amount, not the new amount. For example, if the amount is 1,000.00 and should be 1,200.00, enter 200.00.|  
    |**Additional-Currency Amount**|This field displays the amount of the VAT correction in the additional reporting currency.<br><br/> The field is automatically calculated, based on the contents of the **Amount** field and the current exchange rate.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  
1. Refresh the **VAT Statement Preview** page to see your corrections.  
1. To view a report related to the preview of the VAT information, choose one of the following actions:  

    |Action|Description|  
    |------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Detailed Report**|Opens the **VAT Statement** report. Learn more in VAT Statement.|  
    |**Form/Intervat Declaration**|Opens the **VAT – Form** report.<br><br/> The **Form/Intervat Declaration** report is based on the VAT Statement template that is defined in the general ledger setup. Therefore, it might export data that isn't the same as what is shown on the **VAT Statement Preview** page.|  
    |**Declaration Summary Report**|Opens the **VAT Statement Summary** report.|

# Limit the posting period in the Belgian version

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can limit the period by which posting is permitted on three different levels: **by company**, **by user**, and **by template**.  

Limiting posting periods can be useful when a company closes its sales journal at the end of each month. This keeps salespeople from registering sales documents from the previous month. At the same time, the purchase journal may stay open to register incoming purchase invoices from the previous month.  

When you post on the **General Journal Templates** page, the contents of the **Allow Posting From** field and **Allow Posting To** field are checked for a date interval. The date interval indicates when you can post to a journal template. If the field is blank, the **User Setup** page is checked for a date interval for the current user. If the **User Setup** page doesn't contain an interval, the **Allow Posting From** field and the **Allow Posting To** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page is checked for a date interval at the company level.  

## Limit posting periods by company  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. To specify the start of the period, choose the **Allow Posting From** field, and then enter the earliest date on which posting to the company is enabled.  
1. To specify the end of the period, choose the **Allow Posting To** field, and then enter the last date on which posting to the company is enabled.  

## Limit posting periods by user  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. To specify the start of the period, choose the **Allow Posting From** field, and then enter the earliest date on which the user can post to the company.  
1. To specify the end of the period, choose the **Allow Posting To** field, and then enter the last date the user will be able to post to the company.  

## Limit posting periods by template  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
1. To specify the start of the period, choose the **Allow Posting From** field, and then enter the earliest date on which the user can post to the company.  
1. To specify the end of the period, choose the **Allow Posting To** field, and then enter the last date the user will be able to post to the company.

# Set up non-deductible VAT in the Belgian version

You can calculate VAT amounts for specific types of expenses that can be partially declared as VAT. For example, on the **G/L Account Card** page, if you enter 75 in the **% Non-Deductible VAT** field, then 75 percent of the regular VAT amount is considered an additional cost and is added to the net amount during posting. The remaining 25 percent is posted as regular VAT.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If no value is entered in the **% Non-Deductible VAT** field, the VAT amount is 100 percent deductible.  

## Set up the non-deductible VAT percentage  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select a general ledger expense account that requires the partial deduction, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
1. Enter the amount in **% Non deductible VAT** field.

# Belgian Intrastat reporting

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

Companies in the European Union (EU) are required to report trade with other countries/regions in the EU. This reporting process is through Intrastat reporting or VIES (VAT Information Exchange System). There are two types of Intrastat declarations:  

- Simplified declaration  
- Extended declaration  

To determine the type of declaration that you should use, visit the [National Bank of Belgium](https://aka.ms/BelgianNationalBank) website.  

## Submitting the Intrastat report

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can export the Intrastat declarations to a file that you can then submit to the OneGate portal. Learn more in [Export Intrastat Third-Party Declarations](how-to-export-intrastat-third-party-declararations.md).

# Set up vendors for automatic payment suggestions in the Belgian version

You can set up each vendor so that unpaid invoices from that vendor are automatically included in payment suggestions. For each vendor, you must decide whether you want to automatically generate payment suggestions. If you don't want to generate payment suggestions for a vendor, you shouldn't select the **Suggest Payments** checkbox. This way the outstanding ledger entries for the vendor aren't included in payment suggestions.  

## Set up a vendor to be included in the payment suggestion batch  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Vendors** page, select a relevant vendor, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
1. Select the **Suggest Payments** checkbox.  

   If this field isn't selected, no payment suggestions are generated for the vendor.  

1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Make journal templates mandatory in the Belgian version

You can use journals to post purchase and sales documents and make other general ledger entries. Journal templates can then help you structure different types of entries. In the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify if journal templates are required in the current company.  

## Make journal templates required in a company

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **General** FastTab, select the **Journal Template Name Mandatory** field. This field specifies if users must specify a journal template when they post general ledger transactions.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the **Journal Template Name Mandatory** field isn't selected, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't use template names in the posted documents and entries.

## Use journal templates in sales and purchase documents

If your organization decides to switch on the **Journal Template Name Mandatory** field, you must configure which journal templates must be used as default in sales and purchase documents.

> [!TIP]  
> Before you post a transaction, you can change the suggested template name in the **Journal Template Name** field. This way, the transactions are assigned another document number, as defined by the template.

### Use journal templates in sales documents

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Journal Templates** FastTab, choose the journal templates you want to use as default for all sales documents.  

### Use journal templates in purchase documents

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Journal Templates** FastTab, choose the journal templates you want to use as default for all purchase documents.

# Enterprise numbers and branch numbers in the Belgian version

Companies receive a unique enterprise number and one or more branch numbers from the Belgian [Crossroads Bank for Enterprises](https://crossroadsbankenterprises.com/). These numbers are used in all correspondence to simplify communication with the Belgian administrative and legal authorities.  

## Enterprise numbers

The enterprise number replaces the existing VAT number. For existing companies with a VAT registration number, the enterprise number is set as the VAT registration number preceded by a leading zero. New companies receive a new enterprise number.  

The enterprise number is printed on the following documents:  

- Outgoing sales and purchase documents  
- Financial statements  
- Reminders and finance charge memos  
- Intrastat forms and files  

The enterprise number is set up in the following locations:  

- Company Information table  
- Contact card  
- Customer table  
- Vendor table  

## Branch numbers

A branch number is given to a company to identify an address where at least one of the company’s activities is exercised, for example, a workshop, office, warehouse, agency, or subsidiary. Unlike the enterprise number, there's no legal requirement to print the branch number.  

All branches of a company receive a unique number that is different from the enterprise number. The branch number is transferable to another company, such as after a merger or takeover.  

The branch number is set up in the following locations:  

- Company Information table  
- Location table

# Set up export protocols in the Belgian version

Before you can use electronic banking, you must set up export protocols. Export protocols define the file format that is generated when you export payment history to be processed by the bank. Each line contains an export protocol identified by a code and a description. You can set up as many export protocols as necessary. You must set up an export protocol for domestic payments, international payments, SEPA payments, and non-Euro SEPA payments.  

 With export protocols, you can assign the codeunit that defines the check that should be performed before exporting the payment lines to a file and the report that defines the payment format. For example, you might have an export protocol named **DOM1**. This export protocol contains the **Check Domestic Payments** check codeunit and the **File Domestic Payments** report. Each export protocol has both a check codeunit and a matching report, as shown in the following table.  

|**Check Object ID**|**Export Object ID**|  
|-------------------------|--------------------------|  
|2000002 Check Domestic Payments|Report 2000001 File Domestic Payments|  
|2000003 Check International Payments|Report 2000002 File International Payments|  
|2000004 Check SEPA Payments|Report 2000005 File SEPA Payments|  
|2000005 Check Non-Euro SEPA Payments|Report 2000006 File Non-Euro SEPA Payments|  
|2000007 Check SEPA 001.001.09 Payments|Report 2000008 File FCY SEPA 001.001.09 Payments|
|If you don't want this option, set it to zero; otherwise, select another option.|XMLport 1000 (SEPA pain.001.001.03 Payments)|  

 After you set up export protocols, you can use them in your electronic banking payment journals.  

## Setup process

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Export Protocols**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Export Protocols**  page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

   |Field|Description|  
   |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
   |**Code**|Specify a code that uniquely identifies the export protocol.|  
   |**Description**|Specify a description for the export protocol entry. You can enter a maximum of 50 characters, both numbers and letters.|  
   |**Code Expenses**|Specify the code that describes the type of expenses associated with the export protocol entry. Code expenses include **blank**, **SHA**, **BEN**, and **OUR**. For international payments, **SHA** is the default.|  
   |**Check Object ID**|Specify the identification number of the codeunit that you want to use to perform a check on the object before the payment file is exported.|  
   |**Check Object Name**|Specify the name of a verification process that is used to perform a check on the object before the payment file is exported. After you select the **Check Object ID**, this field will display the **Check Object Name**.|  
   |**Export Object Type**|Specify the type of the object that defines the export format of the payment file export. After you select the **Export Object ID**, this field displays the **Export Object Type**.<br><br/> **NOTE:** To set up the export protocol for SEPA pain.001.001.03, select **XMLPort**.|  
   |**Export Object ID**|Specify the identification number of the object that defines the export format of the payment file export. For example, if you select **2000002**, the export format for the payment file is **File International Payments**.<br><br/> **NOTE:** To set up the export protocol for SEPA pain.001.001.03, select XMLport **1000**.|  
   |**Export No. Series**|Specify the number series that is used to assign identification numbers to the payment file export.|  
   |**Grouped Payment**|Specifies if this export protocol is used for grouped payments.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Summarizing payment lines and general journal lines in the Belgian version

Business Central summarizes payment lines and journal line across the following types of payments:  

- Domestic payments  
- International payments  
- SEPA payments  
- Non-Euro SEPA payments  

## How payment journal lines are transferred to the general journal

When you export the payment journal lines to a file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] transfers the payment journal lines to the specified general journal. By default, a general journal line is created for each payment journal line.  

The following two fields on the **Electronic Banking Setup** page affect how the payment lines are summarized:  

- **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines**  
- **Cut off Payment Message Texts**  

If you select the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox on the **Electronic Banking Setup** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] summarizes all payment journal lines for a specific vendor into one general journal line. The general description "Payment %1," where %1 is the vendor number, is used for the summarized journal line description. A separate payment line and a separate general journal line are created to handle:  

- Payment journal lines that contain partial payments, with both the **Partial Payment** and the **Separate Line** fields selected.  
- Payment journal lines that contain a standard format message (passes the MOD97 test), which sets **Standard Format Message** to True in the electronic banking journal.

## Example 1

In this example, you export payment lines, and the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox is selected. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates:  

- One combined payment line in an XML file that has a concatenated payment message. White space is the delimiter.  
- One payment line in the general journal with a generic description that includes the vendor name.  

## Example 2

In this example, you export payment lines, and the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox is selected. The **Cut off Payment Message Texts** checkbox is cleared, and the combined SEPA and non-Euro SEPA payment lines exceed 140 characters in the payment message. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates:  

- Two combined payment lines in an XML file. The first payment line contains the first concatenated payment messages. The second payment line contains the payment message from the third line.  
- One payment line in the general journal with a generic description that includes the vendor name.  

## Example 3

In this example, you export payment lines, and the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox is selected. The **Cut off Payment Message Texts** checkbox is also selected, and the combined SEPA and non-SEPA payment lines exceed 140 characters in the payment message. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates:  

- One combined payment line in an XML file that has two concatenated payment messages. An ellipsis (…) is used to indicate that the message is truncated.  
- One payment line in the general journal with a generic description that includes the vendor name.  

Based on the XML structure, the payments are summarized per account number, beneficiary bank account number, and bank account number. The bank account filter can be empty.  

The EndToEndId in the SEPA message is taken from the payment message and can be truncated to the maximum length of 45 characters.

# Belgian electronic payments

In the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can make the following types of electronic payments:  

|Electronic payment|Description|  
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Domestic|A local financial institution process these payments in the local currency (LCY) for beneficiaries who have accounts that have a local financial institution. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  
|International|A local financial institution process these payments that are either in foreign currencies or in LCY for beneficiaries who have accounts that have foreign financial institutions. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  
|SEPA|These payments are in Euro and are processed in countries/regions that accept SEPA payments. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  
|Non-Euro SEPA|These payments are in currency other than Euro and made to a country/region outside the European Economic Association (EEA). [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  

Because the standard for electronic payments is different for countries/regions, only financial institutions in Belgium can process electronic payments created in the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. The local financial institutions process the payment with the foreign institutions for international payments.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Credit memos can't be processed separately because payments must not have a negative balance. To process a credit memo, the credit memo must be added to one or more invoices by summarizing payments.  

Before you can make electronic payments, you must set up use electronic banking. Learn more in [Setup](belgian-electronic-banking.md#setup). You must also specify the relevant export protocols. Learn more in [Set Up Export Protocols](how-to-set-up-export-protocols.md).  

## Activate SEPA payments

[!INCLUDE [activate-sepa-payments](../includes/BENL/activate-sepa-payments.md)]

You can now make SEPA payments. Learn more in [Exporting Payments to a Bank File](../../finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file). If you don't use the AC Banking 365 capability, you can export payment journal lines to a file. Learn more in [Export Payment Files](how-to-print-payment-files.md).  

## File non-Euro SEPA payments

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can file non-Euro SEPA payments with the bank. This is useful when you make payments to other countries/regions that don't use SEPA and for currencies other than the Euro.  

Before you can file a non-Euro SEPA payment, you must complete the following administration tasks:  

1. Set up a new export protocol for a non-Euro SEPA.  
1. In the **Country/Region** table, clear the **SEPA Allowed** field for each country that belongs to the EEA zone.  
1. In the **General Ledger Setup** page, verify that the **Currency Euro** field is blank, and that the **SEPA Non-Euro Export** field is selected.  
1. Verify that the vendor's **Preferred Bank Account** field in the **Vendor** table contains the IBAN and SWIFT code.  

## File a non-Euro SEPA payment  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **File Non Euro SEPA Payments**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Journal Template Name**|Specify the general journal template for the non-Euro SEPA payment report.|  
    |**Journal Batch**|Specify the general journal batch for the non-Euro SEPA payment report.|  
    |**Post General Journal Lines**|Specify if you want to transfer the payment lines to the general ledger.|  
    |**Include Dimensions**|Enter the dimensions that you want to include in the non-Euro SEPA payment report. The option is available only if the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** field on the **Electronic Banking Setup** page is selected.|  
    |**Execution Date**|Enter an execution date if you want an execution date that differs from the posting date on the payment lines.|  
    |**File Name**|Enter the name of the file, including the drive and folder, to which you want to print the report.|  

## Correct payment lines

You must correct all errors before you can post the electronic payment lines. You can correct payment lines in the following ways.  

|Correction|Description|  
|----------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Add a payment journal line|If the payment journal already contains many lines and you want to add an additional line, you can enter the journal line manually. For example, if you want to reimburse a credit memo to a customer. These types of customer payments aren't suggested automatically by the **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job.|  
|Edit a payment journal line|If you don't assign a bank account to the payment journal or if you don't specify a preferred bank account on the Vendor card, you have to manually enter this information on each journal line before posting the journal. If you specify a bank account for a vendor, the bank account is copied to all payment journal lines for that vendor. Learn more in [Setup](belgian-electronic-banking.md#setup).|  
|Delete a payment journal line|The **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job creates payment suggestions for all vendors matching the specified criteria. If you want to prevent payment for a specific vendor ledger entry or vendor, you can delete the corresponding journal lines.|

# Belgian electronic banking

In the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can exchange data with Belgian financial institutions  electronically. This speeds up processing time and helps avoid errors caused by manual data entry or processing.  

You can use electronic banking to perform the following functions:  

- Send electronic payments.  
- Process bank statements with CODA.  
- Process direct debits with domiciliation.  

## Setup

Before you can process electronic payments and statements, you must set up electronic banking in the **Electronic Banking Setup** page as described in the following table.

|Field|Description |
|-----|------------|
|**Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines**| Select to indicate if you want to group the payment journal lines for each vendor. Payments with a structured message aren't grouped. |
|**Cut off Payment Message Texts** |Select to indicate if you want to truncate long payment messages. Messages are truncated if greater than 106 characters for domestic payments and less than 140 characters for international payments. |

Learn more in [Summarizing Payment Lines and General Journal Lines](summarizing-payment-lines-and-general-journal-lines.md), which explains how the two fields affect the transfer of payment journal lines to the general journal.

# Belgian CODA bank statements in the Belgian version

The Coded Statement of Account (CODA) is a national banking standard, designed by the Belgian Banker's Association, which allows you to automatically process electronic bank statements.  

Each type of transaction in a CODA statement is assigned a unique code. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] uses this code to interpret transactions and apply them to the corresponding ledger entries.  

## Applying statement lines

When you have imported a CODA statement, you can apply the statement lines to existing ledger entries, based on the information in the **Transaction Coding** table.  

If the transaction coding of the statement line isn't found, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] stops processing and continues with the next statement line. If you select the **Default Posting** field, the statement line is used as a default posting.  

If the transaction coding of the statement line is found, the statement lines are matched to the following account types and corresponding account numbers:  

- **General ledger**: If the account type is a general ledger account, the statement line is posted on the corresponding general ledger account.  

-**Customer or vendor**: If the account type is customer or vendor, a matching customer or vendor ledger entry is found based on the following criteria:

  - If a ledger entry is found using the standard format, the ledger entry is matched to the statement line, and the application status is set to **Applied**. If the ledger entry doesn't use the standard format, the bank account number of the customer or vendor is used to find the customer or vendor.
  - If no ledger entry with a matching remaining amount is found, the customer or vendor account is used, and the application status is set to **Partly Applied**.
  - If the bank account number is used to find the customer or vendor, a matching ledger entry is found based on the amount of the statement line. If the amount is found, the statement line is matched to the corresponding ledger entry, and the application status is set to **Applied**.  
  - If the bank account number can't be used to find the customer or vendor, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] either stops processing the current line or uses the line as a default posting, before continuing with the next statement line.  

You can run the process as many times as you like. Only statement lines with a blank application status are applied.  

When you have applied all statement lines to a general ledger account or to a matching customer ledger entry or vendor ledger entry, you're ready to post the CODA statement lines. Learn more in [Automatically Transfer and Post CODA Statements](how-to-manually-transfer-and-post-coda-statements.md).  

## Extending the CODA integration

The current support for CODA bank statements can be used in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises. However, partners can't extend the capabilities in an app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] online. The code isn't deprecated but can only be extended or customized for on-premises deployments.

# SEPA payments in the Belgian version

The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) unifies payment methods in participating European countries/regions. This makes international payments as easy to process as domestic payments. Regardless of location, European citizens and companies can make and receive payments in euros, whether within or across national/regional borders, with the same basic conditions, rights, and obligations.

# Enter and Post Cash and Bank/Giro Journals
The cash journal and the bank/giro journal help you post transactions into the system in an easier and more direct way than using the general journal.  

In conjunction with Telebanking, they allow you to import electronic bank statements into the **Bank/Giro Journal** page. The system can automatically reconcile these statements during the import process and determine whether a statement can be applied to open ledger entries for the relevant vendor/customer.

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can use the cash and bank journals to enter the transactions that affect the cash and bank accounts by using the **Cash Book** and **Bank Book** types.  

You can enter increases or decreases to the cash account on the **Cash Journal** page. For example, you can use this journal for paying out petty cash or receiving transfers from a different bank account.  

The **Bank/Giro Journal** page records the inflow or outflow of the cash to a specific bank account. This journal forms the basis for bank reconciliation. The layout of this journal resembles the paper bank statement, so you can transpose the required fields from the paper statement to the journal, or you can import an electronic bank statement file. The transactions can be customer payments or vendor payments.  

You can apply the payments from customers to the open invoices from accounts receivables. You can also enter general ledger transactions to capture miscellaneous amounts, such as bank charges or interest income. VAT codes can also be applied to these transaction lines. You can define a journal for every bank account.  

## To post cash journals  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  On the **Cash Journal** page, on the **Lines** FastTab, fill in the required fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|

    |**VAT Prod. Posting Group**|The VAT product posting group code used to post the entry. You can select a code in this field only if the **Account Type** is **G/L Account**. For more information, see VAT Product Posting Groups.|  
    |**Amount**|The total amount that the statement line consists of. You must enter the debit amount without a plus or minus sign and the credit amount with a minus sign.<br /><br /> If this amount includes the VAT amount, then select the **Amount incl. VAT** check box.|  

4.  Choose the **Post** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If there is a difference between the opening balance and the closing balance, you must change the closing balance before posting the entry.  

     The entries are posted to the general ledger. For more information, see General Ledger Entries.

# Single EURO Payments Area (SEPA)

The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) unifies payment methods in participating European countries/regions, making international payments as easy to process as domestic payments. 300 million European citizens and companies are able to make and receive payments in euros, whether within or across national/regional borders, with the same basic conditions, rights, and obligations, regardless of location.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports the Dutch requirements for submitting SEPA payments, credit transfers, and direct debit.  

Before you can submit vendor payments electronically in SEPA ISO2022 format, you must activate SEPA in the following pages:  

- Countries/Regions  
- Bank Accounts  
- Export Protocols  
- Transaction Modes  

Additionally you need to verify that vendor payment transaction modes and vendor bank accounts are set up to use SEPA for each vendor.  

Vendor payments made using SEPA ISO 20022 must comply with the following rules.  

- Make all payments in euros.  
- Make payments within the European Economic Area (EEA).  
- Use the vendor bank’s International Bank Account Number (IBAN) and Bank Identifier Code (BIC) information.

# Set up VAT categories

To use the electronic VAT declaration, you must set up a VAT category code for all XML elements in the electronic VAT declaration.  

You must set up all of the possible category and subcategory combinations that represent an XML element in the electronic VAT declaration. Then, you can map the VAT statement data directly to an XML element.  

## Set up a VAT category  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax. Decl. VAT Categories**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Elec. Tax. Decl. VAT Categories** page, choose the **New** action.  
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|The unique code for each category and subcategory combination. You can enter a maximum of 10 alphanumeric characters.|  
    |**Category**|Specify the main category option for the VAT statement.|  
    |**By Us (Domestic)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **By Us (Domestic)**.|  
    |**To Us (Domestic)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **To Us (Domestic)**.|  
    |**By Us (Foreign)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **By Us (Foreign)**.|  
    |**To Us (Foreign)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **To Us (Foreign)**.|  
    |**Calculation**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **Calculation**.|  
    |**Optional**|Select to indicate that the XML element that is represented by the category code isn't required in the electronic VAT declaration.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

You can now map the VAT statement data directly to an XML element.

# Submitting electronic VAT and ICP declarations in the Dutch version
Companies must submit periodic VAT and Intracommunautaire leveringen (ICP) declarations to the tax authorities.  

VAT declarations must be submitted on a monthly or quarterly basis.
ICP declarations must be submitted on a quarterly basis.

> [!NOTE]  
> ICP declarations must be submitted by companies/regions that sell goods or services to European Union (EU) countries. Purchases are not included in this declaration. <br /><br />
For a transaction to qualify for ICP, it is required that the merchandise have crossed the border physically. It is not enough that the location of an invoice address or the office of the vendor or customer is in another EU country or region.  

You can submit the VAT declarations and ICP declarations in the following ways:  

- Sign in to the website of the Dutch tax office and enter the information manually. For more information, see the [website](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/en/individuals/individuals) of the Dutch tax office.  

- Create an electronic declaration and submit the encrypted file through the Digipoort channel to the Dutch tax office. Digipoort is the electronic post office provided by the Dutch government for companies. It provides the common infrastructure for the communication of information between companies and the government, including VAT declarations. The reports are in the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) format. For more information, see [Create Reports with XBRL](../../bi-create-reports-with-xbrl.md).

## To prepare for electronic declaration
Before you can send electronic declarations to the tax authorities, you must perform the following tasks:

1. Ensure that you obtain the certificates from the government. If you haven't, take the following steps to obtain the certificates:

    - Obtain a PKIoverheid certificate for the company if you don't have one already. A list of certificate providers can be found here: [https://www.logius.nl/producten/toegang/pkioverheid/aansluiten/toegetreden-csps](https://www.logius.nl/producten/toegang/pkioverheid/aansluiten/toegetreden-csps).  

    - Register a user of Digipoort, which can be done here: [https://aansluiten.procesinfrastructuur.nl/site/registratienieuw](https://aansluiten.procesinfrastructuur.nl/site/registratienieuw).

    - Obtain a **Digipoort Service certificate**, which can be obtained at the Dutch Tax Administration website: [https://aansluiten.procesinfrastructuur.nl](https://aansluiten.procesinfrastructuur.nl).

2. Enter general data and personal data received from the tax authorities on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page. For more information, see [Setting Up Electronic VAT and ICP Declarations](how-to-set-up-electronic-vat-and-icp-declarations.md).

3. Set up a VAT category code for all XML elements in the electronic VAT declaration. For more information, see [Set Up VAT Categories](how-to-set-up-vat-categories.md).

## To create an electronic declaration
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Declarations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration List** page, choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. Choose the **OK** button.

The XML elements and the accompanying data of the electronic declaration are displayed on the **Lines** FastTab on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page.

The XBRL reporter ensures that all account numbers that are imported from Business Central are mapped to the XBRL elements in a report. The XBRL reporter also displays a list of errors of unmapped elements or accounts.

## To submit an electronic declaration
With the XBRL reporter, you can submit the Intracommunautaire Leveringen (ICP) declaration or the VAT declaration in the required XML format. When it's submitted, the file is sent to the tax authorities as defined on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page.

1. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page, choose the **Submit Electronic Tax Declaration** action.
2. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Client Certificate**|Select the **PKIoverheid** certificate for the company.|  
    |**Client Certificate Password**|Enter the password that encrypts the client certificate.|
    |**Service Certificate**|Select the **Digipoort Service** certificate.|

3. Choose the **OK** button.  

The electronic declaration is submitted to the tax authorities.

> [!NOTE]  
> If there are no intra-community deliveries in the declaration period, then an electronic ICP declaration is created without XML elements for the deliveries. If you submit such a declaration, an error message will be displayed.

## To import a response message from the tax authorities
For each electronic declaration, the tax authorities send a response message. These messages must be received from the server of the tax authorities
and be processed. The first step is to import the response message into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Decl. Response Msgs.**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Receive Response Messages** action.  
3. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Client Certificate**|Select the **PKIoverheid** certificate for the company.|  
    |**Client Certificate Password**|Enter the password that encrypts the client certificate.|
    |**Service Certificate**|Select the **Digipoort Service** certificate.|  

4. Choose the **OK** button.

## To process a response message from the tax authorities
When a response message is imported, it must be processed by validating its content against the related electronic declaration. If no errors are found in the electronic declaration and the data has been processed by the tax authorities, then the **Status** field on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page is changed to **Acknowledgement**.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Decl. Response Msgs.**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Process Response Messages** action.  
3. On the **Process Response Messages Batch Job** page, select the appropriate filters, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    The processed information about the response message is displayed in the **Elec. Tax Decl. Response Msgs.**. page.  

4. To export a message or attachment, choose the **Export Response Message** action or the **Export Response Attachment** action.

# Telebanking

Based on both sales and purchase transactions, telebanking enables you to generate your payments and collections and interchange them with your bank electronically. This includes the export of payment and collection data that need to be forwarded to the bank and the import of bank statements sent to you by the bank.  

## Transactions

In general, all financial interactions with vendors and customers are done through either purchase or sales invoices and credit memos. As soon as these transactions are registered and posted, payments, or collections can be carried out by your company.  

## Proposals

Based on vendor and customer ledger entries, telebanking enables you to generate payment and collection proposals. This can be done for any bank that is set up for your company. Both domestic and foreign payments and collections are possible.  

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to combine payments to or collections from the same bank account automatically.  

When a proposal is agreed upon, it should be processed into a payment history.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In general, for any open vendor and customer ledger entries, a proposal can be generated if it meets a number of criteria. Learn more in [Create Proposals](how-to-create-proposals.md).  

## Payment histories

A payment history is nothing more than a proposal except for the fact that data on a payment history can't be modified. The payment or collection data is ready to be exported and forwarded to the bank. Learn more in [Create and Export Payment History](how-to-create-and-export-payment-history.md).  

## Bank statements

For all your financial interactions through your bank, the bank can send you electronic bank statements. These statements can be imported into the Bank/Giro Journals. If you want, you can have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically reconcile these statements during this import process and determine whether a statement can be applied to open ledger entries for the relevant vendor/customer. Learn more in [Import and Reconcile Bank Statements](how-to-import-and-reconcile-bank-statements.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The currency of the imported transactions must match the currency that is specified on the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Exchange protocols

For both exporting and importing, a number of protocols are defined. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports the following protocols:  

- BTL91 (export). This cross-border protocol is no longer accepted in the Netherlands as of May 1, 2019. This protocol is replaced by the Generic Payment File protocol.
- BBV (export)  
- PAYMUL (export)  
- Generic Payment File (export). Can be used for cross-border Non-EUR transfers.
- Rabobank mut.asc (import)  
- Rabobank vvmut.asc (import)  
- Rabobank ASCII (import)  
- SEPA CAMT

# Docket Reports in the Dutch Version
The Dutch telebanking application allows you to combine ledger entries for the same customer or vendor, having the same transaction mode, into one payment or collection order to the bank. As such one total amount will be paid to or collected from the vendor or customer involved. Possibly this combined payment could lack all detail information about the individual payments or collections. Telebanking offers you the possibility to inform your vendor or customer in detail by generating a docket report that describes the individual payments that constitute the total amount paid or collected.  

When generating payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job the system will select the **Docket** check box on the proposal in case that:  

- The resulting combined payment includes too many invoice numbers to list them in the available four description fields of the new proposal line: **Description 1** field, **Description 2** field, **Description 3** field, and **Description 4** field.  

- The payment is not based upon an invoice.

# Payment scenario 1 - Domestic payments (LCY to LCY) in the Dutch version

You can use telebanking for trade with domestic and foreign customers and vendors. This article describes a scenario where the trade is with domestic customers and vendors.  

The following list describes the main steps:  

1. Create Vendor/Customer.  
1. Create Vendor/Customer Bank Account.  
1. Create and Post Purchase Invoice for Vendor or Sales Invoice for Customer.  
1. Create Proposal.  
1. Create Payment History.  
1. Export Payment History.  
1. Import Bank Statement.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In the following examples, some standard CRONUS data is being used. Likewise, instead of creating a vendor/customer and a vendor/customer bank account, you can use existing data.  

## Create vendor/customer

Create vendor/customer and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Leave empty - that is, it's set to the local currency (LCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with local currency payments for your bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code as the vendor/customer itself.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To enter a bank account in the **Bank Account** vendor/customer bank accounts must be available. See below.  

### Example

Olek Johansson (code **OLEK**) is one of our local vendors. Purchase invoices are paid through our national bank account (code **ABN**) to their bank account (code **OJBA**). Both bank account ABN and OJBA are denominated in local currency (LCY). Therefore, on Olek Johansson's vendor card, we leave the **Currency Code** field empty, fill the **Transaction Mode** field with **ABN** that is linked to our bank account, ABN, and set the **Bank Account** field to **OJBA**.  

## Create vendor/customer bank account

Create vendor/customer bank account and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Preferred Bank Account**: Enter a valid bank account number.  
- **Currency Code**: Leave empty - that is, it's set to the local currency (LCY).  
- **Owner Information**: Be sure all owner information is entered.  

### Example

Olek Johansson's bank account (code **OJBA**) is denominated in local currency (LCY). Therefore, on Olek Johansson's vendor bank account card, we enter a valid number in the **Bank Account No.** field, leave the **Currency Code** field empty, and fill the fields on the **Owner Information** FastTab with appropriate values.  

## Create and post purchase invoice for vendor or sales invoice for customer

Create a purchase/sales invoice and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Leave empty - that is, it's set to the local currency (LCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with local currency payments for your bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code is the vendor/customer itself.  

By default these three fields are populated with values taken from the vendor/customer card.  

When the invoice is finished, it can be posted.  

### Example

When creating a purchase invoice for Olek Johansson, we enter **OLEK** in the **Buy-from Vendor No.** field. By default the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode** and **Bank Account** fields are populated with values taken from the Olek Johansson's vendor card. Therefore, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are **\<empty\>**, **ABN**, and **OJBA** respectively. Nevertheless, these values can be changed.  

## Create proposal

Open the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page and browse to the bank through which we want to perform our payment. Open the **Proposal** page and generate payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job.  

### Example

Through the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page, we open the **Proposal** page for our bank, ABN. Using the batch job, one proposal line is created for the purchase invoice we just created and posted for vendor OLEK.  

## Create payment history

From the **Proposal** page, we process our proposal into a payment history. The proposal disappears and can be found on the **Payment History Overview** page for the same bank.  

### Example

We process our proposal concerning the payment to vendor OLEK and open the **Payment History Overview** page for our bank, ABN. The last payment history is the one we created.  

## Export payment history

Open the **Payment History Overview** page, browse to the relevant payment history, and choose the **Export** action. The export batch job appears for the export protocol that is linked to this payment. For this export, the system already enters appropriate filters. Check, if wanted, any of the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and then choose the **OK** action to export the payment. The system generates a text file using a filename as defined in the **Default File Names Field** field of the export protocol, which now is ready to be sent to our bank.  

## Import bank statement

After receiving electronic bank statements from our bank, we can import them by running the appropriate import protocol from the **Import Protocol List** page.  

### Example

The bank statement containing our payment to Olek Johansson is sent to us by our bank, ABN. Therefore, we should choose **OFFICE NET EXTRA** as the appropriate import protocol.

# Payment scenarios

Based on a sales or purchase invoice or credit memo, a proposal can be generated and exported in order to  process it by our bank.  

Using telebanking you can deal with three scenarios:  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in your local currency (LCY), which is the same currency as linked to the invoice/credit memo. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 1 - Domestic Payments (LCY to LCY)](payment-scenario-1-domestic-payments-lcy-to-lcy-.md).  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in the same currency as the currency linked to the invoice/credit memo. Both foreign. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 2 - Foreign Payment (FCY to FCY)](payment-scenario-2-foreign-payment-fcy-to-fcy-.md).  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in your local currency (LCY), while the invoice/credit memo is linked to a foreign currency. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 3 - Foreign Payment (LCY  to FCY)](payment-scenario-3-foreign-payment-lcy-to-fcy-.md).

# Payment scenario 2 - Foreign payment (FCY to FCY) in the Dutch version

You can use telebanking for trade with domestic and foreign customers and vendors. This article describes a scenario where the trade is with foreign customers and vendor that use the same foreign currency as your bank account is set up to use.  

The following list describes the main steps:  

1. Create Vendor/Customer.  
1. Create Vendor/Customer Bank Account.  
1. Create and Post Purchase Invoice for Vendor or Sales Invoice for Customer.  
1. Create Proposal.  
1. Create Payment History.  
1. Export Payment History.  
1. Import Bank Statement.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In the examples below, some standard CRONUS data is being used. Likewise, instead of creating a vendor/customer and a vendor/customer bank account you could use existing data.  

## Create vendor/customer

 Create vendor/customer and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with foreign currency payments for your foreign bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code as the vendor/customer itself.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To enter a bank account in the **Bank Account** vendor/customer bank accounts must be available. See below.  

### Example

Jannet Carter (code **JANNET**) is one of our US vendors. Purchase invoices are paid through our foreign bank account (code **ABN-USD**) to their bank account (code **JCBA**). Both bank account ABN-USD and JCBA are denominated in the same foreign currency (FCY) - that is, USD. Therefore, on Jannet Carter's vendor card, we set the **Currency Code** field to **USD**, fill the **Transaction Mode** field with **ABN-USD** that is linked to our bank account, ABN-USD, and set the **Bank Account** field to **JCBA**.  

## Create vendor/customer bank account

Create vendor/customer bank account and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Preferred Bank Account**: Enter a valid bank account number.  
- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Owner Information**: Make sure all owner information is entered.  

### Example

Jannet Carter's bank account (code **JCBA**) is denominated in foreign currency (FCY) - that is, USD. Therefore, on Jannet Carter's vendor bank account card, we enter a valid number in the **Bank Account No.** field, set the **Currency Code** field to **USD**, and fill the fields on the **Owner Information** tab with appropriate values.  

## Create and post purchase invoice for vendor or sales invoice for customer

Create a purchase/sales invoice and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with foreign currency payments for your foreign bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code is the vendor/customer itself.  

By default, these three fields are populated with values taken from the vendor/customer card.  

When the invoice is finished, it can be posted.  

### Example

When creating a purchase invoice for Jannet Carter, we enter **JANNET** in the **Buy-from Vendor No.** field. By default, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are populated with values taken from the Jannet Carter's vendor card. Therefore, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are **USD**, **ABN-USD**, and **JCBA** respectively. Nevertheless, these values can be changed.  

## Create proposal

Open the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page and browse to the bank through which we want to perform our payment. Open the **Proposal** page and generate payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job.  

### Example

Through the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page, we open the **Proposal** page for our bank, ABN-USD. Using the batch job, one proposal line is created for the purchase invoice we just created and posted for the vendor JANNET.  

## Create payment history

From the **Proposal** page we process our proposal into a payment history. The proposal disappears and can be found on the **Payment History Overview** page for the same bank.  

### Example

We process our proposal concerning the payment to the vendor JANNET and open the **Payment History Overview** page for our bank, ABN-USD. The last payment history is the one we created.  

## Export payment history

Open the **Payment History Overview** page, browse to the relevant payment history, and choose the **Export** action. The export batch job appears for the export protocol that is linked to this payment. For this export, the system already has entered appropriate filters. Check, if wanted, any of the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and then choose the **OK** button to export the payment. The system generates a text file using a filename as defined in the **Default File Names Field** field of the export protocol, which now is ready to be sent to our bank.  

### Example

As the transaction mode associated with our payment is ABN-USD, the **BBV** or **PAYMUL** batch job appear.  

## Import bank statement

After receiving electronic bank statements from our bank, we can import them by running the appropriate import protocol from the **Import Protocol List** page.  

### Example

Our bank sent us the bank statement containing our payment to Jannet Carter, ABN-USD. Therefore, we choose **OFFICE NET EXTRA** as the appropriate import protocol.

description: This article describes a third scenario where you can use telebanking for trade with domestic and foreign customers and vendors.

# Payment scenario 3 - Foreign payment (LCY  to FCY) in the Dutch version

You can use telebanking for trade with domestic and foreign customers and vendors. This article describes a scenario where the trade is with foreign customers and vendors that use a different currency than your local currency.  

1. Create Vendor/Customer.  
1. Create Vendor/Customer Bank Account.  
1. Create and Post Purchase Invoice for Vendor or Sales Invoice for Customer.  
1. Create Proposal.  
1. Create Payment History.  
1. Export Payment History.  
1. Import Bank Statement.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In the following examples, some standard CRONUS data is being used. Likewise, instead of creating a vendor/customer and a vendor/customer bank account you could use existing data.  

## Create vendor/customer

Create vendor/customer and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with foreign currency payments for your local bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code as the vendor/customer itself.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To enter a bank account in the **Bank Account**, vendor/customer bank accounts must be available. See below.  

### Example

Hernandez Ortiz (code **ORTIZ**) is one of our Mexican vendors. Purchase invoices are paid through our national bank account (code **ABN**) to their bank account (code **HOBA**). While our bank account ABN is denominated in local currency (LCY), Hernandez Ortiz's bank account HOBA is denominated in Mexican peso (MXN). Therefore, on Hernandez Ortiz's vendor card, we set the **Currency Code** field to **MXN**, fill the **Transaction Mode** field with **ABN** that is linked to our bank account, ABN, and set the **Bank Account** field to **HOBA**.  

## Create vendor/customer bank account

Create vendor/customer bank account and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Preferred Bank Account**: Enter a valid bank account number.  
- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Owner Information**: Be sure all owner information is entered.  

### Example

Hernandez Ortiz's bank account (code **HOBA**) is denominated in **MXN**. Therefore, on Hernandez Ortiz's vendor bank account card, we enter a valid number in the **Bank Account No.** field, set the **Currency Code** field to **MXN**, and fill the fields on the **Owner Information** FastTab with appropriate values.  

## Create and post purchase invoice for vendor or sales invoice for customer

Create a purchase/sales invoice and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with local currency payments for your local bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code is the vendor/customer itself.  

By default these three fields are populated with values taken from the vendor/customer card.  

When the invoice is finished, it can be posted.  

### Example

When creating a purchase invoice for Hernandez Ortiz, we enter **ORTIZ** in the **Buy-from Vendor No.** field. By default, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are populated with values taken from the Hernandez Ortiz's vendor card. Therefore, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are **MXN**, **ABN**, and **HOBA** respectively. Nevertheless, these values can be changed.  

## Create proposal

Open the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page and browse to the bank through which we want to perform our payment. Open the **Proposal** page and generate payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job.  

### Example

Through the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page, we open the **Proposal** page for our bank, ABN. Using the batch job, one proposal line is created for the purchase invoice we just created and posted for the vendor ORTIZ. The amount of the payment is in local currency (LCY).  

## Create payment history

From the **Proposal** page, we process our proposal into a payment history. The proposal disappears and can be found on the **Payment History Overview** page for the same bank.  

### Example

We process our proposal concerning the payment to the vendor ORTIZ and open the **Payment History Overview** page for our bank, ABN. The last payment history is the one we just created.  

## Export payment history

Open the **Payment History Overview** page, browse to the relevant payment history, and then choose the **Export** action. The export batch job appears for the export protocol that is linked to this payment. For this export, the system already has entered appropriate filters. Check, if wanted, any of the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and choose the **OK** button to export the payment. The system generates a text file using a filename as defined in the **Default File Names Field** field of the export protocol, which now is ready to be sent to our bank.  

### Example

As the transaction mode associated with our payment is **ABN**, the **BBV** or **PAYMUL** batch job appears.  

## Import bank statement

After receiving electronic bank statements from our bank, we can import them by running the appropriate import protocol from the **Import Protocol List** page.  

### Example

The bank statement containing our payment to Hernandez Ortiz is sent to us by our bank, ABN. Therefore, we should choose **OFFICE NET EXTRA** as the appropriate import protocol.

# Required descriptions in G-L entry

When entering general journal lines on a form, the system automatically fills in the description field. This description is also stored in the G/L entry after posting the journal. For a good audit trail, a more detailed description is desirable, when you post a journal line of type G/L Account.  

To force the user to enter a more detailed description, it's possible to choose if the system must fill in automatically the description of the G/L account or leave the field blank. If the **Omit Default Descr. in Jnl. Field** checkbox on the **G/L Account Card** page is checked, the system doesn't fill in the **Description** field for that G/L account when selected in a general journal line.  

When posting the journal lines, the system checks if all the **Description** fields are filled in. If there's a blank description, an error message appears.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Leaving the description field blank and checking if all the description fields are filled in before posting will only be done on the general journal pages in several application areas and on the local Cash Bank Giro pages.

# CMR Notes in the Dutch Version
A CMR note is a bill of lading or an international consignment note defined under the 1956 United Nations Convention for the Contract of the International Carriage of Goods by Road. This is also known as the CMR Convention.  

 Claims with complete CMR note information are easily processed.  

## CMR Notes  
Countries/Regions that follow the CMR Convention adhere to a standard form for CMR notes. The type of CMR note used depends on the type of transaction. There are three types:  

- **CMR - Sales Shipment** – This report is used to print CMR documents for sales shipments. For each CMR document, the report shows address data for the sender, shipping agent and consignee, along with data about the shipped items.

- **CMR - Purchase Return Shipment** – This report is used to print CMR documents for purchase return shipments. For each CMR document, the report shows address data for the sender, shipping agent and consignee, along with data about the shipped items.       

- **CMR - Transfer Shipment** – This report is used to print CMR documents for transfer shipments. For each CMR document, the report shows address data for the location from which the items are shipped, the location to which the items are shipped, and information regarding the shipping agent, along with data about the shipped items.

> [!NOTE]  
>  CMR notes are formatted to print on preprinted CMR forms.  

The following details the standard life cycle of a CMR note:  

- The warehouse manager prints the CMR notes for the shipments that need to be sent.  
- The shipments are then packed and handed to the truck driver, along with the CMR notes.  
- The driver ensures that each shipment has a CMR note.  
- When goods are delivered to the customers, the driver ensures that the customers sign the CMR notes.  
- The signed CMR notes are then given to the respective internal Accounts Receivable departments.  
- The Accounts Payable administrators receive the signed CMR notes, along with the invoice for freight forwarding services from the freight forwarder.

# Setting up electronic VAT and ICP declarations in the Dutch version

To create electronic VAT and ICP declarations and communicate with tax authorities, set up general information about electronic tax declarations. Your company must be registered with the tax authorities before you can send electronic declarations.

When electronic declarations are set up, you can begin to declare VAT and ICP to the tax authorities. Learn more in [Submitting Electronic VAT and ICP Declarations](electronic-vat-and-icp-declarations.md).  

## Set up electronic declarations  

Ensure that you've uploaded the certificates needed to communicate with Digipoort. Use the **Certificates** page to upload a client and a service certificate. When they're added to the list of certificates, you can continue with setting up electronics declarations.

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
1. If you want the contact ID in the electronic declaration to be filled with the VAT registration number of the company, then select  **Tax Payer** in the **VAT Contact Type** field.
1. If you want to send electronic ICP declarations for a subsidiary company of a fiscal entity, select the **Part of Fiscal Entity** checkbox.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > If a company has several companies registered as subsidiaries of a holding company, they have the option to submit the VAT declaration individually or combined for one fiscal entity. To set up electronic declarations for subsidiaries of a holding company, you must select the **Part of Fiscal Entity** field on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page. You can then create an electronic declaration for only one company.<br><br/>
   If you want to combine the tax information for all subsidiaries of a holding company, you must create a VAT statement on paper for each subsidiary company and manually calculate the total amounts for the holding company. These total amounts of the holding company must be entered on the website of the tax authorities.<br><br/>
   You can't combine tax information for ICP declarations. ICP declarations must always be submitted individually.<br><br/>
   For each subsidiary company, an electronic ICP declaration can be created and submitted to the tax authorities. These electronic ICP declarations must contain the VAT registration number of the subsidiary company and the value of the **Fiscal Entity No.** field on the **Company Information** page of the holding company.

1. On the **Digipoort** FastTab, set up the following configurations:
   - In the **Digipoort Delivery URL** field, specify the URL for the production version of the Digipoort Aanlever service. Learn more on [digipoort](https://www.logius.nl/producten/gegevensuitwisseling/digipoort).  
   - In the **Digipoort Status URL** field, specify the URL for the status information that is coming from the Digipoort Statusinformatie service. Learn more in [Electronic VAT and ICP Declarations](electronic-vat-and-icp-declarations.md).
   - Select **Use Certificate Setup** to specify that the certificate codes specified in the next step must be considered to transfer data to the information service.
   - In the **Client Certificate Code** field, specify the client certificate.
   - In the **Service Certificate Code** field, specify the service certificate.

1. To set up endpoints, add the endpoint URLs on the **Endpoints** FastTab.

   > [!NOTE]  
   > Endpoints set up is deployed to 21.1 tenants. However, all values are blank, but the Digipoort solution still works by taking hardcoded values if there are no values in the setup. In the 21.2 release, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically runs an upgrade.

# Create an Audit File for the Tax Authority in the Dutch Version
During an examination of the books for a fiscal year, a tax inspector can ask for data about the basis transactions from the general ledger for that fiscal year. Basis transactions usually are processed via journal entries. That is the reason why the journal entries are the basis for the audit file.  

 The tax authority stimulates companies to use the audit file but it is not prescribed.  

 The audit file can also be used to exchange data between companies. You can select every period you want, but the start and end date of the entered period must be in the same fiscal year.  

## To make an Audit file  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Tax Authority - Audit File**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Start Date**|Specify the start date of the period on which the data must be based.|  
    |**End Date**|Specify the end date of the period on which the data must be based.|  
    |**Exclude Begin Balance**|Specifies if the audit file must contain the begin balance of general ledger accounts.<br /><br /> The field is editable if the start date of the period is equal to the start date of a fiscal year.|  

3.  Choose the **OK** button to create the audit file. If you do not want to create the audit file, choose the **Cancel** button to close the page.  

When you run the report, you must specify the name and location of the exported file. The default file name is **audit.xaf**, but you can change that. The file extension must be .xaf.

# Dutch Electronic Banking

Electronic banking functionality allows you to create electronic payment files and direct debit files, and to import electronic bank statements from supported bank software.  

## Telebanking

Using Telebanking, you can export payments, import bank statements, and collect data to forward to the bank. For more information, see [Telebanking](telebanking.md).  

You can create payment proposals and reconcile bank accounts in the cash, bank, and giro journals.  

### Payment Files

You can make payment proposals for paying open invoices to suppliers. Payment proposals can be edited manually prior to processing to add or remove payment invoices, or to change payment amounts. After processing a proposed payment batch, you can transfer electronic payment files to the bank. If an error occurs in the payment file while importing into the banking software, you can make a copy of the payment file to resubmit to the bank.  

You can make domestic payments and international payments using the designated formats. For more information, see [Telebanking](telebanking.md).  

### Direct Debit Files

You can create a payment proposal to collect payment from customer bank accounts. You can edit payment proposals manually to add or remove invoices, or to change collection amounts. After processing a proposed payment batch, you can transfer electronic direct debit files to the bank. If an error occurs in the direct debit file while importing into the banking software, you can make a copy of the direct debit file to resubmit to the bank.  

You can only collect payments domestically at this time. For more information, see [Create Proposals](how-to-create-proposals.md).  

### Bank Statement Import

You can import bank statements from supported bank software, and reconcile them with incoming and outgoing payments. You can also reconcile bank charges and interest earned.  

For more information, see [Import and Reconcile Bank Statements](how-to-import-and-reconcile-bank-statements.md).
