# Block customers
You can block a customer, for example because of insolvency, so that the customer can't be added to sales documents or so that no transactions can be posted for the customer.

In addition to blocking a customer, you can set receivable transactions for the customer to be on hold in connection with reminders. For more information, see [Collect Outstanding Balances](receivables-collect-outstanding-balances.md).   

The following table describes the options for blocking customers.  

|Option|Description|  
|--------------------|------------|  
|**Blank**|Transactions are allowed for this customer.|
|**Ship**|New orders and new shipments can't be created for this customer. Existing shipments not yet invoiced can be invoiced.|  
|**Invoice**|New orders, new shipments, and new invoices can't be created for this customer. Existing shipments not yet invoiced can't be invoiced. You can still send reminders and finance charge memos to the customer.|  
|**All**|No transaction is allowed for this customer, including payments.|  

## To block a customer  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a customer, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. In the **Blocked** field, choose what to block, as described in the table above.

# Design Details: Transfers in Planning

Transfer orders are also a source of supply when working at the SKU level. When using multiple locations (warehouses), the SKU replenishment system can be set to Transfer, implying that the location is replenished by transferring goods from another location. In a situation with more warehouses, you might have a chain of transfers. Supply to GREEN location is transferred from YELLOW, supply to YELLOW is transferred from RED, and so on. In the beginning of the chain, there's a replenishment system of **Prod. Order** or **Purchase**.  

![Example of transfer flow.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers1.png "Example of transfer flow")  

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [locations-cronus](includes/locations-cronus.md)]

If you compare the following situations, it's clear that the planning task in the latter can become complex:

* A supply order is directly facing a demand order
* A sales order is supplied through a chain of SKU transfers

If demand changes, it might cause a ripple effect through the chain. All transfer orders, plus the purchase and production order in the opposite end of the chain, will have to be updated to re-balance demand and supply.  

![Example of supply/demand balance in transfers.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers2.png "Example of supply/demand balance in transfers")  

## Why is a transfer a special case?  

Transfer orders are similar to other orders, such as purchase and production orders. However, behind the scene they're different.  

One difference is that a transfer line represents both demand and supply. The outbound part that's shipped is demand. The inbound part that's received at the new location is supply at that location.  

![Content of the Transfer Order page.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers3.png "Content of the Transfer Order page")  

When [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] changes the supply side of the transfer, it must make a similar change on the demand side.  

## Transfers are dependent demand  

The demand and supply relationship is similar to components on production order lines. The difference is that components on production order lines are on the next planning level, and have a different item. The two parts of the transfer are on the same level for the same item.  

An important similarity is that components and transfers are dependent demand. Demand from a transfer line is dictated by the supply side of the transfer. If the supply changes, the demand is directly affected.

Unless the planning flexibility is None, a transfer line shouldn't be treated as independent demand in planning.  

In the planning procedure, the transfer demand should only be taken into account after the planning system has processed the supply side. Before that processing happens, the actual demand isn't known. The sequence of changes is important for transfer orders.  

## Planning sequence  

The following image shows an example of a string of transfers.  

![Example of simple transfer flow.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers4.png "Example of simple transfer flow")  

In this example, a customer orders the item at location GREEN. Location GREEN is supplied through transfer from the central warehouse RED. The central warehouse RED is supplied by transfer from production on location BLUE.  

In this example, the planning system starts at the customer demand and works its way back through the chain. The demands and supplies are processed for one location at a time.  

![Supply planning with transfers.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers5.png "Supply planning with transfers")  

## Transfer level code  

The transfer level code of the SKU determines the sequence in which the planning system processes locations.  

The transfer level code is an internal field. The field is calculated and stored on the SKU when you create or modify the SKU. The calculation runs across all SKUs for a given combination of item and item variant. The calculation uses the location code and the transfer-from code to determine the route to use for the SKUs. The calculation ensures that all demands are processed.  

The transfer level code will be 0 for SKUs with Purchase or Prod. Order replenishment system, and will be -1 for the first transfer level, -2 for the second, and so on. In the example described in the previous section, the levels would be -1 for RED and -2 for GREEN, as shown in the following illustration.  

![Content of SKU Card page.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers6.gif "Content of SKU Card page")  

When updating a SKU, the planning system detects whether replenishment systems for SKUs have circular references.  

## Planning transfers without SKU  

For less advanced warehouse setups, you can use locations and make manual transfers between locations, even if you don't use SKUs. For example, the transfer might cover a sales order at that location. The planning system reacts to changes in the demand.  

For manual transfers, the planning system analyzes transfer orders and then plans the order in which to process the locations. Internally, the planning system uses temporary SKUs that have transfer level codes.  

![Transfer level code.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers7.png "Transfer level code")  

If there are several transfers to a location, the first transfer order defines the planning direction. Transfers in the opposite direction are canceled.  

## Changing quantity with reservations  

When changing quantities on a supply, the planning system takes reservations into account. The reserved quantity represents the lower limit for how much to reduce the supply.  

When you change the quantity on a transfer order line, keep the lower limit in mind. The lower limit is the highest reserved quantity of the outbound and inbound transfer lines.

For example, a transfer order line of 117 pieces is reserved for the following lines:

* A sales line of 46
* A purchase line of 24

Even though the inbound side might have excess supply, you can't reduce the transfer line below 46.  

![Reservations in transfer planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers8.png "Reservations in transfer planning")  

## Changing quantity in a transfer chain  

Here's an example of what happens when you change a quantity in a transfer change.

The starting point is a balanced situation with a transfer chain supplying a sales order of 27 at location RED. There's a corresponding purchase order at location BLUE. Both transfers go through location PINK. There are two transfer orders, BLUE-PINK and PINK-RED.  

![Changing the quantity in transfer planning 1.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers9.png "Changing the quantity in transfer planning 1")  

Now, the planner at the PINK location chooses to reserve for the purchase.  

![Changing the quantity in transfer planning 2.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers10.png "Changing the quantity in transfer planning 2")  

The reservation usually means that the planning system ignores the purchase order and transfer demand. There isn't a problem long as there's balance. But what happens when the RED location changes the order from 27 to 22?  

![Changing the quantity in transfer planning 3.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers11.png "Changing the quantity in transfer planning 3")  

When the planning system runs again, it should get rid of excess supply. However, the reservation locks the purchase and the transfer to a quantity of 27.  

![Changing the quantity in transfer planning 4.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers12.png "Changing the quantity in transfer planning 4")  

The PINK-RED transfer has been reduced to 22. The inbound part of the BLUE-PINK transfer isn't reserved, but the outbound part is. The reservation means that you can't reduce the quantity below 27.  

## Lead time calculation  

When calculating the due date of a transfer order, different kinds of lead time are taken into account.  

The following lead times are active when planning a transfer order:  

* Outbound warehouse handling time  
* Shipping time  
* Inbound warehouse handling time  

On the planning line, the following fields are used to provide information about the calculation:  

* Transfer shipment date  
* Starting date  
* Ending date  
* Due date  

The shipment date of the transfer line is shown in the **Transfer Shipment Date** field. The receipt date of the transfer line is shown in the **Due Date** field.  

The starting and ending dates describe the actual transportation period.  

The following image shows the interpretation of the starting date-time and ending date-time on planning lines for transfer orders.  

![Central date-times in transfer planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers13.png "Central date-times in transfer planning")  

The example shows the following calculations:  

* Shipment date + Outbound handling = Starting Date  
* Starting Date + Shipping time = Ending Date  
* Ending Date + Inbound Handling = Receipt Date  

## Safety lead time  

The **Default Safety Lead Time** field on the **Manufacturing Setup** page and the related **Safety Lead Time** field on the **Item Card** page aren't included in transfer order calculations. However, the safety lead time does influence the total plan. The safety lead time affects the replenishment order (purchase or production) at the beginning of the transfer chain. That's the point where the items were put in the location from which they'll be transferred.  

![Elements of the transfer due date.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers14.png "Elements of the transfer due date")  

On the production order line, the Ending Date + Safety Lead Time + Inbound Warehouse Handling Time = Due Date.  

On the purchase order line, the Planned Receipt Date + Safety Lead Time + Inbound Warehouse Handling Time = Expected Receipt Date.  

## Reschedule  

When you reschedule a transfer line, the planning system finds the outbound part and changes the date-time.

> [!NOTE]
> If a lead time is defined, there'll be a gap between the shipment and the receipt. The lead time can consist of more elements, such as transportation time and warehouse handling time. On a time line, the planning system moves back in time while it balances the elements.  

![Changing the due date in transfer planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers15.png "Changing the due date in transfer planning")  

When you change the due date on a transfer line, the lead time must be calculated to update the outbound side of the transfer.  

## Serial and lot numbers in transfer chains  

If the demand uses serial or lot numbers, and you run the planning engine, it will create transfer orders. For more information about this concept, see Item Attributes. However, if serial or lot numbers are removed from the demand, the transfer orders still use the serial or lot numbers and planning will ignore them (not deleted).  

## Order-to-order links  

In this example, the BLUE SKU is set up with an **Order** reordering policy. The PINK and RED SKUs have the **Lot-for-Lot** reordering policy. Creating a sales order for 27 at location RED leads to a chain of transfers. The last transfer is at location BLUE, and it's reserved with binding. In this example, the reservations aren't hard reservations created by the planner at PINK location. The planning system creates the bindings. The important difference is that the planning system can change the latter.  

![Order-to-order links in transfer planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers16.png "Order-to-order links in transfer planning")  

If the demand is changed from 27 to 22, the planning system will lower the quantity through the chain. The binding reservation is also reduced.

# Add extended text

Use extended texts to communicate additional information for items, stock-keeping units, general ledger accounts, project planning lines, and resources. For example, the extra details might be about special prices, terms, or handling instructions. Provide the information by adding extra lines as extended text. You can also set up conditions for use of the extra lines.  

The following section describes how to add extended text to a description of an item. The same steps apply to stock-keeping units, general ledger accounts, project planning lines, and resources.  

## To define extended text for a description

1. Open the card for an item that you want to add extended text to, and then choose the **Extended Text** action.
2. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.
3. Choose the **New**.
4. Fill in the **Language Code** field, or turn on the **All Language Codes** toggle if you use language codes.
5. Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields if you want to limit the dates on which the extended text is used.
6. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Text** field, enter the extended text.
7. On the **Sales**, **Purchases**, and **Service** FastTabs, turn on the toggles for the documents you want to include the extended text.
8. Close the page.

You can now add this extended text to documents. The following procedure explains how to add extended text to a sales order, but the same steps apply to any other document that you specified for the extended text.  

## To add an extended item text on a sales order line

1. Open a sales order that has a sales line for an item with extended text. To learn more, go to [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
2. Select the line, and then choose the **Insert Ext. Text** action.

# Publish a web service

Web services are a lightweight way to make application functionality available to different kinds of external systems and users. By default, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] exposes several objects as web services for better integration with other Microsoft services. You can add other web services as your business requires.  

Set up a web service in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and then publish the web service so that it's available to authenticated users. All authorized users can access metadata for web services, but only users who have sufficient permissions can access actual data.  

## Creating and Publishing a Web Service

The following steps explain how to create and publish a web service.  

### To create and publish a web service  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Web Services**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Web Services** page, choose **New**. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > **Codeunit** and **Page** are valid types for SOAP web services. **Page** and **Query** are valid types for OData web services. Starting with version 16.3, **Codeunit** is also a valid type for OData v4 web services, but then no URL is shown in the user interface. 
    > Also, if the database contains multiple companies, you can choose an object ID that is specific to one of the companies.  
    > Finally, the service name is visible to consumers of your web service and is the basis for identifying and distinguishing web services, so you should make the name meaningful.

3. Select the check box in the **Published** column.  

When you publish the web service, the **OData URL** and **SOAP URL** fields show the new URLs. However, for codeunits that are exposed as OData v4 unbound actions, the URL fields aren't shown.  

You can test the web service immediately by choosing the links in the **OData URL** and **SOAP URL** fields. Optionally, copy the value of the field and save it for later use. To test codeunits that are exposed as OData v4 unbound actions, follow the instructions in the [Verifying web service availability](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-creating-and-interacting-with-odatav4-unbound-action#verifying-web-service-availability) section in the developer content.

> [!NOTE]
> If the objects that you expose as web services must not be accessible from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you must mark the methods exposed in the code as `[Scope('OnPrem')]`. For more information, see [Scope Attribute](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods/devenv-scope-attribute).

After you publish a web service, it's available to external parties. You can verify the availability of that web service by using a browser, or choose the link in the **OData URL** and **SOAP URL** fields on the **Web Services** page. The following procedure illustrates how you can verify the availability of the web service for later use.  

### To verify the availability of a web service  

1. In your browser, enter the relevant URL. The following table illustrates the types of URLs that you can enter for different web service types.  

    > [!div class="mx-tdBreakAll"]
    > |Type|Syntax|Example|
    > |----------------|------|-------|
    > |SOAP|`https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/*version*/*tenant*/Production/WS/*CompanyName*/*entity*/` |`https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/7acc9d3d-d354-4616-8bbd-c4fc9f2b15b3/Production/WS/CRONUS%20USA%2C%20Inc./Page/InvoiceDocument`|
    > |OData V4|`https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/*version*/*tenant*/Production/ODataV4/Company('*CompanyName*')/*entity*`|`https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/7acc9d3d-d354-4616-8bbd-c4fc9f2b15b3/Production/ODataV4/Company('CRONUS%20USA%2C%20Inc.')/InvoiceDocument`<br/>    The company name is case-sensitive.|

2. Review the information that is displayed in the browser. Verify that you can see the name of the web service that you created.  

When you access a web service, and you want to write data back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify the company name. You can specify the company as part of the URI as shown in the examples; alternatively, specify the company as part of the query parameters. For example, the following URIs point to the same OData web service and are both valid URIs.  

```
https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v1.0/OData/Company('CRONUS International Ltd.')/Customer  
```

```
https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v1.0/OData/Customer?company='CRONUS International Ltd.'  
```

title: Using Word templates for bulk communications
description: Word templates can make it easy to bulk create documents that are personalized for specific entities.

# Use Word templates for bulk communication

Microsoft Word templates can make it easier to mass communicate in print or by email with contacts, customers, and vendors. For example, you can create:

* Brochures to alert customers about a sales campaign
* Letters to inform vendors about a new purchasing policy
* Invitations to attract contacts to an upcoming event

> [!NOTE]
> When you set up Word templates, you must use a device with Microsoft Word 2019 or newer and have the Windows operating system installed.

## Set up the source of data

Use entities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as the source of data for the template, and add merge fields to personalize documents for each entity. The merge fields come from the entity in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you apply a Word template to an entity, data from the merge fields is inserted in the document.

On the **Word Templates** page, when you create a new template an assisted setup guide helps you through the following steps:

1. Choose one or more entities to use as the source of the data. For example, if you want to create a brochure for a sales campaign, you'd probably choose the Customer entity as the source.
2. Choose other entities as extra sources of data. Learn more at [Add Entries that are Related or Unrelated to the Source Entity](#add-entries-that-are-related-or-unrelated-to-the-source-entity).
3. Download a blank template. You can set up the template in Word right away, or you can upload the blank template and finish the guide. When your template's ready, use the **Upload** action on the **Word Templates** page to replace the blank template with your finished template. Learn more at [Set Up the Template in Word](#set-up-the-template-in-word).
4. Upload the template you prepared.
5. Enter a code and a name that identifies the template.

When you download a template, you get a .zip file that includes two files.

|File  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|DataSource.xlsx     | The data source file provides the fields that you can use in the template. Don't edit the data source file. You can only use the Word template and data source files that you download and you must store the files in the same location.     |
|Word template     | A .docx file to use as the template.        |

To learn about setting up a template in Word, go to [Set Up the Template in Word](#set-up-the-template-in-word).

## Add entries that are related or unrelated to the source entity

You can also merge data from other entities. To add other entities as data sources, use one of the following actions on the **Word Templates** page or when you're using the assisted setup guide:

|Action  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Add related entity**  | Use data from entities that are related to the source entity. For example, for the Customer entity you can also merge data from the Contact entity. Entities are related when a field on one entity refers to another. A field on the Customer entity refers to a field on the Contact entity, so they're related. The shared field is often an identifier such as a name, code, or ID.        |
|**Add unrelated entity**| Use data from entities that aren't related to the source entity. For example, you're creating a template for the Customer entity. You might add the Company Information entity so you can include your contact details. A key benefit is that if you change your contact information, it automatically updates in your template. After you add an unrelated entity, you can add entities that are related to it.         |

For unrelated entries, you choose a specific record. Because you can only add an entity one time, to use a different record you must delete the entity and add it again with the new record.

You can create a hierarchy of entities, both related and unrelated. The relation is shown as a tree structure. The **Entity relation** field also shows information about the relation. For unrelated entities, the field shows the record that creates the relation.

When you add entities, use the **Field Prefix** field to specify a prefix for the field names. Later, when you add fields to the template, the prefix helps distinguish between fields from the source and other entities.

### Select the fields to include

For each entity, you can specify the fields that you want to be available for the template. Choose the number in the **Number of Selected fields** column to access a list of fields that are available. On the **Field Selection** page, use the **Include** checkbox to specify the fields. For some entities, fields that businesses typically use are included by default. You can edit the list, for example, to remove the default fields. Your changes apply only to the template you're working on.

> [!NOTE]
> The total number of fields that you can add from all entities is 250.

> [!NOTE]
> You or your Microsoft partner can add custom fields to entities. When you do, we prefix the name of the fields with **CALC** and give them the field type **Calculated**. The field type is called calculated to indicate the field can show different types of values, such as text, numbers, dates, and so on.

## To create a Word template in Business Central

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Word Templates**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **New**, then **Create a Template**, and then follow the steps in the assisted setup guide. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> You can also create a template directly from the page for an entity by choosing the **Apply Word Template** action to open the assisted setup guide, and then **New Template**. When you do, the data source is chosen for you based on the type of entity.

## Set up the template in Word

When you're setting up a template in Word, on the **Mailings** tab you can add merge fields by choosing **Insert Merge Field**. The merge fields come from the data source file that you downloaded for the entity. They act as placeholders that tell Word where in the document to put the information about the entity.

:::image type="content" source="media/word-tmpl-merge-field.PNG" alt-text="Adding merge fields in Microsoft Word":::

## Apply a template

When your Word template is ready, on the **Word Templates** page you can choose **Apply** to generate the documents. When you apply a Word template to an entity, data from the merge fields is inserted in the document. You can either create one document that contains sections for each entity, or choose **Split** to create a new document for each entity.

You can use the **Apply Word Templates** action to apply templates to one or more of the same type of entity, such as a customer, directly in the context of the page for the entity. For example, the **Customer** or **Vendor** pages.

## Use Word templates with email

You can use Word templates to add content to email messages. When you compose an email, you can choose the **Use Word Template** action to apply the content of a template to the message. You must already have templates for the entity. You can use one template at a time, and when you switch between templates the message changes to reflect the content from the chosen template.

Additionally, you can use the **Add File from Word Template** action to attach the content of the template to the email as a file. The file uses the format you specified for the template output.

:::image type="content" source="media/email-word-tmpl.PNG" alt-text="Options for using content from a Word template in an email":::

# Bookmark a page or report on your role center

Using the bookmark icon, you can add an action that opens a page or report from the navigation menu of your role center. Bookmarks allow you to quickly reach your favorite content or business tasks. You add the bookmark from the target page or report, meaning the screen that you want the link on the role center to open.

The bookmark icon is shown in the top-right corner of a page and also in the **Tell Me** window where you can efficiently bookmark multiple pages or reports. If a bookmark already exists for the page, then the icon is dark, and the tooltip says "Bookmarked".

## Bookmark the target page

1. Open any page that you want a link for on your role center.
2. Choose the ![Bookmark.](media/ui_bookmark_icon.png "Bookmark") icon.

An action named after the page is now added to the navigation menu on your role center.

## Bookmark the target report

1. Open any report request page that you want a link for on your role center.
2. Choose the ![Bookmark.](media/ui_bookmark_icon.png "Bookmark") icon.

An action named after the report is now added to the navigation menu on your role center.

## Bookmark a page or report from the Tell Me window

1. Open the **Tell Me** window and enter, for example, **Sales Orders**.
2. Hover over the search result for the **Sales Orders** page or report, and then choose the ![Bookmark.](media/ui_bookmark_icon.png "Bookmark") icon.

An action named after the page or report is now added to the navigation menu on your role center.

## Frequently asked questions  

### Can I reorganize my bookmarks?

Yes. You can personalize your role center and move actions into a more optimal sequence or move them into existing groups or subgroups.  
Learn how to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

### How do I remove a bookmark?

On the target page or report, choose the bookmark icon again to remove the involved action from your role center. You can also personalize your role center and temporarily hide actions without fully removing them.

### Where do I find my bookmarks?

When adding a bookmark to a page or report, the new action is added to the top navigation menu on your current home screen (role center). If you happen to have many actions, you may need to activate the **More** button to display all of them because the new action is always appended at the end of those actions.
<!-- Should we add a screenshot here? -->

### I don't have a bookmark icon. Is something wrong?

The ability to bookmark a page or report is one of many user personalization features in Business Central. If the bookmark icon isn't displayed, it's likely that your administrator has disabled personalization.

### Why can't I bookmark certain pages or reports?

Not all pages and reports can be bookmarked. When a page or report is run within some special context governed by the business application, the bookmark icon isn't displayed. For example, pages that cannot be found in the **Tell Me** window but are launched from elsewhere will not display a bookmark icon. Similarly, report request pages that are only used to collect filters without running the report will not display a bookmark icon.

  See technical details about [RunRequestPage](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods-auto/report/reportinstance-runrequestpage-method) and [FilterPageBuilder](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods-auto/filterpagebuilder/filterpagebuilder-data-type).

### When clearing my personalization, will my bookmarks also be cleared?

Yes. Bookmarks reside in the navigation menu. If you clear changes to the navigation menu from any page, or clear all personalization on the role center, all your new actions will be permanently removed.

### Why does the bookmark icon continue to indicate it's still not bookmarked?

When you add a bookmark, the new action is added to the navigation menu on the role center and subsequent visits to the page or report show a dark bookmark icon. If you personalize your role center and reorganize your actions by moving them into groups, the bookmark icon will no longer be dark and you can add another bookmark to that same page or report. This allows you to add multiple actions to the same page or report and categorize them into different groups.

### Why does my link to a report display a different report?

Some reports may be substituted by other reports after applying an extension to Business Central. When substitution occurs, the text of the new action isn't updated and will continue to display the name of the original report, but navigate to the newer report. To correct the text of the new action, you can remove the new action and add it again.
<!-- For more information on report substitution, see this link UNAVAILABLE AT THIS TIME -->

### Is bookmarking available for XMLports?

No. At this time, adding actions to open XMLports isn't possible from the user interface.

### Will my bookmarks be translated when I change my language in Business Central?

When you add a new action, any translated text that was available at the time is used when bookmarking. If new translated text is added later, then the new action will not include the newer translations.

### Why can't I add text in a page right after opening it with the bookmark?

When a page is bookmarked, the page will always open in the view mode from the bookmark&mdash;even if it was in the edit mode when it was bookmarked. Selecting the **Make changes on the page** icon ![Shows the pencil icon for editing the page.](media/edit-pencil.png) will let you add text in the fields that are editable.

title: Why a Page is Locked from Personalization
description: You might be blocked from personalizing a page. Read here about what you can do to unlock it so you can personalize it.

# Why a Page is Locked from Personalization

There are two conditions that prevent you from personalizing a page. Either the page is locked (as indicated by the ![Personalize Lock.](media/personalization-lock-icon.png "Personalize lock")) icon or it's blocked (as indicated by the ![Personalization blocked.](media/personalization-blocked-icon.png "Personalization blocked") icon).

## Locked from Personalizing

If there's a ![Personalize Lock.](media/personalization-lock-icon.png "Personalize lock") icon in the **Personalizing** banner when you open a page, you're currently prevented from making any more personalization changes to the page.

<!-- This is because we changed the way personalization works behind the scenes since the last time that you personalized the page. Unfortunately, the old way and new of doing things do not work together.

The page currently includes the last personalization changes that you made. If you want to continue personalizing the page, then you can choose the lock icon and then **Unlock**. Just be aware that if you choose to unlock the page, the current personalization of the page will be cleared, and you will have to start from scratch.
-->

There can be two reasons:

1. You've personalized the page before, but it was done using an earlier version of the product. We changed the way personalization works behind the scenes since the last time that you personalized the page. Unfortunately, the old way and new way of doing things don't work together.

2. Until now, you've only used the bow deprecated [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] to personalize the page.

### Unlocking the Page

If you want to unlock a page and continue personalizing it, choose the ![Personalize Lock](media/personalization-lock-icon.png "Personalize lock") icon, and then choose the **Unlock** action.  

> [!CAUTION]
> The current personalization of the page will be cleared. The page will go back to its original layout, and you'll have to start from scratch.  

## Blocked from Personalizing

If there's a ![Personalization blocked](media/personalization-blocked-icon.png "Personalization blocked") icon in the **Personalizing** banner, you're blocked from doing any personalization to the page.

<!-- Only text is translated, so removing this image for non-English UX reasons.  ![Personalize blocked.](media/personalization-blocked.png "Personalize lock") -->

The reason is that the Role Center or role that is currently associated with your user account modifies this page specifically for your role. Contact your administrator for assistance. Alternatively, try switching to a Role Center that does include role-tailoring for this page. For more information, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).

# FAQ for marketing text suggestions with Copilot

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the [!INCLUDE[feature-marketing-text-suggestions](includes/feature-marketing-text-suggestions.md)] feature in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What is item marketing text suggestions?

Copilot provides writing assistance for users responsible for authoring marketing text (also known as copy) on items in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This feature is known as [!INCLUDE[feature-marketing-text-suggestions](includes/feature-marketing-text-suggestions.md)]. The [!INCLUDE[feature-marketing-text-suggestions](includes/feature-marketing-text-suggestions.md)] feature provides writing assistance for users responsible for authoring marketing text (also known as *copy*) on items in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The feature is available on any item card in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To use it, just open an item and then select **Marketing Text** > **Draft with Copilot**. This action automatically generates a text suggestion that's engaging, creative, and specific to the item that's shown. Suggestions are based on various inputs, including:

- The item's attributes, category, and name.
- Personal writing style preferences, like tone of voice, emphasized quality, format and length.

You can change the value of these input options to influence the outcome of the AI-generated text. Before you save a suggestion, you can easily review and edit it for accuracy or try another suggestion.

Some key benefits of this feature include:

- Decreases the time used on copy writing, which can accelerate time-to-market for items being sold in online shops.
- Unlocks creativity to provide more engaging product descriptions.
- Improves consistency of marketing material for product lines.

## What are the system's capabilities?

The [!INCLUDE[feature-marketing-text-suggestions](includes/feature-marketing-text-suggestions.md)] feature uses Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service to access powerful language models that analyze and generate natural language. These models have been trained on a wide body of text datasets. As a result, Copilot can generate suggested, personalized responses in English based on a minimal amount of input data, like an item's attributes, category, or description. Learn more about Azure OpenAI Service at [Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview).

## What is the system's intended use?

This feature is intended to assist users in creating marketing text for items in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Writers use the feature to quickly get compelling and engaging text suggestions, which are then reviewed and edited for accuracy. 

## How was item marketing text evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

- The feature underwent extensive testing where numerous texts in different languages were evaluated by language experts against various criteria. Testing was based on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s demonstration data and other fictitious product catalogs.
- This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft at [Empowering responsible AI practices](https://aka.ms/RAI).

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content?

Microsoft has various systems in place to ensure Copilot capabilities remain operational and generate content of the highest quality.

- Users have the opportunity to provide feedback to report inappropriate content and improve the functionality.

# Reconcile bank accounts

Bank reconciliation helps ensure that what's in your books matches the statements you receive from your bank. Bank account reconciliation compares and matches entries in the bank accounts you set up in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with bank transactions at your bank. Reconciliation can then post the balances to your bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to make them available to finance managers. Bank reconciliation is also a practical way to discover missing payments and resolve bookkeeping errors.

This article describes how to reconcile bank accounts from the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.

However, you can also reconcile bank accounts on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page when you process payments. Open bank account ledger entries related to the applied customer or vendor ledger entries close when you choose the **Post Payments and Reconcile Bank Account** action. This action automatically reconciles the bank account for the payments that you post with the journal. Learn more in [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> The North American versions offers the **Bank Rec. Worksheet** page, which is better suited for checks and deposits but doesn't let you import bank statement files. To use this page instead of the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, clear the **Bank Recon. with Auto. Match** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page. Learn more in [Reconciling Bank Accounts](LocalFunctionality/UnitedStates/how-to-reconcile-bank-accounts.md) under United States Local Functionality.

The lines on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page are divided into two panes. The **Bank Statement Lines** pane shows either imported bank transactions or ledger entries with outstanding payments. The **Bank Account Ledger Entries** pane shows the ledger entries in the internal bank account.

## About bank reconciliation

Reconciling transactions in statements from your bank with bank entries in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is referred to as *matching*. There are three ways to match transactions with bank entries:

* Automatically, by using the **Match Automatically** action.
* Automatically, by using the **Reconcile with Copilot** action.

  This action is available as part of the bank reconciliation assist (preview) feature, which an AI-powered feature. Learn more in [Reconcile bank accounts with Copilot](bank-reconciliation-with-copilot.md).
* Manually, by selecting lines in both panes to link each bank statement line to one or more bank account ledger entries, and then using the **Match Manually** action.

The **Applied** checkbox is selected on lines where entries match. Learn more in [Set Up Rules for Automatic Application of Payments](receivables-how-set-up-payment-application-rules.md). If you enter a statement ending date on the bank reconciliation after you match its lines with entries, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will undo the matches for lines and entries that are after that date.

> [!NOTE]
> After you enter a date in the **Statement Date** field, the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page filters the bank ledger entries to show only entries up to that date. You can only post bank reconciliations with bank ledger entries on or before the statement ending date. The filter ensures that your bank ledger is balanced with your bank statement on the statement ending date, with the difference being the outstanding payments and checks.

When the value in the **Total Balance** field in the **Bank Statement Lines** pane equals the total value of the **Balance To Reconcile** field plus the **Balance Last Statement** field in the **Bank Account Ledger Entries** pane, you can choose the **Post** action. Unmatched bank account ledger entries remain on the page, indicating discrepancies that you should resolve to reconcile the bank account.

Any lines that can't be matched, indicated by a value in the **Difference** field, will remain on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page after posting. They represent some kind of discrepancy that you must resolve before you can complete the bank account reconciliation. The following table describes a few typical business situations that can cause differences.

| Difference | Reason | Resolution |
|------------|--------|------------|
| A transaction in your bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] isn't in the bank statement. | The bank transaction wasn't created although a posting was made in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. | Create the missing transaction (or prompt a debitor to make it). Then reimport the bank statement file or enter the transaction manually. |
| A transaction on the bank statement doesn't exist as a document or journal line in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. | A bank transaction was made without a corresponding posting in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], for example a journal line posting for an expense. | Create and post the missing entry. Learn more about a quick way in [To create missing ledger entries to match bank transactions with](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md#to-create-missing-ledger-entries-to-match-bank-statement-lines). |
| A transaction in the internal bank account corresponds to a bank transaction but some information is too different to give a match. | Information, such as the amount or the customer name, was entered differently in the bank transaction or the internal posting. | Review the information, and then manually match the two. Optionally, correct the mismatch. |

You must resolve the differences. For example, create the missing entries and correct unmatched information until you can complete and post the bank account reconciliation.

You can fill in the **Bank Statement Lines** pane on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page in the following ways:

* Automatically, by using the **Import Bank Statement** function to fill in the **Bank Statement Lines** pane with bank transactions according to an imported file or stream provided by the bank.
* Manually, by using the **Suggest Lines** function to fill in the **Bank Statement Lines** pane according to invoices in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that have outstanding payments.

## Add bank statement lines by importing a bank statement

The **Bank Statement Lines** pane shows bank transactions according to an imported file or stream provided by the bank.

To import bank statements as bank feeds, you must set up the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feed service. The setup includes linking your bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to the related online bank accounts. Learn more in [Set Up the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds Service](bank-how-setup-bank-statement-service.md).  

> [!TIP]
> You can also import bank statement files in comma or semicolon delimited format (.CSV). Use the **Set up a bank statement file format** assisted setup to define bank statement import formats and attach the format to a bank account. You can then use these formats when you import bank statements in the **Bank Account Reconciliation** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Account Reconciliation**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. In the **Bank Account No.** field, select the relevant bank account. The bank account ledger entries that exist on the bank account appear in the **Bank Account Ledger Entries** pane.
4. In the **Statement Date** field, enter the date of the statement from the bank.
5. In the **Statement Ending Balance** field, enter the balance of the statement from the bank.
6. If you have a bank statement file, choose the **Import Bank Statement** action.
7. Locate the file, and then choose the **Open** button to import the bank transactions into the **Bank Statement Lines** pane on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.

## To fill in bank reconciliation lines with the Suggest Lines action

The **Bank Statement Lines** pane is filled in according to invoices in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that have outstanding payments.  

1. On the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, choose the **Suggest Lines** action.
2. In the **Starting Date** field, enter the earliest posting date for the ledger entries to be reconciled.
3. In the **Ending Date** field, enter the latest posting date for the ledger entries to be reconciled.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Typically, the ending date will match the date specified in the **Statement Date** field. However, if you want to reconcile transactions for only part of a period, you can enter a different ending date.

4. If you don't want the bank account ledger entries to include unmatched open reversed entries, choose the **Exclude Reversed Entries** toggle. By default, the list of bank account ledger entries include reversed entries up to the statement date.
5. Choose the **OK** button.

## Match bank statement lines with bank account ledger entries automatically

The **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page offers automatic matching functionality based on a matching of text on a bank statement line (left pane) with text on one or more bank account ledger entries (right pane). You can overwrite the suggested automatic matching, and you can choose to not use automatic matching at all. Learn more in [Match bank statement lines with bank account ledger entries manually](#match-bank-statement-lines-with-bank-account-ledger-entries-manually).

You can investigate the basis for matches by using the **Match Details** action. For example, the details include the names of the fields that contained matching values.  

1. On the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, choose the **Match Automatically**. The **Match Bank Entries** page opens.
2. In the **Transaction Date Tolerance (Days)** field, specify the span of days before and after the bank account ledger entry posting date within which the action searches for matching transaction dates in the bank statement.

    If you enter 0 or leave the field blank, the **Match Automatically** action only searches for matching transaction dates on the bank account ledger entry posting date.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

    The lines are color coded to make it easier to understand what to do with them. Bank statement lines and bank account ledger entries that are matched on the current bank reconciliation change to bold green font. Bank account ledger entries that are matched on other bank reconciliations are shown in italic blue font.
4. To remove a match, select the bank statement line, and then choose the **Remove Match** action.

> [!TIP]
> You can use a mix of manual and automatic matching. If you have manually matched entries, automatic matching will not overwrite your selections.

## Match bank statement lines with bank account ledger entries manually

> [!TIP]
> When matching lines and entries manually, the **Show All**, **Show Reversed Entries**, **Hide Reversed Entries**, and **Show Nonmatched** actions can make it easier to get an overview. By default, the bank account ledger entries don't include unmatched reversed entries. To include these entries in the list and match them manually, choose the **Show Reversed Entries** action. If you choose to hide reversed entries after you've made one or more matches, the matched entries are still shown.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't post a bank reconciliation if you do many-to-one matching and the combined amounts contain differences. This is true even if the combined differences balance to zero.
>
> Here's an example of a many-to-one matching that has differences. The value of 200 for bank statement entry 1 is matched to two bank ledger entries that have a total value of 180. The difference is 20. The value of 350 for bank statement 2 is matched to two other bank ledger entries that have a total value of 370. The difference is -20, which balances the value of 20 for bank statement 1.  
>
> To post a bank reconciliation with differences on the lines, post the differences and then match them against the posted entries.

1. On the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, select an unapplied line in the **Bank Statement Lines** pane.
2. In the **Bank Account Ledger Entries** pane, select one or more banks account ledger entries that can be matched with the selected bank statement line. To choose multiple lines, select and hold the CTRL key, and then choose the lines.

   > [!TIP]
   > You can also manually match multiple bank statement lines with one bank account ledger entry. For example, this might be useful if your bank deposit contained several payment methods, such as credit cards from different issuers, and your bank lists those as separate lines.
3. Choose the **Match Manually** action.

    The selected bank statement line and the selected bank account ledger entries change to green font, and the **Applied** checkbox in the right pane is selected.
4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 for all bank statement lines that aren't matched.

> [!TIP]
> To remove a match, select the bank statement line, and then choose the **Remove Match** action. If you have matched multiple bank statement lines to a ledger entry, and need to remove one or more of the matched lines, all of the manual matches are removed for the ledger entry when you choose **Remove Match**.

## Validate your bank reconciliation

To double-check your bank account reconciliation before you post it, use the **Test Report** action to preview the reconciliation. The report is available in the following contexts:

* When you're preparing a bank reconciliation on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.
* When you're reconciling payments on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page.

Lines that can't be matched stay on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page after posting. These lines contain a value in the **Difference** field. The difference represents a discrepancy that you must resolve before you can complete the bank account reconciliation. The following table describes a few typical business situations that can cause differences.

| Difference | Reason | Resolution |
|------------|--------|------------|
| A transaction in your bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] isn't in the bank statement. | The bank transaction wasn't created although a posting was made in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. | Create the missing transaction (or prompt a debitor to make it). Then reimport the bank statement file or enter the transaction manually. |
| A transaction on the bank statement doesn't exist as a document or journal line in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. | A bank transaction was made without a corresponding posting in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], for example a journal line posting for an expense. | Create and post the missing entry. Learn more about a quick way in [To create missing ledger entries to match bank transactions with](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md#to-create-missing-ledger-entries-to-match-bank-statement-lines). |
| A transaction in the internal bank account corresponds to a bank transaction but some information is too different to give a match. | Information, such as the amount or the customer name, was entered differently in the bank transaction or the internal posting. | Review the information, and then manually match the two. Optionally, correct the mismatch. |

You must resolve the differences. For example, create the missing entries and correct unmatched information until you can complete and post the bank account reconciliation.

> [!NOTE]
> The Bank Reconciliation page and Test Report assume you're only reconciling within the period up until the statement ending date. If you match a bank statement line to a bank ledger entry before you enter a statement ending date, and then enter a statement ending date that is after the ending date for the bank ledger entry, the data in the Test Report will be incorrect.

The following table describes fields on the Test Report that can help you complete the bank reconciliation.

|Field  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Statement Date| The date specified in the **Statement Date** field on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.|
|Balance Last Statement|The balance specified in the **Balance Last Statement** field on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page. This field is filled in automatically from the most recent reconciliation for the same bank account. The value is zero if it's is your first bank account reconciliation.|
|Statement Ending Balance|The balance specified in the **Statement Ending Balance** field on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page. |
|G/L Account No. <*number*> Balance at <*date*> | The balance on the G/L account on the statement ending date. This value is the unfiltered balance as of that date. If your bank uses your local currency, this balance should be the same as your bank account balance (shown on the right side of the report header) when you match all statement lines. An empty **()** in the name of this field means that your bank uses local currency.<br><br>A discrepancy in this field and the previous ones might indicate that you posted directly to the G/L account. It might also indicate that you're using the same G/L account for multiple banks, which we don't recommend. Banks are linked to the general ledger through the bank account posting group specified for the account.<br><br>The Test Report shows a warning if you have direct postings, even if the balance for the posting is zero. Direct postings that aren't balanced often lead to accumulated differences for future bank reconciliations. You should check the general ledger balance and ledger entries before you post the bank reconciliation. Learn more in about direct posting in [Avoid Direct Posting](#avoid-direct-posting).|
|G/L Account No. <*number*> Balance (<*LCY*>) at <*date*>| The balance on the G/L account on the statement ending date in local currency. The balance is converted to the bank account's currency using the exchange rate that was valid on the statement ending date. This value is the unfiltered balance as of that date. You compare to this balance to the **G/L Account No. <*number*> Balance at <*date*>* field if your bank uses a foreign currency. The value in the G/L Account No. <*number*> Balance at <*date*> field for local currency might differ slightly because currency conversion can result in small differences. Your bank's balance should be very close to this balance.  |
|Bank Account Balance at <*date*>| The balance on the bank account at the statement ending date.|
|Sum of Differences    | The sum of the differences for the statement lines. To access the details, turn on the **Print Outstanding Transactions** toggle when you enter criteria for the report. A difference is a bank statement line that isn't matched completely to one or more bank ledger entries. You can't post a bank account reconciliation that has differences. You can post a bank reconciliation that contains bank ledger entries that aren't matched to statement lines. This value is shown in the **Outstanding Bank Transactions** field and in a separate section if you turn on the Print Outstanding Transactions toggle.      |
|Statement Balance     | The value specified in the **Statement Ending Balance** field on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.  |
|Outstanding Bank Transactions     | The sum of unmatched, non-check bank ledger entries that have a posting date on or before the statement ending date. This happens when you register transactions before they're registered in your bank. For example, at the end of a period. When you create the next bank reconciliation, you can reconcile these entries.        |
|Outstanding Checks     | The sum of unmatched bank ledger entries for checks that have a posting date on or before the statement ending date. This happens when you register transactions before they're registered in your bank. For example, this can happen for checks if a vendor doesn't cash a check in the same period you registered it. When you create the next bank reconciliation, you can reconcile these entries.        |
|Bank Account Balance     | The sum of the values for the bank statement ending balance, outstanding bank transactions, and outstanding checks. After you handle all differences on matched entries, this balance matches your bank balance. For example, you accounted for all matched entries and the entries you couldn't match for this bank statement. You can post the reconciliation.        |

> [!TIP]
> If you run the **Test Report** from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the value in the **Statement Ending Balance** as follows:
>
> * balance last statement + sum of all lines in the payment reconciliation journal
>
> You can use the value to compare to your bank statement.

## To create missing ledger entries to match bank statement lines

Sometimes bank statement contains amounts for interest or fees charged. Such bank statement lines can't be matched because there aren't related ledger entries in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You must then post a journal line for each transaction to create a related ledger entry that it can be matched with.

1. On the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, choose the **Transfer to General Journal** action.  
2. On the **Trans. Bank Rec. to Gen. Jnl.** page, specify which general journal to use, and then choose the **OK** button.

    The **General Journals** page opens with new journal lines for any banks statement lines that are missing ledger entries.
3. Complete the journal line with information such as the balancing account. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).  
4. To review the result of posting before you post, choose the **Test Report** action, and then choose an option for accessing the report. The **Bank Account Statement** report shows the same fields as at the header of the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.
5. Choose the **Post** action.

    After the entry is posted, match the bank statement line to it.
6. Refresh or reopen the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page. The new ledger entry appears in the **Bank Account Ledger Entries** pane.
7. Match the bank statement line with the bank account ledger entry, either manually or automatically.

## Find outstanding transactions in previous periods

You can use the Bank Statement report to find outstanding transactions in previous periods. Outstanding transactions were opened before the statement date and aren't closed, or were closed after the bank reconciliation was posted.

When you run the Bank Statement report from the **Bank Account Statement List** page, you can turn on the **Outstanding Entries** toggle, and the report includes a section that lists outstanding entries.

**Example**
We have bank account ledger entries A, B, and C in our bank account for the month of August. When we reconcile our bank account for August we find a bank statement line that matches entry A, but none for B and C. So we post the reconciliation with entry A reconciled and B and C as outstanding entries.

In September, we receive a payment for entry B and decide to reconcile our bank account. If we run the Bank Statement report before posting the reconciliation, we get one reconciled transaction and one outstanding.

If we print the report for August we get outstanding transactions for our B and C entries, even though we closed entry B in September.

> [!NOTE]
> The Bank Statement report has some known limitations if you import or manually enter bank transactions after you post a bank reconciliation.
>
> You can enter bank ledger entries on any date and with any posting date, so you don't always have to do it in a strict chronological order.. When you do a bank reconciliation, you reconcile a bank statement to the bank ledger entries you have registered up to the time you post the reconciliation, and with the posting date of the entries. Typically, that means a posting date on or before the statement ending date.
>
> When you post a bank reconciliation, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] takes a snapshot of the data and uses it to fill in the bank statement report's header. But, the outstanding transactions sections are actual lookups to the bank ledger entries that existed up to the actual date and time you posted the bank reconciliation. The totals in the lines typically match the totals in the header. However, if you import bank ledger entries after you posted the bank reconciliation, but the posting dates are before the statement ending date, the totals in the header might not match the totals in the outstanding transactions sections.

## Undo a bank account reconciliation

If you find a mistake in a posted bank reconciliation, you can use the **Undo** action on the **Bank Account Statement List** page to correct it. When you undo a posted bank reconciliation, the entries are moved to the **Bank Account Reconciliations** page and marked as **Open**, meaning they aren't reconciled. You can then correct the bank reconciliation and post it again.

> [!NOTE]
> In the North American version, to use the Undo feature for posted bank reconciliations and bank statements you must turn on the **Bank Recon. with Auto-Match** toggle on the **General Ledger Setup** page. The Undo feature is not available for bank statements posted from bank reconciliation worksheets.

### Reusing the bank statement number

The bank statement number used for the new bank reconciliation is taken from the bank account as is the Balance Last Statement. You can change these values before you start a new bank reconciliation. However, when you create a new bank reconciliation, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] checks whether the statement number is already assigned to a posted bank statement. If the number is in use, but you want the new bank statement to use it instead, you can use the **Change Statement No.** action on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.

### Examples

The following examples show how to fix a mistake on a posted bank reconciliation, with or without using the same statement number.

#### Example 1

You did bank reconciliations for January, February, and March. The bank statement number was 100 for March. Later, you discover that March only included entries until the 30th, which means entries for the 31st are missing. So, you need to redo the bank reconciliation for March. In this case, we open the **Bank Account Statement List** page, choose the statement for March, and then choose **Undo**.

The new bank reconciliation is given the statement number 101. To reassign the number 100, choose **Change Statement No.** and enter **100**. 

> [!TIP]
> Remember to set the appropriate Statement ending date (in this example, that is March 31), and edit the **Balance Last Statement** field. 

#### Example 2

You did bank reconciliations for January, February, June, and July. You discover that February was incorrect. Let's assume it had statement number 100. Like Example 1, you use the Undo and Change Statement No. actions to change the statement number as in example #1 and you can now redo February bank reconciliation.  

After you post the corrected bank reconciliation for February, on the corresponding Bank Account card the **Last Statement No.** field will show **100**, and the **Balance Last Statement** field will show the ending balance for the February statement. 

If the next bank reconciliation you do is for March, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] will assign 101 as the statement number and give it the correct **Balance Last Statement**.

If the next bank reconciliation you do is for August, consider changing the values in the **Last Statement No.** and **Balance Last Statement** fields on the **Bank Account** card before you create the next bank reconciliation, or use the **Change Statement No.** action and also change the value in the **Balance Last Statement** field on the bank reconciliation page.

> [!NOTE]
> The statement number is important when you do bank reconciliations with imported CAMT files that contain statement numbers, or when you reconcile based on printed bank statements. If you just download a range of bank transactions from your online bank, the statement number is usually not important.  
>
> The Balance Last Statement is kept on the bank account to minimize mistakes when doing bank reconciliations, but it's also editable, allowing you to do your bank reconciliations in any order you want. This also means that if you undo a bank statement, the new ending balance might not be the balance last statement on the next bank statement. There's no feature that allows you to move a balance forward to all subsequent bank statements, so be aware of this when using Undo.  

## Avoid direct posting

Don't use a G/L account that allows direct posting in your bank account posting group. Direct posting breaks the connection between the bank account ledger entry and the G/L account ledger entry. When you reconcile your bank account, the entries posted directly to the G/L account aren't included, which makes it difficult to complete the reconciliation.

This mistake often happens when entering an opening balance for a bank account. It's important that you don't post the opening balance directly to the general ledger. Entries in the G/L account that are posted directly to the G/L account causes problems. For example, these entries might prevent you from reconciling your bank account. For foreign currency bank accounts, the entries can cause differences to accumulate after you post more bank reconciliations due to currency exchange rate adjustments. Often, you post the opening bank balance directly to the bank account, and the amount then ends up in the G/L account. Alternatively, you reverse it later against the G/L account that you use to balance the opening general ledger balance. In both cases, you must balance any direct posting to the G/L account before you start your first bank reconciliation, and especially so if the bank account is in a foreign currency.

# Set up validation of purchase amounts

> [!NOTE]
> Businesses around the world can benefit from this functionality, so in 2025 release wave 1 we moved it out of the Dutch version and made it available to everyone.

You can validate the total amount on purchase invoices and credit memos before you post the documents. You can turn on the **Check Doc. Total Amounts** toggle on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page. By default, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] validates the total amount when you post the document. The total amount of the purchase lines must equal the amount including VAT and the VAT amount. To validate the amount automatically, you must enter the document amount including VAT and the document amount VAT on the **Purchase Invoice** or **Purchase Credit Memo** page.  

If you have only one purchase line, or several purchase lines with the same VAT percentage, the correct document amount VAT is calculated automatically when you add the purchase lines and the document amount including VAT. If you have several purchase lines with different VAT percentages, you must manually change the document amount VAT value.  

If the total amount on the document differs from the total amount of its lines, you can add a few values to the page that can help you find out why. You can add the total amount, total base amount, total VAT amount, and total amount including VAT values. The values display at the bottom of the document. To avoid clutter on the page during daily work, these values are hidden. To add these values to the document, turn on the **Show Totals on Purch. Inv.-CM.** toggle on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page.  

You can turn on this option only if the purchase invoice or purchase credit memo has:  

- A minimum of one purchase line.  
- The quantity field specified.  

## To set up validation of total amounts for purchase documents  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Show Totals on Purch. Inv./CM.**|Recalculate the totals on all purchase invoices and credit memos. Depending on how many documents you have, the recalculation can take some time.|  
    |**Check Doc. Total Amounts**|Verify the **Doc. Amount Incl. VAT** and **Doc. Amount VAT** fields on the purchase invoices and credit memos.|  

3. Choose the **OK** button.

# Setting up cash flow analysis

If you want some help to decide what to do with your cash, have a look at the charts on the Accountant Role Center:

* **Cash Cycle**  
* **Income & Expense**  
* **Cash Flow**  
* **Cash Flow Forecasts**  

This article describes where the data in the charts comes from and, if necessary, what to do to start using the charts.
<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=4ecab63b-f107-4666-b88f-656a133a0f78]

## The Cash Cycle and Income & Expense charts

The **Cash Cycle** and **Income & Expense** charts are ready to go, based on the Chart of Accounts and financial reports. The accounts are where the data comes from, and financial reports calculate the relationship between sales and receivables. Some accounts and financial reports are provided. You can use them as-is, change them, and add new ones. If you add G/L accounts to your chart of accounts, for example, by importing them from QuickBooks, map the accounts on the **Financial Reports** page for the following reports:

| Financial report name | Where it's used |
| --- | --- |
| **I_CACYCLE** |Cash Cycle |
| **I_CASHFLOW** |Cash Flow |
| **I_INCEXP** |Income & Expense |
| **I_MINTRIAL** |As an income statement if you don't use the chart of accounts |

> [!NOTE]
> It's a good idea to keep the calculations that are provided for the financial report.

Enter accounts in the **Totaling** field for **Total Revenue**, **Total Receivables**, **Total Payables**, and **Total Inventory**. To map to a range of accounts, enter the account numbers separated by ".." as in **1111..4444**. Alternately, to map to specific accounts, enter the account numbers separated by a vertical bar as in **2222|3333|5555**.  

> [!TIP] 
> Verify your mapping by choosing the **Overview** action.  

## Set up the Cash Flow chart

The Cash Flow chart is based on:  

* A chart of cash flow accounts.
* One or more cash flow setups. These setups specify the accounts to use for general ledger, purchases, sales, services, and fixed assets.  

To help you get going, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides some accounts and cash flow setups. You can add, change, or remove them.  

To set up the accounts, search for **Chart of Cash Flow Accounts**, choose the link, and then fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Repeat these steps for **Cash Flow Setup**.

## Set up cash flow forecasts

The **Cash Flow Forecast** chart uses cash flow accounts, cash flow setups, and cash flow forecasts. Some are provided, however, you can set up your own by using an assisted setup guide. The guide helps you specify things like:

* When to update the forecast
* Which accounts to base it on
* When you pay taxes
* Whether to turn on [Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/ai-platform/).  

Cash flow forecasts can use Azure AI to create a more comprehensive forecast. The connection to Azure AI is already set up for you. You just need to turn it on. When you sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a notification displays in a blue bar and provides a link to the default cash flow setup. The notification displays only once. If you close it, but then decide to turn on Azure AI, you can use the assisted setup guide or a manual process.  

> [!NOTE]
>
> Alternatively, you can use your own predictive web service. For more information, see [Create and use your own predictive web service for cash flow forecasts](#AnchorText).  

To use the assisted setup guide:  

1. In the Accountant Role Center, under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart, choose the **Open Assisted Setup** action.
2. Fill in the fields in each step of the guide. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Back in the Accountant Role Center, choose the **Recalculate Forecast** action under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart.

To use a manual process:  

1. In the Accountant Role Center, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Flow Setup**, then choose the related link.
2. Expand the **Azure AI** FastTab, then choose the **Azure AI Enabled** field.
3. Back in the Accountant Role Center, choose the **Recalculate Forecast** action under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart.

> [!TIP]  
> Consider the length of the periods that the service will use in its calculations. The more data you provide, the more accurate the predictions will be. Also, watch out for large variances in periods. They will also impact predictions. If Azure AI does not find enough data, or the data varies a lot, the service will not make a prediction.  

## Design details

Subscriptions for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] come with access to several predictive web services in all regions where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available. Learn more at the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Licensing Guide. The guide is available for download on the [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central/overview/) website.

These web services are stateless, meaning they use data only to calculate predictions on demand. They don't store data.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can use your own predictive web service instead of ours. For more information, see [Create and use your own predictive web service for cash flow forecasts](#AnchorText).

### Data required for forecast

To make predictions about future revenue and expenses, web services require historical data from receivables, payables, and taxes.

#### Receivables

**Due Date**, **Amount (LCY)** fields of the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, where:

* The document type is *Invoice* or *Credit Memo*.
* The due date is between date that is calculated based on the values in the **Historical Periods** and **Period Type** fields on the **Cash Flow Setup** page and the work date.

Before it uses the predictive web-service, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compresses transactions by **Due Date** based on the value in the **Period Type** field on the **Cash Flow Setup** page.

#### Payables

**Due Date**, **Amount (LCY)** fields on the **Vendor Ledger Entries** page, where:

* The document type is *Invoice* or *Credit Memo*.
* The due date is between date that is calculated based on values in the **Historical Periods** and **Period Type** fields on the **Cash Flow Setup** page and the work date.

Before it uses the predictive web-service, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compresses transactions by **Due Date** based on the value in the **Period Type** field on the **Cash Flow Setup** page.

#### Tax

**Document Date**, **Amount** fields on the **VAT (Tax) Ledger Entries** page, where:

* The document type is *sales*.
* The document date is between the date that is calculated based on values in the **Historical Periods** and **Period Type** fields on the **Cash Flow Setup** page and the work date.

Before it uses the predictive web-service, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compresses transactions by **Document Date** based on value in the **Period Type** field in the **Cash Flow Setup** page.

## <a name="AnchorText"></a>Create and use your own predictive web service for cash flow forecasts

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the model is published by Microsoft and connected to the Microsoft subscription. For other deployment options, you have to create Machine Learning resources in your own Azure subscription. You can find sample steps in the [sample repo](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/MachineLearning). The purpose of this task is to get the API URI and API key.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Flow Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Expand the **Azure AI** FastTab, and then fill in the fields, including the API URL and API key provided from Azure Machine Learning studio. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. In the Accountant Role Center, choose the **Recalculate Forecast** action under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart.

# Map e-documents to purchase order lines with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

As procurement processes become more digital, the e-documents feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] plays a key role in automating how companies receive and process vendor invoices. Copilot can help by improving the mapping and matching of lines on vendor invoices to purchase orders. Copilot can reduce the time you spend on tasks that would normally require extensive search, lookup, and data entry. Another benefit is when vendor invoices don't relate exactly with purchase orders. Copilot can identify the corresponding purchase orders. Enhanced matching capabilities particularly benefit small and mid-sized organizations that need efficient document tracking for purchase order lines.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

The **E-Document** app supports scenarios for e-documents throughout the sales process. Copilot can also refine how you manage e-documents in the purchase process, particularly with respect to purchase orders. The app lets you specify the type of purchase document to create for each vendor when you receive e-invoices from them.

You can update existing purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the information from you received in the e-invoice.

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Prerequisites

- Your admin must activate the **E-Document Matching Assistance** capability. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).  

## Identify purchase orders

First, you can identify the purchase orders that you can automatically match. If your **Vendor** configured the **Receive E-Document To** field to work with **Purchase Orders**, when the electronic document is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (manually or from an external endpoint), [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does the following:

1. If the purchase order for this vendor exists and there's a purchase order number in the received e-document file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically links the e-document with the purchase order. The **Document Status** of this **E-Document** is **In Progress**, and the **E-Document Status** in the **Service Status** subpage is **Order linked**.  
The link shows in the **Document** field on the e-document. If you need to change the purchase order, you can use the **Update Purchase Order Link** action and then manually choose another purchase order for this vendor. You can only do so before you match the lines on the e-document and purchase order.  
2. If the purchase order for this vendor exists but there isn't a purchase order number in the received e-document file, if you manually upload the document you can choose an existing purchase order by opening the **Purchase Orders** list from the orders that you got from vendors that contain only e-document. If you don't select the correct purchase order, or if you received the e-document automatically from an external endpoint using the **Job Queue**, the new e-document isn't linked with a purchase document and the **Document Status** field shows **Error** and the **E-Document Status** in the **Service Status** subpage is **Imported document processing error**. To finish linking the purchase order, choose the **Update Purchase Order Link** action, and then choose a purchase order for the vendor.  

## Map lines

Copilot helps you automatically match e-invoice lines with purchase order lines, and offers extra matching intelligence to improve the matches.

After they're matched and mapped, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the matched purchase order with the relevant receipt information to ensure the correct quantities are received on the order lines.

You can match your received electronic documents with purchase order lines from two different places, from the **E-Documents** page or from the **Purchase Order** page. The easiest way to find purchase orders that are already linked is to use the **Linked Purchase Orders** tile on your Role Center. To find documents that aren't linked, use the **Waiting Purchase E-Invoices** tile to open a list of e-documents that are waiting for review.  

> [!NOTE]
> The **E-Document Activities** group with these two tiles is available in the following Role Centers:
>
> - Business Manager Evaluation
> - Business Manager
> - Accountant
> - Inventory Manager
> - Shipping and Receiving

When you want to run matching from a purchase order, select the **Map E-Document Lines with Copilot** action. The action is available on the **Purchase Orders** list page and the **Purchase Order** page. If you want to run matching from the **E-Documents** page, select the **Match Purchase Order with Copilot** action. To process with matching, follow these steps:

1. Select the **Map E-Document Lines with Copilot** or **Match Purchase Order with Copilot** action for documents that are already linked.  
1. The **E-Document Match Order Lines with Copilot** prompt displays and the **Purchase Order Matching** page in the background. Copilot is automatically creating the mapping for you.
1. After a few seconds, the **E-Document Match Order Lines with Copilot** page suggests lines for matching with a few details:

    1. The prompt header has the following information:

    |Field name |Description |
    |--------|-----------------|
    |Auto-matched | Specifies the number of matches proposed automatically. This number is based on a string comparison. If 80% or more of the descriptions overlap, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches them automatically without using Copilot capabilities. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also shows lines as auto-matched as item references exist with appropriate conditions. |
    |Copilot matched | Specifies the number of matches proposed by Copilot using both string and semantic comparison. |
    |E-Document No. | Specifies the linked e-document number. |
    |Invoice Total Amount Excl. VAT | Specifies the total invoice amount excluding VAT. |
    |Matched Total Amount Incl. VAT | Specifies the matched amount excluding VAT. |

    1. If all lines match, the following text displays in green font in the upper-right corner, **All lines (100%) are matched. Review match proposals**.  
    1. The **Matched proposal** lines contain the following information:  

       |Field name |Description |
       |--------|-----------------|
       |E-Document Line No. | Specifies the e-document line number from the original e-document file. |
       |E-Document Line Description | Specifies the e-document line description from the original e-document file. |
       |Matched Quantity | Specifies the quantity that is applied to the purchase order line. |
       |Proposal | Specifies the action that Copilot proposed for matching the purchase order lines. |
       |Learn Matching Rule | Specifies whether to create a matching rule for this proposal. If you select this checkbox, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates item references for items and text to account mappings for G/L accounts. |

    1. All fully suggested and matched lines are marked with green color. If there's an issue, for example, a different price but within the allowed price range, this line is marked with a yellow color. If there's any similarity between the description fields but the price difference is larger than allowed, this line is marked with a red color.
    1. If you aren't satisfied with some suggestions, you can delete them using the **Delete Line** action.  
    1. If you want to see proposal matchings, you can select the link in the **Proposal** column to open the **E-Document Match Details** page.
    1. On the **E-Document Match Details** page you can compare details from the **E-Documents** and **Purchase Order**, to be sure about the suggested matching before confirming it.
    1. After reviewing, close the page.

1. If you aren't satisfied with most of the suggestions, or if you don't want to use the **E-Document Match Order Lines with Copilot** feature, select **Discard it**. You can create the matches manually. To learn more, go to[manual matching](finance-how-use-edocuments-purchase.md).  
1. If you want to keep suggestions, select **Keep it**.
1. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] closes the Copilot prompt and lines on the **Purchase Order Matching** page are marked as green.  
1. You can continue to work as if you're doing a manual matching. For example, you can remove, create, or reset matches. If you don't want to change anything, just select the **Apply To Purchase Order** action and continue to work with the purchase order.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also select the **Match with Copilot** action from the **Purchase Order Matching** page again. If you do, you're asked whether you want to overwrite the existing matches.  

> [!NOTE]
> Price/Cost analysis and the check for available quantity are preprocessing activities.

# Setting up service management
Before you can start using Service Management features in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], there are a few things to set up. For example, you can establish coding for standard services, symptoms, and fault codes, and the service items and service item types based on your company’s customer service requirements.  

When you set up Service Management, you must decide what services to offer customers and the schedule for those services. A service is a type of work performed by one or more resources and provided to a customer. For example, a service could be a type of computer repair. A service item is the equipment or item needing servicing, for example, the computer needing repair, installed at a specific customer. You can set up services as part of a group of related repair or maintenance items.  
  
When you define a service, you can associate it with the skills required to perform the service. To help your service representatives be efficient, you can also set up real time troubleshooting guidelines and assign typical startup costs, such as travel costs or other fees.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Close open item ledger entries resulting from fixed application in the item journal

You can use the **Applies-from Entry** field on the **Item Journal** page to create a fixed application between an inbound transaction and the original outbound transaction. For example, to correct the outbound transaction or to process its return.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Fixed applications made in this manner only apply the cost, not the quantity. Accordingly, the posted positive item ledger entry will not close the applied outbound entry and will itself remain open. This also applies when you post a fixed application for a positive entry to a negative entry that has not been closed by a regular positive entry, then both the negative and the positive entries will remain open.  
>
> This also means that you cannot close an inventory period if such an entry exists.  

You can change and reapply application entries under certain conditions by using the **Application Worksheet** page.  

The following procedure shows how to close such entries by performing two corrective postings in the item journal.  

## To close open item ledger entries that result from a fixed application in the item journal  

1. Use the **Applies-from Entry** field to post a positive adjustment with the corresponding quantity. This closes the original negative entry with a fixed application.  

    The **Applies-from Entry** field specifies the number of the outbound item ledger entry whose cost is forwarded to the inbound item ledger entry when you post an inbound transaction of type **Positive Adjmt.** or **Purchase** with the item journal.  
2. Use the **Applies-to Entry** field to post a negative adjustment. This closes the original corrective positive entry with a fixed application.  

    The **Applies-to Entry** field specifies if the quantity in the item journal line should be applied to an already-posted document. If so, enter the entry number of the item ledger entry to which the item journal line should be applied.

# Entering Data

There are many general features that help you enter data easier, faster, and more precise. The basic principles and advanced features for entering data are described in this article.  

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

The examples in this article use the demonstration data.

## Work with editable fields

Fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] may contain different editable data, such as text or currency amounts. Editable fields typically display an input box where you can type or choose a value. Non-editable fields are typically displayed with a gray background.

Some editable fields provide a picker to help you specify a value.  

<!-- TODO: Add illustrations or images of each picker -->
|**Picker**        |**How it helps you specify a value**|
|------------------|------------------------------------|
|Date picker       |This picker displays a calendar that is based on your current regional settings. It helps you choose a single date.|
|Dropdown          |Dropdowns provide a choice of fixed values or reference records from another table|
|Switch or Checkbox|Some fields provide a simple choice of *Yes* or *No* values. The switch is used to specify this value, and is always displayed as a checkbox in lists|
|Assist edit       |Some fields provide custom pickers that are suited to looking up and choosing the best value for that field, such as popup window|

### Modifying a field value

To modify the value of a field, you must first set focus to that field. You set focus by doing the following actions:

- Use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key. The action selects the entire value.
- Left-click your mouse or similar input device. This action will only select the entire field value if the field is in a list.  

When you interact with fields in the user interface, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] typically favors selecting the entire field value to make it easier for you to replace that value.

When the entire field value is selected:

- Replace the value by just typing to specify a new value. If the field offers a picker, you can activate it using the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> keyboard shortcut.
- Use the <kbd>Delete</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key to clear the value.

select the <kbd>F2</kbd> key to toggle between selecting the entire field value or placing the cursor after the field's value. Placing the cursor at the end of the value makes it easier for you to append to the existing value.

When the cursor is shown at the end of the field value:
- Add to the value by just typing.
- Use the <kbd>Home</kbd>, <kbd>End</kbd>, <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>, and <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> keys to move the cursor within the value. If you're editing a field in a list, selecting the <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> key again when the cursor is at the beginning of the value will set focus to the previous field. Similarly, selecting the <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> key again when the cursor is at the end of the value will set focus to the next field.

> [!NOTE]
> After you specify a value, Business Central will only check that it's valid after you click outside the field or set focus to another element, such as the next field.  

[!INCLUDE [background_doc_journal_check](includes/background_doc_journal_check.md)]

## Use Copilot's autofill feature to assist in filling in fields (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner-section.md)]

When drafting a new record or editing an existing record, Copilot can suggest values for editable fields on the page. Learn more in [Autofill fields with Copilot (preview)](autofill-fields-with-copilot.md).

## Keyboard Shortcuts

There are several keyboard shortcuts that let you work "mouse-free" and speed up your data entry. These keyboard shortcuts are especially useful with large-scale entries and repetitive typing tasks.

For more information about shortcuts, see [Keyboard Shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md). A few of the keyboard shortcuts are discussed in this article.

## <a name="QuickEntry"></a>Accelerating Data Entry Using Quick Entry

Quick Entry is a feature designed for data entry when using the keyboard. Quick Entry works on fields (like on card pages) and in lists (rows and columns). It's beneficial when doing repetitive typing tasks that require creating multiple records in sequence. Examples include a batch of sales orders or registering new items.

You can use the Tab key to navigate from one field on a page to the next editable field. A disadvantage of using Tab is that it always goes sequentially to the next field. <!-- even if the field is non-editable or seldom filled it in.-->Quick Entry lets you change this path. With Quick Entry, you use the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to navigate through only those fields that you're interested in. Quick Entry skips non-editable fields and fields that you typically don't fill in. You might have already noticed this behavior on some pages. This behavior is because the fields to include when pressing Enter and which ones to skip have been predefined. You can customize Quick Entry by personalizing your workspace and optimizing how you enter data on each page.

### How Quick Entry Works

Every field can be marked as either *included in Quick Entry* or *excluded from Quick Entry*. Fields that are included in Quick Entry will be included in the path when you select <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Fields that are excluded from Quick Entry won't.

When you're finished entering data in a field, you simply select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to confirm the changes and go to the next field. If you want to reverse direction, and go the previous field, select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>. For more information about shortcuts, see [Quick Entry Shortcuts for Fields](keyboard-shortcuts.md#QuickEntry).

#### Tips and Tricks

The following list provides some useful information about using Quick Entry.

- It's available for any editable fields.
- It also works across columns and rows.
- It doesn't prevent accessing other elements of a page, such as actions. These elements are still accessible by using <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>.  
- It's not required that FastTabs are expanded for Quick Entry to work. If the next Quick Entry field is located in a collapsed FastTab, that FastTab will automatically expand and focus on the chosen field. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will remember that the FastTab should be expanded next time you visit the page.  
- Quick Entry works no matter whether fields are mandatory. So it's a good idea to ensure that mandatory fields are included in Quick Entry.
- By default, most fields are automatically included in Quick Entry. So initially your task will most likely be excluding fields from Quick Entry.

### To change Quick Entry fields

To set up Quick Entry on fields, you use personalization.

1. Start personalization by selecting the ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") icon, and then the **Personalize** action.
2. Select a field that you want change. In lists, select the corresponding column heading. Then, choose either **Include in Quick Entry** or **Exclude from Quick Entry**.

For more information about personalization, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Mandatory Fields

When you enter data on pages, certain fields are marked with a red asterisk. The red asterisk means that the field must be filled to complete a certain process. An example is when you post a transaction that uses the value in the field.  

Although a field is mandatory, you aren't forced to fill the field before you continue to other fields or close the page. The red asterisk only serves as a reminder that you'll be blocked from completing a certain process.  

## Finding Data As You Type

 When you start to type characters in a field, a drop-down list is displayed and shows possible field values. The list changes as you type more characters, and you can select the correct value when it's displayed.  

 Many fields have a down arrow button that you can choose. You choose the arrow to get a list of data that is available to enter in the field. The button has two functions depending on the type of field:  

- Lookup - Displays information from another table that you can enter in the field. You can select one piece of data at a time.  

- Drop-down - Displays the set of options that exist for the field. You can select only one of the options.  

## Copying and Pasting FAQ Fields and Lines

You can copy one or more rows from a list or a single field on a page. Then paste what you copied into the same page, another page, or an external document. You could, for example, paste to Microsoft Excel or Outlook email. In short, to copy, select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> (cmd+C in macOS) on your keyboard. To paste, select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> or <kbd>cmd+V</kbd> in macOS.

In a list, to copy the field in the same column of the row above, and paste it into the current row, just select <kbd>F8</kbd>.

For more information, see [Copying and Pasting FAQ](faq-copy-paste.yml).

## Filtering Line Items

To start filtering, select ![Filter pane icon](media/open-filter-pane-icon.png "Filter pane icon") at the top of the list or select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd> to open the filter pane. You work with the filter pane as you do on any other list. For more information, see [Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#filtering).

Filtering is especially helpful when viewing and analyzing longer documents. Imagine you open a posted sales invoice. Then, you filter the line items to display all line items that have an individual discount above 5%. Or, you filter to display only bike accessories with 'pro' in the name.

## <a name="Focus"></a>Focusing on Line Items

When working on documents that include a line items part, you can switch your view to focus only on the line items. Example documents are sales order or invoice page. The line items part expands so that it occupies almost the entire workspace. It hides other parts of the page except the actions area at the top. This layout gives you a better overview of the lines items, and provides more room to work on them.

You'll benefit particularly when you work with large line item lists and you want to enter data fast. This feature also provides advanced filtering capability. Like on other lists, browsing and searching through line items becomes even easier.

### Switching the Focus On and Off

To focus on lines items, select anywhere in the line item part, and then choose ![Focus Mode icon.](media/focus-mode.png "Focus mode icon") in the upper right corner, or select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd>.

To switch back to the normal view, choose ![Focus Mode icon.](media/focus-mode.png "Focus mode icon") or select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd> again.

## Multitasking Across Multiple Pages

You can open a card or document page in a new window. Opening a new window lets you:

- Work on multiple tasks at the same time
- Manage interruptions to the current task, such as taking an incoming call.
- Keep a window open for an ongoing task while you start or complete another task in windows.

To open the current card or document in a new window, choose ![Open New Window.](media/open-new-window-icon.png "Open new window icon") in the upper right corner, or select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd>.

<!--
When working on multiple tasks at a time or when managing interruptions to the current task, such as taking an incoming call, you can open a card or document page in a new window. This allows you to keep a window open for an ongoing task while you start or complete another task in one or more other windows.
-->

> [!NOTE]
> When you open other pages from a card or document that is opened in a new window, those pages will open in a new window even though you don't choose ![Open New Window.](media/open-new-window-icon.png "Open new window icon").

> [!NOTE]
> If you work in the Safari browser, a pop-up blocker may cause the new window to not open. If this is the case, specify the product URL as an allowed website. For information see, [Change preferences in Safari](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2102965).<br /><br />
> The same may happen in other browsers, such as Firefox. For more information, see [Pop-up blocker settings in Firefox](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2116400).  

Another way to multitask is to open [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on two or more browser tabs. When you do it this way, you should create a new tab and then copy/paste the URL of the original tab into the new tab. This way creates a new session.   

> [!NOTE]
> Don't use the **Duplicate** function of the browser to create the new tab as this may cause actions on one tab to block actions on other tabs because they are part of the same session.

## Entering Quantities by Calculation

When entering numbers into quantity fields, such as the **Quantity** field on an item journal line, you can enter the formula instead of the sum quantity.  

### Examples  

- If you enter 19+19, the field is calculated to 38.  

- If you enter 41-9, the field is calculated to 32.  

- If you enter 12*4, the field is calculated to 48.  

- If you enter 12/4, the field is calculated to 3.  

## Entering Negative Numbers

You can enter negative numbers in two ways. The number -20.5 can be entered as:  

- -20.5  

  or
- 20.5-  

In both cases, the amount will be recorded in as -20.5.  

If the last character of the expression is a **+** or a **-**, the entire expression will be recorded with that sign. An example, **10-20+** will result in 10 and not -10.  

## Entering Dates and Times

You can enter dates and times in all the fields that are assigned to dates (date fields). You can enter dates with or without separators.

> [!NOTE]  
> How you enter dates and times depends on your **Region** settings. For more information, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).  

### Entering Dates

You can either use the data picker to select a date from a calendar, or you can enter dates manually. This section provides a brief overview of how to enter dates. For more information, see [Work with Calendar Dates and Times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

For manually date entry, you can enter two, four, six, or eight digits:  

- Two digits are interpreted as the day. It will add the month and the year of the work date.  

- Four digits are interpreted as the day and the month. It will add the year of the work date.  

- If the date you want is in the range 01/01/1950 through 12/31/2049, enter the year with two digits. Otherwise, enter the year with four digits.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the two-digit year range may be different. Administrators can change the range by modifying the **CalendarTwoDigitYearMax** setting of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] server. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#General).

You can also enter a date as a weekday followed by a week number. Or, you can enter a year. For example, Mon25 or mon25 means Monday in week 25.  

Instead of entering a specific date, you can enter one of these codes.  

|Code|Result|  
|--------------|----------------|  
|t|Specifies today's date (the system date for the computer).|  
|p|Specifies an accounting period, where p means the first accounting period, p2 means the second accounting period, and so on. |
|w|Specifies the work date that is set up in the application. To change the work date, see [Changing Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md). You may want to use a work date if you have many transactions with a date other than today's date.|
|c|Specifies that the date after c is a closing date, for example C123101.|  

## Entering Times

When you enter times, you can insert any separator sign that you want between the units, but it isn't required. You don't have to write minutes, seconds, or AM/PM.  

The following table lists the various ways in which times can be entered and how they're interpreted.  

|Entry|Interpretation|  
|---------------|------------------------|  
|5|05:00:00|  
|5:30|05:30:00|  
|0530|05:30:00|  
|5:30:5|05:30:05|  
|053005|05:30:05|  
|5:30:5,50|05:30:05.5|  
|053005050|05:30:05.05|  

 You enter two digits for each unit of time if you don't enter a separator.  

## Entering Combined Datetimes

[!INCLUDE [datetimes](includes/datetimes.md)]

## Entering Duration

You enter a duration as a number followed by its unit of measure.  

Here are some examples.  

|Duration|Unit of measure**|  
|------------------|-------------------------|  
|2h|2 hrs|  
|6h 30 m|6 hrs 30 mins|  
|6.5h|6 hrs 30 mins|  
|90m|1 hr 30 mins|  
|2d 6h 30m|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins|  
|2d 6h 30m 56s 600ms|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins 56 secs 600 msecs|  

 You can also enter a number and it's automatically converted to a duration. The number you enter is converted according to the default unit of measure that has been specified for the duration field.  

 To see the unit of measure used in a duration field, enter a number and see which unit of measure it's converted to.  

 The number 5 is converted to 5 hrs, if the unit of measure is hours.  

## <a name="decimal"></a>Setting the decimal separator used by numeric keyboards

When using the <kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> key on a numeric keypad to enter data, the actual decimal separator that's entered in the field is determined by your region setting in Business Central. Most regions use the period (.) or comma (,) symbol as a separator for decimal values, as you would typically see in currency amounts. The decimal key on your keypad adapts to your region. It's often different to the period or comma keys on the rest of your keyboard. You set the region in Business Central on the **My Settings**  page.

For example, suppose you're using a numeric keyboard that uses a period (.) as the <kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> key. But you're entering data for a regional language that uses a comma (**,**) for the decimal separator, like French (France). So, you want decimals like "1.23" to be entered as "1,23". In this case, you can go to the **My Settings** page and set the **Region** to the target regional language to **French (France)**. For more information, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md#region).

> [!TIP]
> There may be occasions when you want to use the decimal separator to enter a period (.). For example, suppose you were entering a date range in a filter, like `01/01/2022..04/01/2022`, or anything that requires a period. To accommodate this case, select the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> keys on the numeric keyboard. This key combination switches the decimal separator between outputting a period and the decimal separator as determined by the **Region** setting.

# Control add-in resiliency in Business Central

From update 20.0 of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], control add-ins that perform slowly are automatically detected and a dialog similar to the following is displayed.

![Busy control add-in.](media/controladdin-resiliency.png "Busy control add-in.")

An unhealthy control add-in might affect your Business Central experience and cause the page you're working on to start slowly. It has no impact on data and your changes are always saved. If you see the warning as shown above, you can hide it, but it might come back and if the problem persists, you should contact your administrator.

# Setup Best Practices: Costing Method

The **Costing Method** on the item card defines item's cost flow is recorded and whether an actual or budgeted value is capitalized and used in the cost calculation.  

Setting the correct costing method according to item type and business environment is important to ensure economical inventories.  

The following table provides best practices on how to set up the **Costing Method** field. For more information, see [Design Details: Costing Methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).  

|Setup option|Best practice|Comment|  
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|  
|FIFO|Use where the product cost is stable.<br /><br /> Use for items with a limited shelf life, because the oldest goods need to be sold before they pass their sell-by date.|An item's unit cost is the actual value of any receipt of the item, selected by the FIFO rule.<br /><br /> In inventory valuation, it is assumed that the first items placed in inventory are sold first. **Note:**  When prices are rising, the balance sheet shows greater value. This means that tax liabilities increase, but credit scores and the ability to borrow cash improve.|  
|LIFO|Use where levels of inventories are consistently maintained or increased over time.|An item's unit cost is the actual value of any receipt of the item, selected by the LIFO rule.<br /><br /> In inventory valuation, it is assumed that the last items placed in inventory are sold first. **Note:**  When prices are rising, the value on the income statement decreases. This means that tax liabilities decrease, but the ability to borrow cash deteriorates. **Important:**  Disallowed in many countries/regions, as it can be used to depress profit.|  
|Average|Use where the product cost is unstable.<br /><br /> Use where inventories are piled or mixed together and cannot be differentiated, such as chemicals.|An item's unit cost is calculated as the average unit cost at each point in time after a purchase.<br /><br /> For inventory valuation, it is assumed that all inventories are sold simultaneously.|
|Specific|Use in production or trade of easily identifiable items with fairly high unit costs.<br /><br /> Use for items that are subject to regulation.<br /><br /> Use for items with serial numbers.|An item's unit cost is the exact cost at which the particular unit was received.|
|Standard|Use where cost control is critical.<br /><br /> Use in repetitive manufacturing, to value the costs of direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.<br /><br /> Use where there is discipline and staff to maintain standards.|An item's unit cost is preset based on estimated.<br /><br /> When the actual cost is realized later, the standard cost must be adjusted to the actual cost through variance values.|

# Change the Annual Amount on Service Contracts or Contract Quotes
You can change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote to correct the amount that will be invoiced annually.  

## To change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts** or **Service Contract Quotes**,and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the contract or contract quote.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the contract or contract quote for editing.  
4. Choose the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box if you want to change the annual amount and distribute the annual amount difference manually on the contract lines. Otherwise, clear the check box to automatically distribute the annual amount difference on the contract lines after you change the annual amount.  
5. Change the contents of the **Annual Amount** field. You cannot sign, that is, convert into a service contract if you are working on a contract quote, or lock a service contract that has a negative annual amount. If you set the annual amount to zero, the contents of the **Invoice Period** field must be **None** when either signing or locking the service contract.  
6. Depending on whether the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box is selected, run either the manual or automatic distribution of the annual amount difference. The contract lines will be updated so that the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field value is equal to the new annual amount.  

## Distributing Differences Between New and Calculated Annual Amounts
If you change the annual amount of a service contract or contract quote, you may want to distribute the difference between its new and calculated annual amounts on the contract lines. There are three ways to distribute amounts:

* Even distribution  
* Distribution based on line amounts  
* Distribution based on Profit

### Even Distribution
If you change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote, you may want to distribute the difference between its new and calculated annual amounts on the contract lines. Even distribution is one of the automatic distribution methods that can help you spread equally the new and calculated annual amounts difference between line amounts on the contract lines. The following list of distribution procedure steps describe the main idea of this method:  

1. The difference between the new **Annual Amount** and **Calcd. Annual Amount** field values is divided by the number of the contract lines in the service contract or contract quote.  
2. The **Line Amount** field value is updated by adding the result of the previous operation.  
3. The contents in the **Line Discount Amount**, **Line Discount %**, and **Profit** fields are updated with regard to the new value in the **Line Amount** field in the following way:   
    * Line Discount Amount = Line Value - Line Amount.  
    * Line Discount % = Line Discount Amount / Line Value * 100.  
    * Profit = Line Amount - Line Cost.  

 The steps are repeated for each contract line.  

#### Example  
The **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box is not selected in the service contract that contains three contract lines with such information.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|30.00|40.00|0.00|0.00|40.00|10.00|  
|Item 2|40.00|50.00|10.00|5.00|45.00|5.00|  
|Item 3|50.00|70.00|10.00|7.00|63.00|13.00|  

The **Annual Amount** field value is equal to the contents of the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field, which is always set to the sum of the line amounts. In this case, it is equal to the following:  40 + 45 + 63 = 148.  

If you change the **Annual Amount** to 139, the amount is calculated that should be added to each **Line Amount** field value. This amount is calculated by subtracting the **Calcd. Annual Amount** from the new **Annual Amount** field value and dividing the result by the number of the contract lines in the service contract. In this case, it will be equal to the following: (139 - 148) / 3 = -3. Then, the last calculated figure is added to each **Line Amount** field value and the **Line Discount %**, **Line Discount Amount**, and **Profit** field values are updated using the formulas in the procedure described above.  

Finally, the contract lines will contain this data.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|30.00|40.00|7.50|3.00|37.00|7.00|  
|Item 2|40.00|50.00|16.00|8.00|42.00|2.00|  
|Item 3|50.00|70.00|14.29|10.00|60.00|10.00|  

### Distribution Based on Line Amount
If you change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote, you may want to distribute the difference between its new and calculated annual amounts on the contract lines. Distribution Based on Line Amount is an automatic method that can help you spread the new and calculated annual amounts difference between the line amounts on the contract lines. This distribution will be performed proportionally to their line amount shares in the calculated annual amount. The following list of distribution procedure steps for each contract line describe the main idea of this method:  

1. The line amount percentage contribution is calculated as follows: the contents of the **Line Amount** field is divided by the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field values on all contract lines.  
2. The **Line Amount** field value is updated by adding to it the difference between the new and calculated annual amounts, which is multiplied by the line amount percentage contribution.  
3. The contents in the **Line Discount Amount**, **Line Discount %**, and **Profit** fields are updated with regard to the new value in the **Line Discount Amount** field in the following way:  

    * Line Discount Amount = Line Value - Line Amount  
    * Line Discount % = Line Discount Amount / Line Value * 100  
    * Profit = Line Amount - Line Cost  

The steps are repeated for each contract line.  

#### Example  
The **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box is not selected in the service contract that contains three contract lines with such information.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|15.00|17.00|3.00|0.51|25.00|1.49|  
|Item 2|20.00|23.00|None|0.00|55.10|3.00|  
|Item 3|24.00|27.00|3.00|0.81|112.70|2.19|  

The **Annual Amount** field value is equal to the contents of the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field which is always set to the sum of the line amounts. In this case, it is equal to the following: 16.49 + 23.00 + 26.19 = 65.68.  

If you change the **Annual Amount** to 60, the profit percentage contributions for each contract line is calculated:  

* Item 1 – 5 / (5 + 5.1 +12.7) = 0.2193 %  
* Item 2 – 5.1 / (5 + 5.1 + 12.7) = 0.2237  
* Item 3 – 12.7 / (5 + 5.1 + 12.7) = 0.557  

The **Line Amount** field value is updated on each contract line using the following formula: Line Amount = Line Amount + difference between the new and calculated annual amounts * Percentage Contribution. After that, the **Line Discount Amount**, **Line Discount %**, and **Profit** field values are updated using the formulas described in the procedure above.  

Finally, the contract lines will contain this data.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|15.00|17.00|11.41|1.94|15.06|0.06|  
|Item 2|20.00|23.00|8.65|1.99|21.01|1.01|  
|Item 3|24.00|27.00|11.37|3.07|23.93|-0.07|  

### Distribution Based on Profit
If you change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote, you may want to distribute the difference between its new and calculated annual amounts on the contract lines. Distribution Based on Profit is one of the automatic methods that can help you spread the new and calculated annual amounts difference between the line amounts on the contract lines. This distribution will be performed proportionally to their profit shares in the total contract or contract quote profit. The following list of distribution procedure steps for each contract line describe the main idea of this method:  

1. The profit percentage contribution is calculated as follows: the contents of the **Profit** field is divided by the sum of **Profit** field values on all contract lines.  
2. The **Line Amount** field value is updated by adding to it the difference between the new and calculated annual amounts, which is multiplied by the profit percentage contribution.  
3. The contents in the Line Discount Amount, Line Discount %, and Profit fields are updated with regard to the new value in the **Line Amount** field in the following way:  

    * Line Discount Amount = Line Value - Line Amount  
    * Line Discount % = Line Discount Amount / Line Value * 100  
    * Profit = Line Amount - Line Cost  

#### Example  
The **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box is not selected in the service contract that contains three contract lines with such information.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|20.00|25.00|0.00|0.00|25.00|5.00|  
|Item 2|50.00|58.00|5.00|2.90|55.10|5.10|  
|Item 3|100.00|115.00|2.00|2.30|112.70|12.70|  

The **Annual Amount** field value is equal to the contents of the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field, which is always set to the sum of the line amounts. In this case, it is equal to the following:  25.00 + 55.10 + 112.70 = 192.80.  

 If you change the **Annual Amount** to 180, the profit percentage contributions for each contract line are calculated:  

* Item 1 – 5 / (5 + 5.1 +1 2.7) = 0.2193 %  
* Item 2 – 5.1 / (5 + 5.1 + 12.7) = 0.2237  
* Item 3 – 12.7 / (5 + 5.1 + 12.7) = 0.557  

The **Line Amount** field value is updated on each contract line using the following formula: Line Amount = Line Amount + difference between the new and calculated annual amounts * Percentage Contribution. After that, the **Line Discount Amount**, **Line Discount %**, and **Profit** field values are updated using the formulas in the step 3 of the procedure described above.  

Finally, the contract lines will contain this data.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|20.00|25.00|11.24|2.81|22.19|2.19|  
|Item 2|50.00|58.00|9.93|5.76|52.24|2.24|  
|Item 3|100.00|115.00|8.20|9.43|105.57|5.57|

# Invoice sales

You can usually create either a sales order or sales invoice to record your agreement with a customer to sell certain products on certain delivery and payment terms.  

However, you must use a sales order instead of a sales invoice if you:  

* Need to ship only part of an order quantity, for example, because the full quantity isn't on hand.  
* Ship products after you post the corresponding sales invoices.
* Sell items your vendor delivers directly to your customer, known as drop shipment. Learn more at [Make Drop Shipments](sales-how-drop-shipment.md).  

In all other situations, sales orders and sales invoices work in the same way. Learn more about how to use sales orders at [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

You can negotiate with the customer by first creating a sales quote, which you can convert to a sales invoice when you agree on the sale. Learn more at [Make Sales Quotes](sales-how-make-offers.md).

## Create sales invoices

If the customer decides to buy, you post the sales invoice to create the related quantity and value entries. When you post the sales invoice, you can also email it as a PDF attachment. You can prefill the email body with a summary of the invoice and payment information, such as providing a link to PayPal. Learn more at [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md#to-send-documents-by-email). When the customer pays the invoice, you can register that payment in different ways, depending on the size and preferred workflows of your organization. Learn more at [Registering Payments](#register-payments) section.  

Item cards can be of the **Inventory**, **Service**, or **Non-Inventory** type to specify if the item is a physical inventory unit, a labor time unit, or a physical unit not kept on inventory, respectively. Learn more at [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md). The sales invoice process is the same for all three item types.

You can fill customer fields on the sales invoice in one of two ways, depending on whether the customer is already registered. See step 2 in the following procedure.

### To create a sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Customer Name** field, enter the name of an existing customer. If, however, the customer is new and therefore not registered, follow these steps to populate standard customer information on the **Sales Invoice** page:

    1. In the **Customer Name** field, enter the name of the new customer.
    2. In the dialog box about registering the new customer, choose **OK**.
    3. On the **Select a template for a new customer** page, choose a template to base the new customer card on, then choose **OK**.
    4. A new customer card displays the information on the selected customer template. Fill in the remaining fields. Learn more at [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).  
    5. When you complete the customer card, choose **Close** to return to the **Sales Invoice** page.

   Several fields on the sales invoice are now filled with information that you specified on the new customer card.  
3. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Invoice** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you allow the customer to pay immediately, for example, by cash or PayPal, then fill in the **Payment Method Code** field. The payment is then recorded as soon as you post the sales invoice. If you select *Cash*, then the payment is recorded in a specified balancing account.

    You're now ready to fill in the **Lines** FastTab with products you're selling to the customer or for any transaction with the customer you want to record in a general ledger (G/L) account.

4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select the type of product, charge, or transaction you post for the customer on the sales line.
   > [!TIP]
   > If you've set up recurring sales lines for the customer, such as a monthly replenishment order, you can reflect that in the order by choosing the **Get Recurring Sales Lines** action.
5. In the **No.** field, select a record to post according to the value in the **Type** field.

    You leave the **No.** field blank in the following cases:

    * If the line is for a comment. Write the comment in the **Description** field.
    * If the line is for a catalog item. Choose the **Select Catalog Items** action. Learn more at [Work With Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).

6. In the **Quantity** field, enter how many units of the product, charge, or transaction the line should record for the customer.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the item is of the **Service** type, or the **Type** field contains **Resource**, then the quantity is a time unit, such as hours, as indicated in the **Unit of Measure Code** field on the line. Learn more at [Set Up Item Units of Measure](inventory-how-setup-units-of-measure.md)

    The value in the **Line Amount** field is calculated as *Unit Price* × *Quantity*.  

    The price and line amounts are with or without sales tax, depending on what you selected in the **Prices Including Tax** field on the customer card.  
7. If you want to give a discount, enter a percentage in the **Line Discount %** field. The value in the **Line Amount** field updates accordingly.  

    If special item prices are set up on the **Sales Prices and Sales Line Discounts** FastTab on the customer or item card, and upon meeting the price criteria, the price and amount on the sales line is automatically updated. Learn more at [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).  
8. Repeat steps 4 through 7 for every product or charge that you want to invoice the customer for.

    The totals fields under the lines are automatically updated, as you create or modify lines, to display the amounts posted to the ledgers.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In very rare cases, the posted amounts may deviate from what is displayed in the totals fields. This is typically due to rounding calculations in relation to VAT or sales tax.<br /><br />To verify the amounts you’ll post, use the **Customer Statistics** FactBox. Also, when you choose the **Release** action, the values in the totals fields will update to include rounding calculations.

9. In the **Inv. Discount Amount Excl. Tax** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field.

    If you set up invoice discounts for the customer, then the specified percentage value is automatically inserted in the **Invoice Discount %** field if the discount criteria are met, and the related amount is inserted in the **Inv. Discount Amount Excl. Tax** field. Learn more at [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

10. When the sales invoice lines are completed, choose the **Post and Send** action.  

The **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box displays the customer's preferred method of receiving documents. You can change the sending method by choosing the lookup button for the **Send Document to** field. Learn more at [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).

The related item and customer ledger entries are now created in your system, and the sales invoice is output as a PDF document. The sales invoice is removed from the list of sales invoices and replaced with a new document in the list of posted sales invoices.  

### Calculate invoice discounts on sales

[!INCLUDE [sales-invoice-discounts](includes/sales-invoice-discounts.md)]

## Posted invoices

[!INCLUDE [posted-invoices](includes/posted-invoices.md)]

You can easily correct or cancel a posted sales invoice before the final payment. This is useful if you want to correct a typing mistake or if the customer requests a change early in the order process. Learn more at [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Sales Invoices](sales-how-correct-cancel-sales-invoice.md). If the posted sales invoice is paid, then you must create a sales credit memo to reverse the sale. Learn more at [Process Sales Returns or Cancellations](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md).  

[Open the **Posted Sales Invoices** list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=143) in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Register payments

Depending on your business needs, you can get paid and register a payment in different ways: manually, automatically, and through payment services.  

You can process the payments straight from the customer card. Use the **Register Customer Payments** action to get an overview of unpaid invoices for that customer. Then, mark the invoice as paid partially or in full. This payment reconciliation processes your customer payments by matching amounts received in your bank account with the related unpaid sales invoices, and then posts the payments. Learn more in the [To reconcile payments individually](receivables-how-reconcile-customer-payments-list-unpaid-sales-documents.md#to-register-customer-payments-individually) section.  

In business environments where the customer pays some time after delivery. According to the payment terms, a posted sales invoice remains open (unpaid) until the Accounts Receivable department verifies the payment, and applies it to the posted sales invoice. This can be done manually or automatically. Learn more at [Reconcile Customer Payments with the Cash Receipt Journal or from Customer Ledger Entries](receivables-how-apply-sales-transactions-manually.md) and [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).  

In business environments where the customer pays immediately, such as via PayPal or cash, payment is recorded immediately when you post the sales invoice, which means the posted sales invoice is closed as fully applied. You select the relevant method in the **Payment Method Code** field on the sales order. For electronic payments, such as PayPal, you must also fill in the **Payment Service** field. Learn more at [Enable Customer Payments Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

You can even create directly paid invoices for unregistered customers by setting up a "cash customer" card for them, which you point to on the sales invoice. Learn more at [Set Up Cash Customers](finance-how-to-set-up-cash-customers.md).  

> [!TIP]
> If you want to send your customers reminders of overdue payments, you need to first set up reminder levels and terms. Learn more at [Set Up Reminder Terms and Levels](finance-setup-reminders.md).

# Production Scrap (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Production Scrap** report shows the quantity of capacity scrap each month, with a breakdown by code, location, and item category. This information helps uncover where waste is happening so you can take steps to reduce it.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/production-scrap.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Production Scrap Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/production-scrap.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for business leaders and manufacturing managers.

COOs use the report to measure the effectiveness of manufacturing processes and resources. By analyzing the capacity scrap quantity, you can identify areas that need improvement and optimize resource use. For example, a high scrap rate at a particular location might indicate a problem with the machinery or materials it uses. By addressing these issues, you can reduce waste and improve efficiency, leading to cost savings.

For manufacturing managers, this report reveals important measures about capacity scrap quantity. By analyzing the scrap rate, you can identify areas that need improvement, such as processes or materials. For example, a high scrap rate for a particular item category might indicate a problem with the materials it uses. By addressing these issues, you can optimize resource use to reduce waste and save costs.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Production Scrap* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [Capacity Scrap Quantity](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#capacity-scrap-qty)

# Review and apply payments manually after automatic application
For each journal line representing a payment on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, you can open the **Payment Application** page to see all candidate open entries for the payment and view detailed information for each entry about the data matching that a payment application is based on. Here, you can manually apply payments or reapply payments that were applied automatically to a wrong entry. For more information about automatic application, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   When the bank account that you are reconciling payments for is set up for the local currency, then the **Payment Application** page will show all open entries in the local currency, including open entries for documents that were originally invoiced in foreign currencies. Payments applied to entries with converted currencies may therefore be posted with different amounts than on the original document because of the potentially different exchange rates used by the bank and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] respectively.

Therefore, we recommend that you look for foreign currency codes in the **Currency Code** field on the **Payment Application** page to check if applications are based on converted currencies. To review the original document amount in the foreign currency and to see the exchange rate used, choose the **Applies-to Entry No.** field, and then, on the shortcut menu, choose the drilldown button to open the **Customer Ledger Entries** or **Vendor Ledger Entries** page.

Any gains-and-loss adjustment required due to currency conversions isn't handled automatically by [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]  
>   You cannot apply entries with a different sign than the sign on the payment. For example, to close both a negative-sign credit memo and its related positive-sign invoice, you must first apply the credit memo to the invoice, and then apply the payment to the invoice with the reduced remaining amount.

> [!WARNING]  
>   If you use payment discounts, and if the payment date is before the payment due date, then the **Remaining Amt. Incl. Discount** field on the **Payment Application** page will be used for matching. Otherwise, the value in the **Remaining Amount** field will be used. If the payment was made with a discounted amount after the payment due date, or the full amount was paid but a discount was granted, then the amount will not be matched.

> [!NOTE]  
>   You can only apply a payment to one account. If you want to split the application on multiple open entries, for example to apply a lump-sum payment, then the open entries must be for the same account. For more information, see steps 7 and 8 in the procedure in this topic.

## To review or apply payments after automatic application
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Reconciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the payment reconciliation journal for a bank account that you want to reconcile payments for. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).
3. On the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, select a payment that you want to review or manually apply to one or more open entries, and then choose the **Apply Manually** action.
4. Select the **Applied** check box on the line for the open entry that you want to apply the payment to.
5. The payment amount, which is also shown in the **Transaction Amount** field on the **Payment Application** page, is inserted in the **Applied Amount** field, but you can modify the field, for example if you want to apply the amount to several open entries.
6. To apply a part of the paid amount to another open entry for the account, for example to apply a lump-sum payment, select the **Applied** check box for the line. The applied amount is automatically deducted from the transactions amount to reflect the distribution on the two open entries.
7. To apply a part of a payment to one or more open entries that doesn't exist in the database, create a new line under the line for the same account. In the **Applied Amount** field, enter the amount to apply on the new line, and then adjust the **Applied Amount** field on the existing line.
8. Repeat steps 5, 6, or 7 for other open entries that you want to apply a full or partial payment amount to.
9. When you have reviewed a payment application or manually applied to one or more open entries, choose the **Accept Application** action.

The **Payment Application** page  closes, and on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, the value in the **Match Confidence** field is changed to **Accepted** to indicate to you that you have reviewed or manually applied the payment.

# Manage Employee Absence
To manage an employee's absence, you must record the absence on the **Absence Registration** page. It can then be viewed in different ways for analysis and reporting needs.

You can view employee absence in two different pages:

* The **Absence Registration** page, where you register all employee absences with a line for each absence.
* The **Employee Absences** page, where the absences for one employee only is shown. This is the information that you entered on the **Absence Registration** page, filtered by the particular employee.

To obtain meaningful statistics, you should always use the same unit of measure (hour or day) when registering employee absences.

## To register employee absence
You can register employee absences on a daily basis or at some other interval that meets your organizational needs.

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Absence Registration**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in a line for each employee absence you want to register.
4. Close the page.

    > [!Tip]
    > To obtain meaningful statistics, always use the same unit of measure, hour or day, when registering employee absences.

## To view an individual employee's absence
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant employee, and then choose the **Absences** action.

    The **Employee Absences** page opens showing all the absences and the date on which they started and ended.

## To view an employee's absence by categories
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant employee, and then choose the **Absences by Categories** action.
3. On the **Empl. Absences by categories** page, fill in the filter fields as necessary, and then choose the **Show Matrix** action.

    The **Empl. Absences by Cat. Matrix** page opens showing all absences, broken down by causes of absence.

## To view all employee absences by category
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Absence Registration**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Absence Registration** page, choose the **Overview by Categories** action.

# Request quotes

A purchase quote can be used as a preliminary draft for a purchase order, which can then be converted to a purchase invoice.

## Create a purchase quote

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Quotes**, then choose the related link.
2. Create a new document, in the same way as you make a purchase order. Learn more at [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

## Convert a purchase quote to a purchase order

When you have accepted the vendor's quote, you can convert it to a purchase order to process the purchase.

1. Open the purchase quote you want to convert, then choose the **Make Order** action.

The purchase quote is removed from the database. A purchase order is created based on the information in the purchase quote, which you can use to process the purchase, and then post a purchase invoice. In the **Quote No.** field on both the purchase order and purchase invoice you can see the number of the purchase quote they were made from.

> [!NOTE]
> It is not possible to convert a purchase quote to a purchase invoice directly, like it is possible with sales quotes. For details on how to create a purchase invoice, read [Record Purchases with Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

# Undo Assembly Posting

Undo the posting of an assembly order to correct a mistake or remove an unwanted posting.

When you undo a posted assembly order, corrective item ledger entries are created to reverse the original entries. Each positive output entry for the assembly item is reversed by a negative output entry. Each negative consumption entry for an assembly component is reversed by a positive consumption entry. Fixed cost application is automatically created between the corrective and original entries to ensure exact cost reversal.  

When you undo a fully posted assembly order, you can recreate the original order. For example, to make corrections before you post it again.  

When you undo a partially posted assembly order, all affected quantity fields, such as the **Assembled Quantity**, **Consumed Quantity**, and **Remaining Quantity** fields, are restored to the values they had before the posting.  

To recreate or restore assembly orders, the item in the original posting must meet the following conditions:  

* It's still in inventory. That is, it hasn't been sold or otherwise consumed by outbound transactions.  
* It isn't reserved.  
* It's in the bin that it was output to.  

Assembly orders can only be restored if the number and sequence of lines on the original assembly order aren't changed.  

> [!TIP]  
> To resolve conflicts caused by changes in the lines, manually revert the changes on the lines in question before undoing the posted assembly order. You can post the assembly order and then recreate it when you undo the posting.  

The following procedure describes how to undo posted assembly orders that contain items that were assembled-to-stock. To undo posted assembly orders with items that were assembled-to-order, use the **Undo Shipment** action on the related posted shipment. To learn more about undoing shipments, go to [Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments](finance-how-reverse-journal-posting.md). Undoing the posted assembly order happens in the same way as described in that article.  

## To undo posting of an assembly order

You can undo fully or partially posted assembly orders.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Assembly Orders**, and choose the related link.  

   Each partial posting creates a separate posted assembly order.  
2. Open the posted assembly order that you want to undo, and then choose the **Undo Assembly** action.  

    If the posted assembly order is related to a fully posted assembly order that's been deleted, you can recreate then deleted order. For example, you might recreate the order because you want to reprocess it.  
3. To recreate the assembly order, choose **Yes**. To undo the posting without recreating the assembly order, choose **No**.  

The **Reversed** field on the assembly order changes to **Yes**. The assembly order posting is now reversed. You can process the entire assembly order if you chose to recreate it, or the open assembly order that you have restored to its original state.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To restore quantities from multiple partial postings in an assembly order, you must undo all the posted assembly orders by following steps 1 through 3.

# The Microsoft Pay extension

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Effective February 8 2020, changes in the Microsoft Pay service will affect the Microsoft Pay extension in Microsoft [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)]. Due to the changes, after February 8, the **Pay now** payment links that the Microsoft Pay extension generates for invoices in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will not open Microsoft Pay. Customers who are using the extension should change their Payment Services setup to start using the PayPal extension instead.<br /></br>
>
> From January 8, we will display a notification in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The notification will contain a link to the settings that you need to change and to more information. After February 8, the Microsoft Pay extension will no longer be available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].<br /></br>
>
> The changes impact the following versions of Business Central:
> - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central October 2018
> - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central April 2019
> - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central 2019 Release Wave 2

Customers continuously require higher customer service, both in terms of the quality of product but also in terms of delivery and payment services. The Microsoft Pay service helps you increase your customer service.

The Microsoft Pay extension adds a Microsoft Pay link to your sales documents so customers can easily pay using Microsoft Pay. Then you can send the documents by email to provide higher customer service and shorten the time it takes for customers' payments to arrive on your bank account.

The Microsoft Pay extension provides the following benefits:
- Customer payments appear faster on your bank account.
- Customers have more ways to pay invoices.
- Microsoft Pay offers a trustworthy payment service, which customers prefer to entering credit card information on unknown web sites.
- Microsoft Pay offers multiple ways of handling payments, including credit card processing, such as PayPal and Stripe.
- The Microsoft Pay link can be embedded automatically on every invoice document or by the user.
- Because this functionality is built as an extension, it gives you full control to enable it when and if your business processes require it.

Enabling payment service extensions is free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], however, you'll need to contact the payment service to get an account. For more information, see [Enable Customer Payment Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

# Work with bills of material

You use bills of materials (BOMs) to structure parent items that must be assembled from other items or produced by resources or machine centers from components.

## Assembly BOMs or production BOMs

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports two different types of BOMs:

| BOM type | General category | Example |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| [Assembly BOMs](assembly-how-work-assembly-boms.md) | Warehouse / assembly | Items that consist of other items, assembled with basic or no resources. |
| [Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md) | Manufacturing / production | Items that consist of different components and subassemblies, produced at a work or machine center. |

You use assembly orders for making end items from components in a simple process that can be performed by one or more basic resources, which aren't machine or work centers, or without any resources. For example, an assembly process could be to pick two wine bottles and one coffee sack and then pack them as a gift item.  

An assembly BOM is the master data that defines which component items go into an assembled end item and which resources are used to assemble the assembly item. When you enter an assembly item and a quantity in the header of a new assembly order, the assembly order lines automatically fil in according to the assembly BOM with one assembly order line per component or resource. Learn more at [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md).

You use production orders for making end items from components in a complex process that requires a production routing and work or machine centers, which represent production capacities. For example, a production process could be to cut steel plates in one operation, weld them in the next operation, and paint the end item in the last operation. Learn more at [Manufacturing](production-manage-manufacturing.md).

A production BOM is the master data that defines a production item and the components that go into it. For assembly items, the production BOM must be certified and assigned to the production item before it can be used in a production order. When you enter the production item on a production order line, either manually or by refreshing the order, then the production BOM content becomes the production order components. Learn more at [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).

The concept of resources in production is much more advanced than in assembly management. Work centers and machine centers act as resources. The operations assigned to resources in production routings represent production steps. Learn more at the [Create Routings](production-how-to-create-routings.md) article.

Both assembly orders and production orders might be linked directly to sales orders. However, you can only use assembly orders to customize the end item directly for a customer request with the sales order.

# Inventory Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Power BI Inventory app is designed to pull data directly from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to give leadership, managers, and warehouse staff key information about inventory. This app has various reports that offer insights into business operations. Use the information from these reports to make informed decisions that ensure you meet demand, keep costs low, and don't delay production.

## Inventory analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Operations Officer
- Chief Finance Officer

### Example scenario: maintaining stock turnover

COOs want to ensure that stock moves so you don't have aging stock on hand. The [Inventory by Lot](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-lot.md) report shows how much stock is in each lot and where stock is expired. You can also compare this report with the information on the [Purchase and Sales Quantity](inventory-powerbi-purchase-and-sales-qty.md) report to ensure you aren't over-purchasing and increasing storage costs.

## Inventory analytics for the management team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Warehouse Manager
- Procurement Manager
- Supply Chain Manager
- Production Manager

### Example scenario: maintaining stock on hand

Warehouse managers want to ensure that each location has adequate stock levels. The [Inventory by Location](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-location.md) report helps you ensure adequate stock levels at each location. It also indicates where to move stock around to supply locations.

Production or procurement managers can use the [Gross Requirement](inventory-powerbi-gross-requirement.md) to ensure that production planning is supplied by stock.

## Inventory analytics for the warehouse team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Order picker
- Order shipping

### Example scenario: tracking stock

Order pickers in a warehouse want to ensure that each bin contains enough stock to meet orders. Use the [Bin Contents](inventory-powerbi-bin-contents.md) report to be sure that bins contain the right amount of stock. To see tracking information, use the [Bin Contents by Item Tracking](inventory-powerbi-bin-contents-by-item-tracking.md) report.

To see lot and serial information on an item by item basis, other staff in the warehouse can use either the [Inventory by Lot](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-lot.md) or [Inventory by Serial](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-serial-no.md) reports.

## Use the reports

The following table provides descriptions on how you can use each report in the Power BI Inventory app.

# Ship items with a warehouse shipment

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you pick and ship items using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Outbound Process|Require Pick|Require Shipment|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------|----------------|-----|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post the pick and shipment from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post the pick and shipment from an inventory pick document|Turned on||Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post the pick and shipment from a warehouse shipment document||Turned on|Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post the pick from a warehouse pick document, and post the shipment from a warehouse shipment document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

To learn more about shipping items, go to [Outbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md).

This article refers to methods C and D in the table. In both methods, you start by creating a shipment document from a business source document. Then you pick the specified items for the shipment.

When a location requires warehouse shipments, you can ship items based on source documents that were released to the warehouse. Releasing source documents makes the items on them ready to be handled in the warehouse. The following are examples of source documents:

* Sales orders
* Purchase return orders
* Transfer orders
* Service orders

You can create a warehouse shipment in one of two ways:

* In a push fashion, when work is done on an order-by-order basis. Choose the **Create Warehouse Shipment** action in the source document to create a warehouse shipment for the document.
* In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action in the source document to release it to the warehouse. A warehouse employee creates a **Warehouse Shipment** for one or many released source documents. The following procedure describes how to create warehouse shipment in a pull fashion.

## To ship items using a warehouse shipment document

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Shipments**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose **New**.  
3. In the **No.** field, choose the number series to use to create an ID for the shipment.  
4. In the **Location Code** field, choose the location you're shipping from. 

    When you retrieve source document lines, some of the information from the location is copied to each line.  
5. If the location requires bins, fill in the **Bin Code** field. Depending on your setup, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]] can add the bin code for you. Learn more at [Zone and bin codes](warehouse-how-ship-items.md#zone-and-bin-codes).  
6. You can get the source document in two ways:

    * Choose the **Get Source Documents** action. The **Source Documents - Outbound** page opens. Here you can select one or more source documents released to warehouse that requires shipment.
    * Choose the **Use Filters to Get Src. Docs.** action. The **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page opens. You can select the source document filter and apply it. All released source document lines that fulfill the filter criteria are added on the **Warehouse Shipment** page. Learn more at [How to Use Filters to Get Source Documents](warehouse-how-ship-items.md#how-to-use-filters-to-get-source-documents).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your location uses cross-docking and bins for each line, you can review the quantity of items placed in the cross-dock bins. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the quantities whenever the fields on the shipment are updated. If they're the items on the shipment you're preparing, you can create a pick for all the items and then complete the shipment. Learn more at [Cross-Dock Items](warehouse-how-to-cross-dock-items.md).

7. Create a warehouse pick. If the location requires picking, you can create pick activities for warehouse shipments in one of two ways:

    * In a push fashion, where you use the **Create Pick** action. Select the lines to pick and specify information about the picks. For example, which bins to take from and place in, and how many units to handle. The bins can be predefined for the warehouse location or resource.
    * In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action. On the **Pick Worksheet** page, use the **Get Warehouse Documents** action to get your assigned picks. When the warehouse picks are fully registered, the lines in the **Pick Worksheet** are deleted. Learn more at [Pick Items for Warehouse Shipment](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-for-warehouse-shipment.md).

    > [!TIP]
    > For a location that doesn't require picking, you can print warehouse shipment and use it as a picking list.

8. Specify the quantity to ship.  

    For a location that requires picking, the **Qty. to Ship** field is updated automatically when the pick is registered. Otherwise, the **Qty. to Ship** field is filled with the quantity outstanding for each line when warehouse shipment line is created.

    You can change the quantity, but you can't ship more items than the number in the **Qty. Outstanding** field on the source document line or the **Qty. Picked** field if picking is required.

    To set the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field on all lines to zero, choose the **Delete Qty. to Ship** action. For example, setting the quantities to zero is useful if you're using a barcode scanner to update the shipping quantities. To add the quantity available for shipping, choose the **Autofill Qty. to Ship** action.

9. Post the shipment.

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-shipment](includes/preview-posting-shipment.md)]

## How to use filters to get source documents

From a warehouse shipment, you can use the **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page to retrieve the released source document lines that define which items to ship.

1. In the warehouse shipment, choose the **Use Filters to Get Src. Docs.** action. 
2. To set up a new filter, enter a descriptive code in the **Code** field, then choose the **Modify** action.

    The **Source Document Filter Card - Outbound** page opens.

3. Use the filters to define the type of source document lines to retrieve. For example you can select types of source documents, such as sales or transfer orders.
4. Choose **Run**.  

All released source document lines that meet the filter criteria are added on the **Warehouse Shipment** page on which you set the filters.

You can make an unlimited number of filter combinations. Filters are saved on the **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page and are available the next time you need them. You can change the criteria at any time by choosing the **Modify** action.

## Zone and bin codes

If bins are mandatory at the location, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests a zone and bin code on the warehouse shipment document.

* For advanced configurations in which a location uses directed put-away and pick, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the bin specified in the **Shipment Bin Code** field on the **Location Card**. If a **Shipment Bin Code** isn't specified, the field is blank. If the item and shipment bin don't match, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] leaves the shipment bin blank.
* In other cases, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always uses the bin specified in the **Shipment Bin Code** field on the **Location Card** first. If a shipment bin code isn't specified, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the bin code from the source document.

## Handling Assemble-to-Order Items in Warehouse Shipments

In assemble-to-order scenarios, use the **Qty. to Ship** field on warehouse shipment lines to record how many units are assembled. The quantity is posted as assembly output when you post the warehouse shipment. For other warehouse shipment lines, the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field is zero.

When workers finish assembling some or all of the assemble-to-order quantity, record the quantity on the **Qty. to Ship** field on the warehouse shipment line. Then choose the **Post Shipment** action. The assembly output is posted, including the component consumption. A sales shipment for the quantity is posted for the sales order.

From the assembly order, you can choose **Asm.-to-Order Whse. Shpt. Line** to access the warehouse shipment line.

After you post the warehouse shipment, various fields on the sales order line are updated to show progress in the warehouse. The following fields are also updated to show how many assemble-to-order quantities remain to be assembled and shipped:

* **ATO Whse. Outstanding Qty.**
* **ATO Whse. Outstd. Qty. (Base)**

> [!NOTE]
> In combination scenarios where a part of the quantity must be assembled and another must be shipped from inventory, two warehouse shipment lines are created. One is for the assemble-to-order quantity, and one is for the inventory quantity.
>
> The assemble-to-order quantity is handled as described in this article. The inventory quantity is handled as a regular warehouse shipment line. To learn more about combination scenarios, go to [Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md).

# Monitor project progress and performance

The work in process (WIP) feature lets you estimate the financial value of ongoing projects in the general ledger.

As a project progresses, materials and resources are consumed and expenses incurred that you must post to the project. In many cases, you might post expenses for a project before invoicing. But if you only post expenses, your financial statement is inaccurate. To track the actual value of the project, calculate WIP and post it to the general ledger. The following are the standard WIP methods:

* Cost value
* Sales value
* Recognizable cost
* Percentage of completion
* Completed contract

You can also create a WIP method that meets the needs of your organization and set it as the default. Learn more at [Understanding WIP Methods](projects-understanding-wip.md).

If you want to view the result using a different method, change the method and recalculate WIP. You can recalculate WIP as often as you like. The value isn't automatically posted to the general ledger. After you calculate WIP using the method you prefer, you can post to the general ledger.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project WIP Methods**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Close the page.
4. To make this new method the default, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects Setup**, then choose the related link.  
5. In the **Default WIP Method** field, choose the method from the list.

## Define a WIP method for a project

When you create a new project, you must specify which project WIP method applies. In some cases, the project WIP method you use is already set as the default.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action. Learn more at [Create Projects](projects-how-create-jobs.md).  
3. On the **Project Card** page, in the **WIP Method** field from the **Posting** FastTab, select a WIP method from the list. If a default method is defined, you can select another option if needed.  

### Define a WIP method for a project task

You can define a WIP method for a project task, exclude project tasks from WIP calculation, or group tasks to be calculated together.

If you want to calculate WIP for each project task individually, WIP posting provides defined dimensions for the specific tasks.

The **WIP-Total** specifies project tasks you want to group together when calculating WIP and recognition. In any group of tasks, there needs to be one task that satisfies two conditions:
<!--But doesn't the parenthetical below contradict this -* if there is no total, the application sets the total for you, meaning the condition does not HAVE to be satisfied, right? Or am I missing something?-->

* **WIP-Total** is set to **Total**. If there are no project tasks with **WIP-Total** set to Total, Total is set automatically on the last project task line when WIP is calculated for the first time.
* The number in the **Project Task No.** field is the final one in the group or range of project tasks.

The following table describes the options:

| Field | Description |
|--|--|
| **\<blank\>** | Leave blank if the project task is part of a group of tasks. |
| **Total** | Defines the range or group of tasks included in the WIP and recognition calculation. Within the group, any project task with **Project Task Type** set to **Posting** is included in the WIP total, unless the task's **WIP-Total** field is set to **Excluded**. |
| **Excluded** | Applies only to a task with **Project Task Type** of **Posting**, in which case the task isn't included when WIP and recognition are calculated. |

In the following example, project tasks are divided into two WIP total groupings, demonstrating how the **WIP-Total** field works:

|Project task no.|Description|Project task type|**WIP-Total** field|  
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|  
|1000|Preparation|Begin-Total|\<blank\>|
|1010|.    Cleaning|Posting|**Excluded**|
|1099|Total preparation|End-Total|\<blank\>|
|1100|Carpeting|Begin-Total|\<blank\>|
|1110|.    Gluing floor|Posting|**Excluded**|
|1120|.    Laying out carpet|Posting|\<blank\>|
|1199|Total carpeting|End-Total|\<blank\>|
|1200|Finish|Begin-Total|\<blank\>|
|1210|.    Vacuum cleaning carpet|Posting|\<blank\>|
|1299|Total finish|End-Total|**Total**|
|1300|Error correction|Begin-Total|\<blank\>|
|1310|.    Error correction|Posting|\<blank\>|
|1399|Total error correction|End-Total|**Total**|

You notice:

* For *1000* through *1299*, WIP is calculated separately for this group of project tasks. Note, however, that two of the tasks, 1010 and 1110, are excluded from the WIP calculation because their project task type is **Posting**.
* For *1300* through *1399*, WIP is calculated separately for this group of project tasks.

## Calculate WIP

You can determine the WIP amount to post to balance sheet accounts for the period end reporting by using the **Project Calculate WIP** batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Calculate WIP**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Calculate WIP** action.
3. On the **Project Calculate WIP** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The batch job only calculates the WIP, it doesn't post it to the general ledger. To post WIP, run the **Post WIP to G/L** batch job after you've calculated the WIP. Learn more in the following procedure.

### Review warnings

If your WIP calculation results in a *WIP was calculated with warnings* message, you might want to review the warnings.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project WIP Cockpit**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the project for which you want to review warnings. The **WIP Warnings** toggle is enabled for projects that have WIP warnings.
3. Choose the **Show Warning** action.

### Delete WIP entries

If you want to try different WIP methods, you might get a *The Project Task cannot be modified because the project has associated project WIP entries* error. To be able to check WIP method, delete existing WIP entries.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project WIP Cockpit**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the project for which you want to delete WIP entries.
3. Choose the **Delete WIP Entries** action.

## Post WIP

When you calculate WIP, you can post it to balance sheet accounts for the period end reporting. Use the **Project Post WIP to G/L** batch job.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Post WIP to G/L**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Project Post WIP to G/L** page, fill in the fields as necessary.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.

## Calculate and post project completion entries

After you complete all activities for a project, including posting usage and invoicing, you must update the project's status to **Completed**. Then, you must reverse any WIP that was posted to the general ledger.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select an open project, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **Posting** FastTab, in the **Status** field, select **Completed**.
4. Follow the assistance steps to calculate and post the WIP, or follow steps 5 and 6 to do so manually.  
5. Choose the **Calculate WIP** action.
6. On the **Project Calculate WIP** page, fill in the fields as necessary.  

     The project WIP entries created by running the batch job have the **Project Complete** checkbox selected to show that they're completion entries.  
7. Choose the **Post WIP to G/L** action.
8. On the **Project Post WIP to G/L** page, fill in the fields as necessary.  

     The project WIP general ledger entries created by running the batch project have the **Project Complete** checkbox selected to show that they're completion entries.

## View project ledger entries

All project-related entries are recorded in project registers and sequentially numbered, starting with 1. From the project register, you can get an overview of all project ledger entries.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Registers**, and choose the related link.
2. Select a relevant register, and then choose **Project Ledger** action.

On the **Project Ledger Entries** page, you can review the entries that are associated with any project.

# Handle vendor payment disputes

You can mark a vendor ledger entry as **On hold** if there's a dispute about a supplier document. The on hold status helps you maintain transparency and efficiency while you manage and resolve the issue.

## To set a vendor ledger entry on hold

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendor ledger entries**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the entry that you want to mark.
3. Choose **Edit List**. You can now enter up to 3 characters (likely your initials) in the **On Hold** field to indicate the document is on hold. 

## On hold entries, and the Suggest Vendor Payments batch job

The **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job excludes vendor ledger entries that are **On Hold**. To learn more, go to [Suggest vendor payments](payables-how-suggest-vendor-payments.md).


## Analyzing On hold vendor ledger entries 

There are multiple other options for analyzing entries on hold. 

For instance, on the **Vendor ledger entries** page you can set a filter on the **On Hold** field to this value
``` Filter
<>''
```


You can also take the vendor ledger entries list page into analysis mode and define an analysis tab. To learn more, go to
[Using data analysis to show vendor ledger entries on hold](ad-hoc-analysis-purchasing.md#example-finance-accounts-payable---vendor-ledger-entries-on-hold)


Or you can run the [Payments on Hold](reports/report-319.md) report.

## Block vendors

You can also block a vendor, for example because of insolvency, so that people can't select the vendor for purchase documents, or so that they can't post payments to the vendor.

To learn more, go to [Block vendors](payables-how-block-vendors.md).

If you use Power BI on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data, it's easy to track KPIs or metrics that are important to you.

With metrics in Power BI, you can curate your own metrics and track them against key business objectives, in a single pane. This feature enhances data culture by promoting accountability, alignment, and visibility for teams and initiatives within organizations.

Follow this four-step process to set up Power BI metrics:

1. Create a scorecard in Power BI. Learn more at [Create scorecards in Power BI](/power-bi/create-reports/service-goals-create).  
2. Add the metrics you want to track by connecting to your Power BI report on telemetry. Learn more at [Create connected metrics](/power-bi/create-reports/service-goals-create-connected).  
3. Add alerting, if needed, to define status rules for your metrics. Learn more at [Create automated status rules for metrics](/power-bi/create-reports/service-metrics-status-rules).  

    This step automates status updates based on rules that govern the metric. Rules trigger changes based on value, percentage of target met, date conditions, or a combination of the three, making the rules versatile. For connected metrics, these status rules refresh every time the data in your scorecard refreshes.
4. Follow metrics to get alerts in Teams or by email. Learn more at [Follow your metrics](/power-bi/create-reports/service-metrics-follow).  

Learn more about Power BI metrics at [Get started with metrics in Power BI](/power-bi/create-reports/service-goals-introduction).

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with Business Central 2023 release wave 2, it's possible to embed scorecards from Power BI metrics in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# Sharing Business Central records and page links in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a couple ways to share data from Business Central directly in a Microsoft Teams conversation:

- With the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app installed in Teams, you can include an interactive card of any Business Central record in a Teams conversation.

- With or without the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app installed, you can share a link from pages in Business Central to a Teams conversation.

The following sections describe the different ways in detail.

## Include and view a Business Central card in a Teams conversation

With the Business Central app for Teams, you can copy a link from any Business Central record, like a customer or sales order, and paste the link into a Teams conversation. The app connects Microsoft Teams to your business data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]\. It then expands the link into a compact, interactive card that displays information about the record. Once in the conversation, you and coworkers can view more details about the record, edit data, and take action&mdash;without leaving Teams.

[![Teams integration with Business Central.](media/teams-intro-vBC24.png)](media/teams-intro-vBC24.png#lightbox)

### Prerequisites

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams. Learn more in [Install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] App for Microsoft Teams](across-install-app-for-teams.md)

> [!NOTE]
> All participants in a Teams conversation will be able to view cards for Business Central records that you submit to the conversation. But to view more details about records, by using the **Details** or **Pop out** buttons on a card, they'll need access to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in [Managing Microsoft Teams Integration](admin-teams-integration.md#minimum-requirements-1).

### Include a Business Central card in a Teams conversation

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using your browser.
2. Open the record that you want to share.

    The app is designed to display a card for almost any type of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] page. But it provides the best experience when used for pages that display a single record, such as an item, customer, or sales order.
3. Copy the link to the page.

    There are two ways to copy the link. The easiest and preferred way is to select **Share** ![Share icon in Business Central](media/share-icon.png) > **Copy Link**. Alternatively, copy the entire URL from the browser's address bar.

    [![Copy Business Central URL from browser.](media/teams-copy-link.png)](media/teams-copy-link.png#lightbox)
4. Go to Teams and start a conversation, which can be chat with a person, group of persons, or a team channel.
5. Paste the link (URL) in the message box where you compose a message. You might need to add a space or press <kbd>Enter</kbd> for the URL to be recognized.

    ![Paste Business Central URL in Teams.](media/teams-paste-url-v3.png)

    > [!TIP]
    > If you get a message like: *Business Central wants to show a preview of this link.*, it means that you don't have the Business Central app for Teams installed. To install the app, select **Show Preview** and follow the instructions.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Depending on your Business Central version, the first time you paste a link into a conversation, you might be asked to sign in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and give consent for the app to connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Follow the on-screen instructions. You'll only have to do this step once.

6. Wait a moment while a card is generated in the message box.
7. When the card appears, review the contents of the card carefully for any sensitive information before sending the message. This step is important because once you send the message, everyone in the conversation can see the card.
8. If the card looks good, select **Send** to submit it to the conversation.
9. To view more details or make changes to the record shown in the card, select **Details**. Learn more in the next section.

### View card details

Once a card's been sent to a conversation, all participants with the [proper permissions](admin-teams-integration.md#permissions) can select **Details** to open a window that displays more information about the record&mdash;and possibly make changes to the record. It doesn't matter if you're the one sending the card or the one receiving the card. The **Details** feature is especially useful to recipients because it quickly provides concise, targeted information about the record.

The details window is similar to what you'd see in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], but it's focused on the page or record that the card is about. When you're finished viewing and making changes, close the window to return to the Teams conversation.

Here are a couple things to keep in mind when working with the card details:

- To open the card details, users must have permission on the page and its data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]\.
- Cards in Teams chats aren't automatically updated to changes. Any changes you save to a record in the details window are saved in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]\. But the card in Teams won't show the changes in the conversion, until you paste the link again.

Learn more about working with cards and card details in [Teams FAQ](teams-faq.md).

## <a name="share-link"></a>Share a link to page from Business Central to Teams

Directly from most collection pages, like the **Items** page, and details pages, like the **Items** card, you can send a link to the page to specific recipients in a Teams conversation. For example, you can share a link to a filtered view of your records. Recipients can then select the link to open the page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]\.

[![!The Share menu displayed on a card.](media/teams-share-link-v2.png "The Share menu displayed on a card.")](media/teams-share-link-v2.png#lightbox)

### Prerequisites

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- (Optional) You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams. 

  With the app installed, messages you send with the link will also include a compact card for the page. For more information about how to install the app, see [Install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] App for Microsoft Teams](across-install-app-for-teams.md).

### Share a link

1. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]\, open the page that you want to share.
2. At the top of the page, select the ![!Share to other apps action on pages.](media/share-icon.png) icon, then **Share to Teams**.
3. If you're asked, sign in to Teams with your user name and password.
4. In the **Share to Teams** page, type a name of a person, group, or channel that you want send the message to.
5. The message box includes a link to the page. If the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams is installed, a card for the linked record or page will also appear in the message box.

   Add more information if you like, then select **Share**.
6. The link is now shared. To view the conversation, select **Go to Teams**.

# Responding to requests about users' personal data

Data subjects can request several types of actions regarding their personal data. For example, under some privacy laws and regulations, they have the right to request the export, deletion, and modification of their personal data. These requests are called *Data Subject Requests*. If you have classified the sensitivity of your data, and are sure they are correct, an administrator can respond to requests by using the options in the **Data Privacy** tab in the **Administration of users, security groups and permissions** Role Center.

## Types of requests

The following table provides examples of the types of requests administrators can respond to.

> [!Note]
> While we provide capabilities for responding to these types of request, and thereby accessing, personal data, it's your responsibility to ensure that personal and sensitive data are located and classified appropriately.

|Request Type|Description and Suggested Response|
|-----|-----|
|Portability requests|A data subject can make a data portability request. You must export the data subject's personal data from your systems and provide it in a structured, commonly used format. To respond to these requests, you can use the **Data Privacy Utility** to export personal data to an Excel file or a RapidStart configuration package. Using Excel, you can edit the personal data and save it in a commonly used, machine-readable format, such as .csv or .xml. For RapidStart configuration packages, you can configure master data tables and their related tables that contain personal data. <br><br> **Note:** When you export data, you specify a minimum sensitivity level. The export includes the minimum and all sensitivity levels above it. For example, if you export data that is classified as Personal, the export also includes data classified as Sensitive. <br><br>When exporting data related to a data subject, the **Data Privacy Utility** looks for direct relationships between the data subject and data related to the data subject. Indirect relationships between data related to the data subject and other data are not exported automatically by the **Data Privacy Utility**. For example, the Contact table has directly related Contact Profile Answers data, and the Contact Profile Answers table is further related to Profile Questions data. If you want to export Profile Questions as well, you must add this table manually as a row with the appropriate filters in the configuration package that the **Data Privacy Utility** creates.<br><br>The **Data Privacy Utility** only considers tables of the type **Normal**. Data in other types of tables, such as CDS, CRM, ExternalSQL, and others resides in external systems, and portability requests should be handled in those systems.|
|Requests for deletion|A data subject can request that you delete their personal data. There are several ways to delete personal data using the customization capabilities, but the decision and implementation is your responsibility. In some cases, you might choose to directly edit your data. For example, delete a contact and then run the Delete Canceled Interaction batch job to delete interactions for the contact. <br><br> **Note:** If you've specified a date in the **Allow Document Deletion Before** field on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** or **Purchases & Payables Setup** pages, you might need to change the date so that you can delete posted sales and purchase documents that have posting dates on or before that date.|
|Requests for correction|A data subject can request that you correct inaccurate personal data. There are several ways to do so. In some cases, you can export lists to Excel to quickly bulk-edit multiple records, and then import the updated data. For more information, see [Exporting your Business Data to Excel](about-export-data.md). You can also manually edit fields that contain personal data, such as editing information about a customer in the Customer card. However, records such as general, customer, and tax ledger entries are important. If you store personal data in business transaction records, consider using the customization capabilities to modify such personal data.|

## Restrict data processing for a data subject

A data subject can request that you temporarily stop processing their personal data. To honor such requests, you can mark their record as blocked due to privacy to stop processing their data. When a record is marked as blocked, you cannot create new transactions that use that record. For example, you cannot create a new invoice for a customer when either the customer or the salesperson is blocked. To mark a data subject as blocked, open the card for the data subject, for example the Customer, Vendor, or Contact cards, and choose the **Privacy Blocked** check box. You may need to choose **Show More** to display the field.  

## Handling data subject requests when using a trial version

Certain types of personal data are part of a Microsoft 365 account, and only administrators can export the data. The process for handling data subject requests is different depending on the type of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant.

If you have a paid subscription for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], users must contact their organization's tenant administrator to make a data subject request. Administrators have the administrative rights and tools to fulfill data subject requests.

If you signed up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from the [Trials](https://trials.dynamics.com/) page, and you're still using the trial version, users can download and export their own data in the [Work and School Privacy page in the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/GDPRViralBlade).

On the Work and School Privacy page, you can also close your account. However, we recommend that you export and delete all data first. Deleting your account means that you lose access to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can still mark people as blocked due to privacy and export, edit, or delete transactions as explained elsewhere in this article.  

## Exporting data from tables not classified by data subject

If you must export data that isn't classified in a way so that it's automatically exported, such as data from the Profile Answers table, you must take the following actions:

* Consider whether you really must export supplemental data that isn't directly related to the contact.
* Add the table and relationship manually to the Rapid Start package and export it directly from the Rapid Start package. We generate a Rapid Start package for you, so that you can tweak it in such situations.

## Handling data about minors

If a contact person's age is below the age of legal consent according to the laws in your region, you can indicate that by choosing the **Minor** check box on the **Contact** card. When you do, the **Privacy Blocked** check box is automatically selected. When you receive consent from the minor's parent or legal guardian, you can choose the **Parental Consent Received** check box to unblock the contact. Though you can process personal data for minors, you cannot use the profiling functionality in Dynamics 365 Sales.

> [!Note]
> The Change Log can record details such as when, and by whom, the **Parental Consent Received** check box was chosen. An administrator can set that up by using the **Change Log Setup** guide, and also choosing the **Log Modification for Parental Consent Received** check box on the **Contact** card. For more information, see [Logging Changes](across-log-changes.md).

# Setup Best Practices: Supply Planning
Supply planning is a critical business area. When set up and used correctly, supply planning helps a company avoid stock out and reduce both ordering costs and inventory costs.  

 It is not possible to prescribe one optimal setup of all planning fields as this varies from company to company because of business variables, such as market situation and business strategy. However, there are best practices for selecting options in items cards and global setup fields to help get the company started with timely and cost-effective inventory flows.  

 The following topics provide best-practice information about how to set up selected planning fields that are key to inventory and supply planning.

# Post Capacities

In the capacity journal, you post consumed capacities that are not assigned to the production order. For example, maintenance work must be assigned to capacity, but not to a production order.  

## To post capacities  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Capacity Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the **Posting Date** and **Document No.** fields.  
3. In the **Type** field, enter the type of the capacity, either **Machine Center** or **Work Center**, that you are posting.  
4. In the **No.** field, enter the number of the machine center or work center.  
5. Enter the relevant data in the other fields, such as **Starting Time**, **Ending Time**, **Quantity**, and **Scrap**.  
6. Choose the **Post** action to post the capacities.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

## To view work center ledger entries  

In the **Work Center Card** and **Machine Center Card** pages, you can view the posted capacities as a result of finished production orders.    
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant **Work Center** card from the list, and then choose the **Capacity Ledger Entries** action.

# Revalue Fixed Assets

Revaluation of fixed assets can consist of appreciations, write-downs, or general value adjustments.

When the value of a fixed asset increases, you post a journal line with appreciation to the depreciation book. The new amount is recorded as appreciation according to the fixed asset posting setup.

When the value of a fixed asset decreases, you post a journal line with a lower amount, a write-down, to the depreciation book. The new amount is recorded as a write-down according to the fixed asset posting setup.

Indexation is used to adjust multiple fixed asset values, for example per general price changes. The **Index Fixed Assets** batch job can be used to change various amounts, such as write-down and appreciation amounts.

## To post appreciation from the fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create an initial journal line and fill in the fields as necessary.
3. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Revaluation**.
4. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for appreciation posting.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   Step 4 only works if you have set up the following: On the **FA Posting Group Card** page for the posting group of the fixed asset, the **Appreciation Account** field contains the general ledger debit account and the **Appreciation Bal. Account** field contains the general ledger account to which you want to post balancing entries for appreciation. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).  
5. Choose the **Post** action.

## To post a write-down from the fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create an initial journal line, and fill in the fields as necessary.
3. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Write-Down**.
4. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for write-down posting.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   Step 4 only works if you have set up the following: On the **FA Posting Group Card** page for the posting group of the fixed asset, the **Write-Down Account** field contains the general ledger credit account and the **Write-Down Expense Account** field contains the general ledger debit account to which you want to post balancing entries for write-downs. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).
5. Choose the **Post** action.

## To perform general revaluation of fixed assets

Indexation is used to adjust multiple fixed asset values, for example per general price changes. The **Index Fixed Assets** batch job can be used to change various amounts, such as write-down and appreciation amounts. The **Allow Indexation** checkbox on the **Depreciation Book** page must be selected.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Index Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

    Revaluation lines are created per your settings in step 2. The lines are created in either the fixed asset journal or the fixed asset G/L journal, depending on your template and batch setup on the **FA Journal Setup** page. For more information, see [Set Up General Fixed Asset Information](fa-how-setup-general.md).
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Select the journal with the fixed assets that you want to revalue, and then choose the **Ledger Entries** action.  
6. Check the created entries, and then choose the **Post** action to post the journal.

    > [!TIP]  
    >   If the index figures are for simulation purposes only, you can create a special depreciation book to store them in. Then these entries will not affect any of the other depreciation books.

## To post other acquisition costs

You post other acquisition cost for a fixed asset from a purchase invoice or from a fixed asset journal in the same way as you post the original acquisition cost. For more information, see [Acquire Fixed Assets](fa-how-acquire.md).  

If depreciation is already calculated for the fixed asset, select the **Depr. Acquisition Cost** checkbox to have the other acquisition cost less the salvage value depreciated in proportion to the amount by which the previously acquired fixed asset is depreciated. This method ensures that the depreciation period isn't changed.  

The depreciation percentage is calculated as:  

*P = (total depreciation x 100) / depreciable basis*

*Depreciation amount = (P/100) x (extra acquisition cost - salvage value)*  

Remember to select the **Depr. until FA Posting Date** checkbox on the invoice, the fixed asset G/L journal, or the fixed asset journal lines to ensure that depreciation is calculated from the last fixed asset posting date to the posting date of the other acquisition cost.

### Example - Posting Other Acquisition Costs

A machine is purchased on August 1, 2000. The acquisition cost is 4,800. The depreciation method is straight-line over four years.

On August 31, 2000, the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run. Depreciation is calculated as:

*book value x number of depreciation days / total number of depreciation days = 4800 x 30 / 1440 = 100*  

On September 15, 2000, an invoice is posted for painting the machine. The invoice amount is 480.

If you selected the **Depr. until FA Posting Date** checkbox on the invoice before posting, the following calculation is made:  

15 days of depreciation (from 09/01/00 to 09/15/00) is calculated as:

*book value x number of depreciation days / remaining number of depreciation days = (4800 - 100) x 15 / 1410 = 50*

If you selected the **Depr. Acquisition Cost** checkbox on the invoice before posting, the following calculation is made:  

*The other acquisition cost is depreciated as ((150 x 100) / 4800) / 100 x 480 = 15*

The depreciable basis is now *5280 = (4800 + 480)*, and the accumulated depreciation is *165 = (100 + 50 + 15)*, corresponding to 45 days of depreciation of the total acquisition cost. This calculation means that the asset is totally depreciated within the estimated lifetime of four years.  

When the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run on 09/30/00, the following calculation is made:  

*Remaining depreciable life is 3 years, 10 months, and 15 days = 1395 days*  

*Book value is (5280 - 165) = 5115*  

*Depreciation amount for September 2000: 5115 x 15 / 1395 = 55.00*  

*Total of depreciation = 165 + 55 = 220*  

If you didn't select the **Depr. until FA Posting Date** checkbox, the asset would lose 15 days of depreciation because the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job run on 09/30/00 would calculate depreciation from 09/15/00 to 09/30/00. This means that when the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run on 09/30/00, the calculation is as follows:  

*Remaining life time is 3 years, 10 months, and 15 days = 1395 days*  

*Book value is (4800 + 480 - 100 - 15) = 5165*

*Depreciation amount for September 2000: 5165 x 15 / 1395 = 55.54*  

*Total of depreciation = 100 + 15 + 55.54 = 170.54*

# Split Warehouse Activity Lines

In warehouse put-aways, movements, or picks, and in inventory put-aways and inventory picks, bins are suggested for picking or putting away items. The quantity that's actually in the suggested bin may not be sufficient, or there isn't enough room in the bin to put away the required quantity. In these cases, you can split the line so that the items for one line are either taken from or placed in more than one bin.  

The following procedure applies to the following warehouse documents:

* Warehouse put-aways
* Warehouse movements
* Warehouse picks
* Inventory put-aways
* Inventory movements
* Inventory picks  

## To split warehouse activity lines  

1. Open a warehouse activity line where you are trying to handle an insufficient quantity.  
2. In the **Qty. to Handle** field, enter the reduced quantity that you're able to handle.  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Actions** action, choose the **Functions** action, and then choose the **Split Line** action. A new line appears. The line is a copy of the original line except that the **Qty. to Handle** field contains the quantity that you removed from the original line.  
4. Assign a bin and, if you're using directed put-away and pick, a zone, or continue splitting the line as necessary until you find appropriate bins for all of the quantity.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the location uses directed put-away and pick and you split the lines, you must be familiar with the warehouse and be able to choose a bin that matches the storage requirements of the item and that fulfills the general requirements of the warehouse document. For example, you would not split a line on a pick document and place some items in bulk storage.

# Sales analytics

Businesses capture lots of data during daily activities that supports business intelligence (BI) for sales managers:

- Opportunities
- Sales quotes
- Sales orders
- Sales invoices

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's sales data:

- Power BI reports for sales
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using Open in Excel)
- Built-in sales analytics tools
- Built-in sales reports

Each of these features has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data analysis and the role of the user. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to gain sales insights.

## Analytics needs in sales

When you think about the analytics needs in sales management, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes different analytics needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use the data in different ways. For example, people in asset management and finance interact with data differently than people in sales.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role              | Data aggregation  | Typical ways to consume data                          | 
|-------------------|-------------------| ----------------------------------------------------- |
|CCO / CFO / CEO    | Performance data  | KPIs <br> Dashboards <br> Financial reports           |
|Sales Manager      | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports <br> Ad-hoc analysis      | 
|Account Manager / Sales Person | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports <br> On-screen task data |

<!-- 
## Sales KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In sales management, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their organization's sales performance:

- TODO  
-->

## Using Power BI to monitor sales KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In sales, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their sales organization's performance:

- Gross Profit
- Gross Profit Margin
- Sales by period
- Sales vs. budget
- Number of new customers
- Period-over-Period Sales Amount Growth
- Sales by item/customer/location/sales person

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales Overview Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-overview.png":::

These sales KPIs, and more, are available in the Power BI Sales app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Power BI sales app](sales-powerbi-app.md).

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-sales-app](includes/power-bi-sales-app.md)]

## Use financial reporting to produce financial statements and KPIs related to sales

The **Financial Reporting** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. Specifically for sales management, you can set up financial reports on the general ledger (G/L) accounts that you use to track sales postings.

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence. A dimension is data that you add to an entry as a parameter. Dimensions let you group entries that have similar characteristics, such as customers, regions, products, and salesperson. Among other purposes, use dimensions when you define analysis views and create financial reports. To learn more, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

To learn more about financial reports, go to [Prepare Financial Reports with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md).

## Finance reporting across business units or legal entities related to sales

Some organizations use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in multiple business units or legal entities. Others use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in subsidiaries that report to parent organizations. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives accountants tools that help them transfer general ledger entries from two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company. Specifically for sales management, you might want to consolidate general ledger entries for your sales accounts to be able to track sales KPIs across business units or legal entities.

To learn more, go to [Company consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of sales data

Sometimes, you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data Analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **General Ledger Entries**, **Customer Ledger Entries**, **Item Ledger Entries**, or **Posted Invoices**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-customer-ledger-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Customer Ledger Entries page." lightbox="media/data-analysis-customer-ledger-entries.png":::

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

:::image type="content" source="media/open-in-excel-customer-ledger-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Customer Ledger Entries data using Excel." lightbox="media/open-in-excel-customer-ledger-entries.png":::

> [!TIP]
> If you configure OneDrive for system features, the Excel workbook opens in your browser.

To learn more about how to do ad-hoc analysis on sales data, go to [Ad hoc analysis of sales data](ad-hoc-analysis-sales.md).

## Built-in reports for sales

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports, tracing functions, and tools to help sales organizations report on their data.

[!INCLUDE [sales_reports_report_explorer](includes/sales-reports-report-explorer-include.md)]

## On-screen sales analytics

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you sales overviews and tasks to do. Here are some examples to get you started:

- [Open the Sales Quotes list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9300)
- [Open the Sales Orders list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9305)
- [Open the Posted Sales Invoices list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=143)
- [Open the Sales Return Orders list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9304)
- [Calculate order promising dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md)
- [Calculate delivery dates for sales orders](sales-date-calculation-for-sales.md)
- [Track packages](sales-how-track-packages.md)
- [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md)
- [Blanket sales order status](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md#to-view-the-status-of-a-blanket-sales-order)
- [View unposted and posted blanket sales order lines](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md#to-view-unposted-and-posted-blanket-sales-order-lines)

### Show sales-related general ledger entries and balances from the Chart of Accounts page

The **Chart of Accounts** page shows all general ledger accounts with aggregated numbers posted to the general ledger. From this page, you can do things like:  

- View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.  
- Review a list of posting groups for that account.
- View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

Specifically for sales, you can create a view that only shows the accounts you use for posting sales entries.

:::image type="content" source="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png" alt-text="Example of how the Chart of Accounts page shows finance insights" lightbox="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png":::

To learn more, go to [Understand the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md#the-chart-of-accounts).

### Analyze data by dimensions (related to sales)

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from.  

So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department or location, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts structure.

To learn more, go to [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

# Work Center Load (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Work Center Load** report measures the load and the allocated capacity of each work center. Use this report to ensure that work centers aren't overloaded.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/work-center-load.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Work Center Load Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/work-center-load.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use this report to ensure that loads on work centers don't exceed their available capacity. By analyzing the load percentage and allocated time, you can identify overloaded work centers and take steps to reduce the workload. For example, you might adjust the production schedule or allocate more resources to a particular work center. Additionally, by monitoring the work center load, you can ensure room for contingencies in cases where a work center is loaded to 100%.

Production supervisors use this report to analyze the load percentage and allocated time for work center loads and report them to the manufacturing manager. This information helps ensure that the workload is distributed evenly across all work centers so production runs smoothly.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Work Center Load* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [Load %](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#load)
- [Allocated Time (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#allocated-time-hours)
- [Capacity Available (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#capacity-available-hours)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Calendar Entry
- Production Order Routing Line
- Work Center

# Setting up purchasing

Before you can manage purchase processes, you must configure the rules and values that define the company's purchase policies.

You must define the general setup on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page, which is typically done once during the initial implementation. Learn more in the following section, [Purchases, and payables setup](#purchases-and-payables-setup).

A separate series of tasks related to registering new vendors is to record any special price or discount agreements you have with each vendor.

Finance-related purchase setup, such as payment methods and currencies, are covered in the finance setup section. Learn more at [Setting Up Finance](finance-setup-finance.md). Similarly, inventory-related purchase setup, such as units of measure and item tracking codes, can be found in the [Inventory Setup section](inventory-setup-inventory.md).

## Purchases and payables setup

Before working with purchases and payables, specify on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page how purchase values are posted and the number series used for vendors and purchase documents.

### General settings

On the **General** FastTab, you specify options such as how you want to calculate and post discounts and whether you want to round invoices. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].

Some fields require special attention, such as the **Calc. Inv. Disc. per VAT/Tax ID** field, which specifies whether the invoice discount is calculated according to the tax identifier or the invoice total. Learn more at [Combine VAT posting groups in VAT posting setups](finance-setup-vat.md#combine-vat-posting-groups-in-vat-posting-setups).

Similarly, the **Appln. between Currencies** field can result in small rounding differences when applying entries in different currencies to one another. Learn more at [Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies](finance-how-enable-application-ledger-entries-different-currencies.md).

Also, some fields change their behavior or depend on how other fields are set. For example, the **Check Prepmt. when Posting** feature is influenced by how the **Prepmt. Auto Update** field is set to check for pending prepayments.

Read details about the [**Ext. Doc. No. Mandatory**](#external-document-number) and [**Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory**](#exact-cost-reversing) fields in sections later in this article.

### Number series settings

On the **Number Series** FastTab, you must specify unique identification codes to use for vendors, invoices, and other purchase documents. Numbering is important not only for internal processes, but might also need to follow local regulations. So it might be worth considering setting up all series in the **No. Series** page beforehand instead of creating new ones from the **Purchases & Payables Setup**. Learn more at [Create Number Series](ui-create-number-series.md).

## External document number

[!INCLUDE [ext-doc-no-purch](includes/ext-doc-no-purch.md)]

## Exact cost reversing

The **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** function helps ensure returned goods are valued at the same cost as when they were originally drawn from inventory, using a fixed application instead of following an average or first-in, first-out (FIFO) costing method. Learn more in the [Design Details: Fixed Application](design-details-item-application.md#fixed-application) section. If an extra cost is later added to the original purchase, the program updates the value of the respective purchase return.

With the feature enabled, a return transaction can only be posted by specifying the item ledger entry number in the **Appl.-to Item Entry** field on the purchase return order line. By default, the field isn't displayed on the **Lines** FastTab. To learn how to add fields to pages, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode) section.

# The Data Archive Extension

Over time, your business will accumulate a substantial amount of data, and as an administrator, it's probably a good idea to have a strategy for archiving data. Having lots of data can slow things down, for example, it might take slightly longer to generate reports, or even lock records. Additionally, large amounts of data can lead to increased storage costs.

The Data Archive extension provides a basic framework for archiving and backing up data as part of date compression. Date compression consolidates related entries into a single entry and deletes the originals. Learn more at [Compress Data with Date Compression](admin-manage-documents.md#compress-data-with-date-compression). However, there might be value in keeping that data, so rather than deleting it, you can archive it for later use.

## Start Archiving Data

The extension is pre-installed and available on the **Extension Management**, so you don't need to do anything to get started. The extension is also available on AppSource.

Your data archives are listed on the **Data Archive List** page. Each archive can contain data from multiple tables, and can hold up to 10,000 records. If there are more than 10,000 records in a table, a second archive will be created for the next 10,000 records, and so on. For example, if you archive 10,100 G/L entries, Business Central creates one "G/L Entry" archive for the first 10,000 entries, and then a second archive for the remaining 100 entries.

After you archive data, you can explore it using Microsoft Excel or as a CSV file.

* If you use the Excel option, the workbook will contain one worksheet for each data archive table.
* If you use the CSV option, you'll get a ZIP file that contains one CSV file for each data archive table.

> [!TIP]
> The Excel and CSV options make it easier to use another app or service to move the data to another location, such as Azure Blob storage, or an analysis tool, such as Microsoft Power BI.

The Data Archive extension is used by the following batch jobs for date compression.

|Batch jobs  |
|---------|
|Date Comp. Item Budget Entries |
|Date Compress Bank Acc. Ledger |
|Date Compress Customer Ledger |
|Date Compress FA Ledger |
|Date Compress General Ledger |
|Date Compress Insurance Ledger |
|Date Compress Maint. Ledger |
|Date Compress Maint. Ledger |
|Date Compress Resource Ledger |
|Date Compress VAT Entries |
|Date Compress Vendor Ledger |
|Date Compress Whse. Entries |
|Date Compr. G/L Budget Entries |

To start archiving data when you run one of the batch jobs, turn on the **Archive Deleted Entries** toggle.

## Storage Considerations

The archived data is stored in the **Tenant Media** table. We recommend that you export old archives to, for example, a CSV file and then delete the old archive records.

# Walkthrough: Planning Supplies Manually

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

This walkthrough demonstrates the process of planning supply orders to fulfill new demand. You can initiate supply planning at fixed intervals, for example, every morning or every Monday, or when you are notified by sales or production, depending on the type of demand. In this walkthrough you will use the **Order Planning** page, a simple supply planning tool that is based on manual decision-making instead of parameter-based automatic planning.  

## About This Walkthrough  
 This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

-   Planning a purchase order for manufacturing components.  
-   Planning a transfer order to fulfill sales demand.  
-   Planning a production order for a multilevel item.  

## Roles  
 This walkthrough demonstrates tasks performed by the following user roles:  

-   Production Planner  
-   Purchasing Agent  
-   Sales Order Processor  

## Prerequisites  
 Before you begin this walkthrough, you must install the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The following modifications must be made to the database:  

-   Delete all existing sales orders for bicycles.  
-   Create one sales order for 10 bicycles at EAST location.  
-   Delete all planned and firm planned production orders. Do not delete started orders with entries that are already posted.  

 As a rule, use the suggested data in this walkthrough because this data has the necessary records.  

## Story  
 Eduardo, the Production Planner of a small manufacturing company, is about to plan production and purchase orders to fulfill new sales demand.  

 Because the products have few BOM levels and the flow of orders is relatively low, Eduardo uses the **Order Planning** page to manually create supply orders, one product level at a time.  

 In a more complex manufacturing environment, the planning worksheet is used to plan supply based on item parameters such as rescheduling period, safety lead time, reorder point, and batch calculations of consolidated demand from all product levels.  

## Setting Up the Sample Data  
 The standard CRONUS demonstration company currently has lots of unplanned demand. During the different planning tasks in this walkthrough, you will have to deviate from the realistic business flow by ignoring demand with close due dates and instead use demand with later due dates.  

## Use the Order Planning Page  

The **Order Planning** page can be accessed from several different locations:  

-   Manufacturing, Planning  
-   Sales & Marketing, Order Processing  
-   Purchase, Planning  
-   In addition, you can open this page for a specific production order by choosing the **Planning** action.

### To use the Order Planning page  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Order Planning**, and then choose the related link.  

     When the **Order Planning** page first opens, a plan must be calculated to show the new demand since it was last calculated.  

2.  Choose the **Calculate Plan** action.  

     The planning system analyzes any new demand that has been introduced, such as new sales, changed sales, or production orders.  

     Based on total availability, the quantity needed for each demand line is calculated. This calculation is performed order-by-order. This means that the order which includes the demand line with the earliest due date or shipment date will be calculated first. After that, additional demand lines will be calculated in the same order, regardless of the due date or shipment date.  

3.  Be sure that the **Order Planning** page is maximized and that column fields are resized to show all the default field names.  

     When the calculation is completed, the page displays all unfulfilled demand as collapsed order header lines sorted by earliest demand date.  

     Notice that CRONUS has several orders with unfulfilled demand. Each bold planning line represents an order, sales order, or production order, including at least one order line with insufficient availability.  

4.  In the **Show Demand As** field, select the **All Demand** filter.  

     With the **Demand Type** field, you can choose which order types that you want to display.  

     Orders that do not have availability problems are not shown. If no orders exist when a plan is calculated, a message will display and no planning lines will appear.  

## Planning a Purchase Order to Fulfill Component Demand  
 In this procedure, you create a purchase order for needed manufacturing components.  

### To plan a purchase order to fulfill component need in production  

1.  Expand the first line (choose the + symbol).  
2.  Choose the first demand line, with item **LSU-15**, and then choose the **Show Document** action.  
3.  Close the opened production order to return to the **Order Planning** page.  
4.  In the **Replenishment System** field, select **Purchase**.  

     The default value is from the item card, or SKU card, but you can change it to one of the following options:  

    -   **Purchase** – To create a purchase order.  
    -   **Transfer** – To create a transfer order.  
    -   **Prod. Order** – To create a production order.  

5.  In the **Supply From** field, select one of the following options according to the selected replenishment system:  

    -   **Vendor** – For purchases  
    -   **Location** – For transfers  

     If the field is not filled in, an error message will display when you try to create the supply orders.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the components have a default vendor number set up on the item cards, the lines will be preset.  

6.  Choose the **Supply From**  field.  
7.  On the **Item Vendor Catalogue** page, choose the **New** action, and then select vendor **30000**.  
8.  Choose the **OK** button to return to the **Order Planning** page.  
9. Copy vendor **30000** to the other lines for loudspeaker components on this production order.  

     You are now ready to create a purchase order.  

10. Choose the **Make Orders** action. The **Make Supply Orders** page opens.  
11. On the **Order Planning** FastTab, in the **Make Orders for** field, choose the **Active Order** option.  
12. On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Create Purchase Order** field, choose the **Make Purch. Order** option.  
13. Choose the **OK** button to create purchase orders for all the components of the order.  

     The purchase orders are now created and saved as the last orders in the list of purchase orders.  

## Planning a Transfer Order to Fulfill Sales Demand  
 In this procedure, you will plan for demand from a sales order. Demand lines represent sales lines and not component lines, as in production demand.  

### To plan a transfer order to fulfill sales demand  

1.  Move the pointer to the planning line for order **2008**.  
2.  Expand the line and move the pointer to the demand line.  

     Sales order **2008** is for ten loudspeakers, item **LS-120**, ordered by John Haddock Insurance Co.  

     The item's defined replenishment system and default vendor will display.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  At the bottom of the page, there are four information fields. In the **Earliest Date Available** field, the ten pieces that are needed will be available, on an inbound supply order, nine days later than the current due date. If this is too late for the customer, the **Available for Transfer** field shows 13 pieces of the item at another location. You will want to plan for this stock.  

3.  Choose the **Available for Transfer** field to open the **Get Alternative Supply** page.  
4.  Choose the **OK** button to book the ten items that are available.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  In the demand line, the suggested purchase has been exchanged with a transfer from MAIN location. The **Make Orders** function creates a transfer order from MAIN to the demanded location. The **Substitutes Exists** field works in the same way.  

5.  Choose the **Make Orders** action. The **Make Supply Orders** page opens.  
6.  On the **Order Planning** FastTab, in the **Make Orders for** field, choose the **The Active Order** option.  
7.  On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Create Transfer Order** field, select the **Make Trans. Orders** option.  
8.  Choose the **OK** button to create the transfer order to supply the sales order.  

     The transfer order is now created and saved in the list as the last order in the list of open transfer orders.  

## Planning a Multilevel Production Order to Fulfill Sales Demand  
 In this procedure, you will plan to fulfill sales demand for a produced item with multiple product levels, each creating dependent production demand.  

### To plan multilevel production to fulfill sales demand  

1.  Select the planning line with sales demand for order **1001**, created earlier as prerequisite data.  

     This demand is a sales line, but the item has a defined replenishment system of **Prod. Order**. Proceed to add an extra bell to the component need of each bicycle.  

2.  Choose the **Components** action to open the **Planning Components** page.  
3.  On the line with the Bell item, change the **Quantity per** field from **1** to **2**.  
4.  On the **Order Planning** page, consider your planning alternatives. In this case, you have no alternative means of supply, no transfer, substitute, or later delivery. You must create the suggested supply order, a production order.  
5.  Choose the **Make Orders** action to create the production order.  

     On the **Order Planning** page, notice that the planning line for sales order **1001** no longer exists and that the initial sales demand has been covered.  

6.  Close the **Order Planning** page.  

     Now, you could choose to stay in this view and complete all the planning tasks. Instead, you will now take on the Production Planner role by going to the production order that you just created and access the **Order Planning** page.  

 As a production planner you now must plan a specific production order.  

### To plan a specific production order  

1.  Open the production order **101001**, for ten bicycles, that you just created by using the **Make Orders** function.  
2.  Open the **Prod. Order Components** page to check that the extra bell is reflected on the production order.  
3.  Choose the **Planning** action.  

     The **Order Planning** page opens in a view that is always filtered on the specific production demand. Sales demand is not displayed. You must calculate a plan before you can see any additional demand.  

4.  Choose the **Calculate Plan** action.  

     Notice that four new production orders appear as unplanned production demand derived from order **101001**. The new lines represent new production demand from the subassemblies that must be created to produce the order.  

5.  Choose the **Expand All** action to get an overview of all the production demand for the production orders.  

     To provide additional information about the demand lines, you may want to add the **Demand Quantity** and **Demand Qty. Available** fields to your view.  

     Now you must supply ten of each component.  

     Note that four of the demand lines have replenishment system Prod. Order. These four subassemblies represent the second product level of the bicycle.  

     The default replenishment settings are already filled in and you can proceed to make orders.  

6.  Choose the **Make Orders** action.  

     Before you choose the **OK** button, notice the text on the **Order Planning** FastTab. This text is important because you know that the bicycle has several produced components, subassemblies, in its product structure that might be in demand when you create this production order.  

7.  On the **Make Supply Order** page, in the **Make Orders for** field, choose the **All Lines** option, and then choose the **OK** button to create production orders for the second product level of the order.  

     Note that the top-level production demand for production order 101001 no longer exists. This means that the initial production demand for subassemblies has been planned for.  

     On the **Order Planning** page, you calculate a plan again in order to plan the bicycle structure.  

8.  Choose the **Calculate Plan** action to recalculate the plan as instructed by the embedded Help text.  

     The two new lines represent additional production demand derived from the subassemblies planned in the previous steps. It is suggested that you make two production orders to supply the wheel hubs, one for 10 front hubs and one for 10 back hubs.  

9. Choose the **Expand All** action to get an overview of all the demand for the two production orders.  

     The suggested supply plan indicates that a total of four purchase orders will be created for the components. You decide to make the proposed orders.  

10. Choose the **Make Orders** action.  
11. In the **Make Orders for** field, select the **All Lines** option, and then choose the **OK** button. Check if additional demand exists for the production of the parent item, the bicycle, which is being sold on sales order 1001.  
12. Choose the **Calculate Plan** action.  

     The message indicates that all required items are now supplied. Verify the firm planned production orders that are created.  

13. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Orders**, and then choose the related link.  

     On the **Firm Planned Prod. Orders** page review how start times and end times of individual orders are scheduled according to the product structure. The lowest-level components are produced first. Therefore, you must plan multilevel orders as demonstrated in this planning workflow.

# Invoice projects

During a project, costs from resource usage, materials, and project-related purchases can accumulate. As the project progresses, these transactions get posted to the project journal. It's important to record all costs in the project journal before you invoice the customer. You can invoice customers after the project is finished, or at certain intervals based on an invoicing schedule.

You can invoice:

* Multiple projects using a **Project Create Sales Invoice** task.
* Whole projects, projects within a project, or individual project planning lines using the relevant action in the project pages.
* Combine multiple project planning lines from different projects into a single sales invoice using **Get Project Planning Lines** action on the **Sales Invoice** page.

## To create multiple project sales invoices

You can create an invoice for a project or for one or more project tasks:

* When the work to invoice is complete.
* When you reach the date for invoicing set on an invoicing schedule.

The following procedure shows how to use a batch job to invoice multiple projects.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Create Sales Invoice**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Set filters to specify the projects to invoice.
4. Choose the **OK** button to create the invoices.  

You can review and post created invoices on the **Sales Invoices** page.

> [!NOTE]
> Alternatively, invoice a customer by selecting the project, and then choosing the **Create Project Sales Invoice** action, or use the **Create Sales Invoice** action in the project tasks.

## To create and post project sales invoice from project planning lines

You can create an invoice from a project planning lines, and specify the quantity of the item, resource, or general ledger account.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a relevant project.
3. Select a project task for which the **Project Task Type** field contains **Posting**, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  
4. On a project planning line, in the **Qty. To Transfer to Invoice** field, enter the quantity of the item, resource, general ledger account type that you want to invoice.  
5. Choose the **Create Sales Invoice** action.
6. On the **Project Transfer to Sales Invoice** page, enter the posting date and whether you want to create a new invoice or append this invoice to an existing one.
7. Choose the **OK** button.  
8. On the **Project Planning Lines** page, choose the **Sales Invoices/Credit Memos** action.

    The **Sales Invoice** page opens, showing the quantity that you transferred to the invoice.
9. Make any other changes, and then choose the **Post** action.

> [!NOTE]  
> The procedure is similar for creating, reviewing, and posting a project-related sales credit memo.

## Invoice one customer for multiple project tasks

You can simplify your invoicing process by sending one invoice to a customer for multiple projects. Add project planning lines from multiple projects to a sales invoice in one go. This process is similar to creating a sales invoice from a project planning line and entering a value in the **Append to Sales Invoice No.** field.

Here's an overview of the process.

1. Create a new sales invoice, and fill in the **Sell-to Customer No.** field. If needed, also fill in the **Bill-to Customer No.** and **Currency Code** fields.
2. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Get Project Planning Lines** action. The **Get Project Planning Lines** page shows billable project planning lines from projects for the sell-to customer, bill-to customer, and invoicing currency where the quantity to invoice is more than zero. 
3. Choose the lines you want to add to the invoice, and then choose **OK**.

Repeat these steps if you want to add another set of project planning lines. You can also delete the invoice or its lines and start over.

> [!NOTE]
> There are a couple of limitations:
>
> * The **Get Project Planning Lines** action isn't available on sales orders or sales quotes.
> * You can't filter on the **Ship-to Code** or **Contact No.** fields.

## Issue a credit memo for a project

When a credit is due to a customer for something you invoiced for a project, you can create a credit memo to reimburse them. You can issue a credit memo for job planning lines of the types **Billable** or **Both Budget and Billable**. This credit memo ensures that job planning always reflects the correct planned invoice/credit memo lines for the project before you post sales invoices and credit memos. To learn more about sales credit memos, go to [Process sales returns or cancellations](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md).

To issue a credit memo for a planning line, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
1. Open the project you want to issue a credit memo for.
1. If the **Blocked** field is filled in, clear the field so that you can work with the project.
1. In the **Status** field, change the status from **Completed** to **Open**.
1. Choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.
1. Create a new planning line, and enter the same information as the line you want to credit. However, in the **Quantity** field, enter the same quantity but as a negative value. For example, if the quantity you want to credit is 10, enter a quantity of -10.
1. Choose the **Create Sales Credit Memo** action.
1. On the **Project Transfer to Credit Memo** page, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose **OK**.
1. To review and post the credit memo, on the **Project Planning Lines** page, choose the **Sales invoices/credit memos** action.
1. On the **Sales Credit Memo** page, review the details. If it looks good, post the memo.

# The Late Payment Prediction extension

Effectively managing receivables is important to the overall financial health of a business. To reduce outstanding receivables and help you fine-tune your collections strategy, the extension predicts whether to expect late payments. For example, if a payment is predicted to be late, you might decide to adjust the terms of payment or the payment method for the customer.

## Get started

When you open a posted sales document, a notification displays at the top of the page. To use the Late Payment Prediction Extension, opt in by choosing **Enable** in the notification. Alternatively, you can set up the extension manually. For example, if you regret dismissing the notification.

To enable the extension manually, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Late Payment Prediction Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> If you decide to enable the extension manually, be aware that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will not allow you to do so if the quality of the model is low. The quality of the model indicates how accurate the model's predictions are likely to be. Several factors can impact the quality of a model. For example, there might not have been enough data, or there wasn't enough variation in the data. You can view the quality of the model you're currently using on the **Late Payment Prediction Setup** page. You can also specify a minimum threshold for the model quality.

## View all payment predictions

If you enable the extension, a **Payments Predicted to be Late** tile is available in the **Business Manager** Role Center. The tile displays the number of payments that are predicted to be late, and lets you open the **Customer Ledger Entries** page where you can dig deeper into the posted invoices. There are three columns to pay attention to:  

* **Late Payment** - Indicates whether the payment for the invoice is predicted to be late.
* **Prediction Confidence** - Indicates how reliable you should consider the prediction to be. **High** means that the prediction is at least 90% sure, **Medium** is between 80% and 90%, and **Low** is below 80%.
* **Prediction Confidence %** - Shows the actual percentage behind the confidence rating. By default, this column is hidden, but you can add it if you want. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

> [!TIP]
> The Customer Ledger Entries page shows a FactBox. While you're reviewing predictions, the information in the **Customer Details** section can be helpful. When you choose the invoice in the list, the section shows information about the customer. It also lets you take immediate action. For example, if a customer frequently misplaces their wallet, you can open the Customer card from the FactBox and block the customer for future sales.  

## Design details

Microsoft deploys and operates predictive web services in all regions where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available. Access to these web services is included in your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] subscription. For more information, see the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Licensing Guide. The guide is available for download on the [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central/overview/) website.

The web services work in three modes:

* Train model. The web service trains the model based on the provided dataset.
* Evaluate model. The web service checks whether the model returns reliable data for the provided dataset.
* Predict. Web-service applies the model to the provided dataset to make a prediction.

These web services are stateless, meaning they use data only to calculate predictions on demand. They don't store data.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can use your own predictive web service instead of ours. For more information, see [Create and use your own predictive web service late payment prediction](#AnchorText).

### Data required to train and evaluate the model

For each **Customer ledger entry** that has a related **Posted Sales Invoice**:

* Amount in local currency, including tax
* Payment terms in days are calculated as **Due Date** minus **Posting Date**
* Whether there's an applied credit memo

Additionally, the record has aggregated data from other invoices that are related to the same customer.

- Total number and amounts on paid invoices
- Total number and amounts on invoices that were paid late
- Total number and amounts on outstanding invoices
- Total number and amounts on outstanding invoices that are already late
- Average days late
- Ratio: Number of paid late/paid invoices
- Ratio: Amount paid late/paid invoices
- Ratio: Number of outstanding late/outstanding invoices
- Ratio: Amounts on outstanding late/outstanding invoices

> [!NOTE]
> The information about the customer isn't included in the dataset.

### Standard model and My model

The Late Payment Prediction extension's predictive model is trained on data that represents a range of small to medium-sized businesses. When you start posting invoices and receiving payments, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] evaluates whether the standard model fits your business flow.

If your processes don't match the standard model, you can use the extension but you need to get more data. Just continue to use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> We use a bit of your compute time each week when we evaluate and re-train the model.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] runs training and evaluation automatically when enough paid and late invoices are available. However, you can run it manually whenever you want.

#### To train and use your model

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Late Payment Prediction Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Selected Model** field, choose **My Model**.
3. Choose the **Create My Model** action, to train model on your data.  

## <a name="AnchorText"> </a>Create and use your own predictive web service for late payment prediction

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the model is published by Microsoft and connected to the Microsoft subscription. For other deployment options, you have to create Machine Learning resources in your own Azure subscription. You can find sample steps in the [sample repo](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/MachineLearning). The purpose of this task is to get the API URI and API key.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Late Payment Prediction Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Use My Azure Subscription** check box.
3. On the **Use My Azure Subscription** FastTab, enter the API URL and API key for your model.

> You can also build your own reports and dashboards in Power BI based on your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data. For more information, see [Connecting Your Business Data to Power BI](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md). 

## Prerequisites

Power BI apps require permissions to the tables where data is retrieved and the web services used to retrieve data. The following table lists the web services required for each Power BI app:
    
|App|Web services |
|--|-------------|
|[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] – CRM| <ul><li>Sales Opportunities</li><li>Excel Template View Company Information</li><li>Power BI Report Labels</li></ul>|
|[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] – Finance| <ul><li>PowerBIFinance</li><li>Excel Template View Company Information</li><li>Power BI Report Labels</li></ul>|
|[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] – Sales| <ul><li>Item Sales by Customer</li><li>Sales Dashboard</li><li>Excel Template View Company Information</li><li>Power BI Report Labels</li></ul>|

> [!TIP] 
> An easy way to find the web services is to search for *web services* in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In the **Web Services** page, make sure that the **Publish** field is selected for the web services listed above. For more information, see [Publishing a Web Service](across-how-publish-web-service.md).

## Get ready

Sign up for the Power BI service. If you haven't already signed up, go to [https://powerbi.microsoft.com](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). When you sign up, use your work email address and password.

## Install a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Power BI

1. Open your browser, navigate to [https://powerbi.microsoft.com](https://powerbi.microsoft.com), and sign in to your account.
2. Select **Apps** on the navigation pane.
    
    The **Apps** page appears.

3. On the **Apps** page, select **Get apps** from the upper right corner of the page.
    
    The **Power BI apps** page opens, where you can browse for the apps that are available for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

    ![Navigating to Get apps.](./media/across-how-to-connect-powerbi-d365-content-packs/powerbi-get-data.png)

> [!TIP] 
> You can also access the **Power BI Report** from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Navigate to the Power BI Reports section and **Select reports** on your Home page. Choose either **Services** or **My Organization** from **Get Reports**. The Organization gallery in Power BI or Microsoft AppSource will open, displaying only apps related to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

5. In the **Search** box, enter **Dynamics 365 Business Central**.
6. Select app that you want to use, select **Get it now**, and then **Install**.  

    When completed, the app will be available from **Apps** on the navigation menu in Power BI.

## Connect the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app to your data

1. Under **Apps**, select the Business Central app, then **Connect**.
2. When prompted, fill in the **Company Name** and **Environment** with information about the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] instance that you want to connect to.

    - For **Company Name**, make sure to use the full name, not the display name. You can find the company name in the **Companies** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 
    - For **Environment**, if you haven't created multiple environments, enter **Production**.

3. Select **Next**.
4. Select **Sign-in**.
5. When prompted, enter the user name and password for signing into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
6. Once connected, a dashboard and reports are added to your Power BI workspace. When completed, the tiles show data from your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company.

    ![Select Dynamics 365 Business Central  and select Get it now.](./media/across-how-to-connect-powerbi-d365-content-packs/powerbi-workspace-dashboard-report-dataset.png)

## Fixing problems

The Power BI dashboard relies on the published web services that are listed above. It shows data from the demonstration company or your own company if you import data from your current finance solution. However, if something goes wrong, this section provides a workaround for the most typical issues.  

### You don't have a Power BI account

A Power BI account hasn't been set up. You must have a license to get a valid Power BI account. Also, you must have previously signed into Power BI to create your Power BI workspace.  

### Message: There are no enabled reports. Select report to see a list of reports that you can display.

This message appears if the default report failed to deploy to your Power BI workspace. Or the report deployed but didn't successfully refresh. If this problem happens, navigate to the report in your Power BI workspace, select **Dataset**, **Settings**, and then manually update the credentials. Once the dataset successfully refreshes, navigate back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and manually select the report from the **Select Reports** page.

### You need a Power BI Pro license to install the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Power BI

You need a [Power BI Pro license](/power-bi/service-features-license-type) to share your content, and the people you share it with do too. The content must be in a workspace in a [Premium capacity](/power-bi/service-premium-what-is). For more information, see [Ways to share your work in Power BI](/power-bi/service-how-to-collaborate-distribute-dashboards-reports).  

### "Parameter validation failed, please make sure all parameters are valid"

This error indicates that one more of the parameters aren't valid.

- The specified environment parameter doesn't match any existing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] production or sandbox environment.
- The specified company parameter doesn't match any existing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] companies. Verify the company name in the **Companies** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- If connecting to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you entered a URL that isn't valid. You can verify the URL in the **Web Services** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  
- A port isn't open to allow the request through your firewall.

### Can't sign in

If you get a "login failed" error after using your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user credentials to sign in, then you're probably experiencing one of the following issues:

- The account that you're using doesn't have permissions to retrieve the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data from your account. Verify that you have permissions to the required data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and try again.
- You've selected an authentication type other than Basic, if connecting to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.
- You haven't entered a valid user name or password.

### Message: Your data source can't be refreshed because the credentials are invalid. Please update your credentials and try again

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the problem might be that the OData URL is only exposed to the local network.

### Incorrect company name

A common mistake is to enter the company display name instead of the company name. To find the company name search for **Companies**. Then use the **Name** field when entering your company name.

### The key didn't match any rows in the table

If you enter a non-valid company name during the connection process, you may get the error message "The key didn't match any rows in the table". Provide the correct company name and try connecting again.

### Historical data appears to be missing

Once the Power BI app installs and your data show in Power BI, you notice that not all your data displays. The datasets are filtered to only return the previous 365 days of data. This default is in place to help make the reports faster.  

### I only see data for a single company

The Power BI app will only display data from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company that was defined when the Power BI app was installed. Data from additional companies can be added to the reports by adding new queries that use different companies as the data source.  

### What now?

- Try [asking a question in the Q&A box](/power-bi/service-q-and-a-tips) at the top of the dashboard.
- [Change the tiles](/power-bi/service-dashboard-edit-tile) in the dashboard.  
- [Select a tile](/power-bi/service-dashboard-tiles) to open the underlying report.  
- By default, your dataset isn't scheduled to refresh. You can change the refresh schedule or try refreshing it on demand using **Refresh Now**. For more information, see [Configuring scheduled refresh](/power-bi/refresh-scheduled-refresh).

# Track Email Message Exchanges Between Salespeople and Contacts

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Get more out of the communications between your salespeople and customers by turning email exchanges into actionable opportunities. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can work with Exchange Online to keep a log of the inbound and outbound messages. You can view and analyze the contents of each message on the **Interaction Log Entries** page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Exchange Online must be on the same tenant.

## To set up email logging

### Set up public folders and rules for email logging in Exchange Online

[!INCLUDE[admin-setup-email-public-folder](includes/admin-setup-email-public-folder.md)]

Next, you connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Exchange Online.

### Set Up a shared mailbox and rules for email logging in Exchange Online

> [!NOTE]
> These steps require administrator access for Exchange Online.

Prepare a shared mailbox in the Exchange admin center. Alternatively, you can also use Exchange Online PowerShell. For more information, see [Create a shared mailbox](/microsoft-365/admin/email/create-a-shared-mailbox) or [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true).

> [!NOTE]
> If you use Exchange Management PowerShell, your changes are available in the Exchange admin center after a delay. The delay might be several hours.

### Add a user account for members of the shared mailbox

The account that you use for email logging is an Exchange Online account. The scheduled job uses the account to connect to the shared mailbox and process emails. This account shouldn't be associated with a specific person. Add the email account to the members for the shared mailbox. For more information, see [Use the EAC to edit shared mailbox delegation](/exchange/collaboration-exo/shared-mailboxes#use-the-eac-to-edit-shared-mailbox-delegation).

### Allow other users to see logged emails

You can allow another user to open an email message in Exchange that is related to an interaction log entry from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To do that, give the user ``Read`` permission to the **Archive** folder in the shared mailbox. For more information, see [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true).

### Create mail flow rules

Mail flow rules look for specific conditions on messages and take action on them. Create two mail flow rules based on the information in the following table. For more information, see [Manage mail flow rules in Exchange Online](/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/manage-mail-flow-rules?preserve-view=true) and [Mail flow rule actions in Exchange Online](/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/mail-flow-rule-actions?preserve-view=true).

|Purpose  |Name  |Apply this rule if...  |Do the following...  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|A rule for incoming email     |Log Email Sent to This Organization|The sender is located outside the organization, and the recipient is located inside the organization|BCC the email account that is specified for the shared mailbox.|
|A rule for outgoing email     |Log Email Sent from This Organization|The sender is located inside the organization, and the recipient is located outside the organization.|BCC the email account that is specified for the shared mailbox.|

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only processes messages in the Inbox folder in the shared mailbox. If a rule moves messages from the Inbox to another folder, those messages will not be processed. Additionally, messages in the Junk Mails folder are also ignored.

## Set Up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to log email messages

Get started with email logging in two easy steps:

1. Connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Exchange Online for your Microsoft 365 subscription. Exchange Online handles your email messages. We made this step easy by providing an assisted setup guide. You just need your administrator credentials for your administrator account in Microsoft 365. To start the guide, go to the **Assisted Setup** page, and then select the **Set up email logging** guide.  

2. Make sure that the email addresses for your sales people and contacts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are valid. To do that, for each customer or salesperson, open the **Contact** or **Salesperson/Purchaser** card and have a look in the **Email** field.

    > [!Tip]
    > After you complete the steps in the guide you can check whether the connection was successful. Search for **Email Logging**, choose **Actions**, and then choose **Validate Setup**.

## View email message exchanges in the Interaction Log

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an entry on the **Interaction Log** page each time a salesperson and a contact exchange an email message. To view the interaction log, open the **Contact** card for the person, choose **Related**, then **History**, and then **Interaction Log Entries**. There are a few things you can do with each entry in the log, for example:

* View the content of the email message that was exchanged by selecting **Process** and then **Show Attachments**.
* Turn an email exchange into a sales opportunity. If an entry looks promising, you can turn it into an opportunity and then manage its progress toward a sale. To turn an email exchange into an opportunity, choose the entry, then **Process**, and then **Create Opportunity**. For more information, see [Managing Sales Opportunities](marketing-manage-sales-opportunities.md).

## Mailbox and folder limits in Exchange Online

There are mailbox and folder limits in Exchange Online, such as limits for folder sizes and the number of messages. For more information, see [Exchange Online limits](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits#storage-limits) and [Limits for public folders in Exchange Server](/Exchange/collaboration/public-folders/limits?view=exchserver-2019&preserve-view=true).

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] stores logged email messages in a folder in Exchange Online. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also stores a link to each logged message. The links open the logged messages in Exchange Online from the Interaction Log Entries, Contact Card, and Salespersons Card pages in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If a logged message is moved to another folder, the link is broken. For example, a message might be moved manually, or Exchange Online might automatically start AutoSplit when a storage limit is reached.

The following steps can help you avoid breaking links to messages in Exchange Online.

1. Don't move existing messages to another folder after you change settings for your email logging setup. Keeping existing messages put preserves the links. Links to messages in the new folder are valid.
2. Avoid reaching the mailbox and folder limits. If you're about to reach a limit, take the following steps:
    1. Set up a new shared mailbox in Exchange Online.
    2. Update your email flow rules in Exchange Online.
    3. Update your email logging setup in Business Central accordingly

## Connect on-premises versions to Microsoft Exchange

You can connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to Exchange on-premises or Exchange Online for email logging. For both versions of Exchange, settings for the connection are available on the **Marketing Setup** page. For Exchange Online, you can also use an assisted setup guide.

<!-- [!IMPORTANT]
> The new experience doesn't support a connection to Exchange on-premises. If you must use Exchange on-premises, do not enable the feature update for the new experience.

## Connect to Exchange on-premises
<!--
## [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)
To connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to Exchange on-premises, on the **Marketing Setup** page, you can use **Basic** as the **Authentication Type**, and then enter credentials for the user account for Exchange on-premises. Then turn on the **Enabled** toggle to start logging email.

## [New Experience](#tab/new-experience)
The new experience does not support connections to Exchange on-premises.
-->
## Connect to Exchange Online

To connect to Exchange Online, you must register an application in Microsoft Entra ID. Provide the application ID, key vault secret, and the redirect URL to use for the registration. The redirect URL is preset and should work for most installations. For more information, see [To register an application in Microsoft Entra ID for connecting from Business Central to Exchange Online](#to-register-an-application-in-microsoft-entra-id-for-connecting-from-business-central-to-exchange-online). 

You must also use **OAuth2** as the **Authentication Type**. You must also register an application in Microsoft Entra ID. Provide the application ID, key vault secret, and the redirect URL to use for the registration. The redirect URL is prepopulated and should work for most installations. For more information, see [To register an application in Microsoft Entra ID for connecting from Business Central to Exchange Online](#to-register-an-application-in-microsoft-entra-id-for-connecting-from-business-central-to-exchange-online).

You must set up your installation to use HTTPS. For more information, see [Configuring SSL to Secure the Business Central Web Client Connection](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/configure-ssl-web-client-connection). If you're setting up your server to have a different home page, you can change the URL. The client secret is saved as an encrypted string in your database.

### To register an application in Microsoft Entra ID for connecting from Business Central to Exchange Online

The following steps assume that you use Microsoft Entra ID to manage identities and access. For more information, see [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app). 

1. In the Azure portal, under **Manage**, choose **Authentication**.
2. Under **Redirect URL**, add the redirect URL that is suggested on the **Email Logging** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If the redirect URL field on the Email Logging page is empty, find the suggested redirect URL on the **Assisted Setup** page. To open the page, on the **Email Logging** page, choose **Actions**, and then **Assisted Setup**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not specify the redirect URL, you can do so later by choosing **Add a platform**, and then choosing **Web** to add the web application and the redirect URL.

3. Under **Manage**, choose **API permissions**, and choose **Microsoft Graph**, and then choose **Delegated permissions**.
4. Use the search box to find and select **Mail**, and then add the **Mail.ReadWrite.Shared** permission.
5. Under **Manage**, choose **Certificates & Secrets**, and then create a new secret for your app. You use the secret either in the **Client Secret** field on the **Email Logging** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
6. Choose **Overview**, and then find the **Application (client) ID** value. This value is the client ID of your application. You must enter it either in the **Client ID** field on the **Email Logging** page.
7. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], set up email logging on the **Email Logging** page, or use the **Assisted Setup** guide for assistance.

### Use Another Identity and Access Management Service

If you aren't using Microsoft Entra ID to manage identities and access, you need some help from a developer. If you prefer to store the app ID and secret in a different location, you can leave the Client ID and Client Secret fields blank and write an extension to fetch the ID and secret from the location. You can provide the secret at runtime by subscribing to the OnGetEmailLoggingClientId and OnGetEmailLoggingClientSecret events in codeunit 1641 "Setup Email Logging."

## To start logging email

1. To start logging email, on the **Email Logging** page, turn on the **Enabled** toggle.
2. Sign in with the Exchange Online account that the scheduled job uses to connect to the shared mailbox and process emails.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are not prompted to sign in the the Exchange Online account, it might be because your browser is blocking pop-ups. To sign in, allow pop-ups from https://login.microsoftonline.com.

## To stop logging email

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Email Logging**, and then choose the related link.
2. Turn off the **Enabled** toggle.

## To change the user account used for email logging

### [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the account that the scheduled job uses to connect to the shared mailbox and process emails. This account must have access to both [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Exchange Online.
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Email Logging**, and then choose the related link. 
3. Choose **Related**, and then **Job Queue Entry**.
4. Restart the **Email Logging** job.

### [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Email Logging**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Actions**, and then **Renew Token**.
3. Sign in with the Exchange Online account that the scheduled job uses to connect to the shared mailbox and process emails.

# Analytics in purchasing

Businesses capture lots of data during daily activities that supports business intelligence (BI) for purchasing managers:

- Purchase quotes
- Purchase orders
- Purchase invoices

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's purchasing data:

- Power BI reports for purchasing
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using open in Excel)
- Built-in sales reports

Each of these features has advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data analysis and the role of the user. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to gain purchasing insights.

## Analytics needs in purchasing

When you think about the analytics needs in purchasing, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes different analytics needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use the data in different ways. For example, people in asset management and finance interact with data differently than people in sales.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role              | Data aggregation  | Typical ways to consume data                          | 
|-------------------|-------------------| ----------------------------------------------------- |
|COO / CSO / CFO / CEO    | Performance data  | KPIs <br> Dashboards <br> Financial reports           |
|Purchasing Manager      | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports <br> Ad-hoc analysis      | 
|Purchasing Officer / Purchasing Agent | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports <br> On-screen task data |


## Using Power BI to monitor purchasing KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In procurement, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their procurement organization's performance:

- Outstanding Amount (excluding VAT)
- Amount Received but Not Invoiced (excluding VAT)
- Period-over-Period Purchases Growth (Amount or in percentage)
- Purchases by Item/Vendor/Location/Purchaser
- Actual purchases vs Budget

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases Overview Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-overview.png":::

These purchasing KPIs, and more, are available in the Power BI Purchasing app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Power BI Purchasing app](purchases-powerbi-app.md).

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-purchasing-app](includes/power-bi-purchasing-app.md)]

## Use financial reporting to produce financial statements and KPIs (related to purchasing)

The **Financial Reporting** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. Specifically for purchasing, you can set up financial reports on the general ledger (G/L) accounts that you use to track purchase postings.

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence. A dimension is data that you can add to an entry as a parameter. Dimensions let you group entries that have similar characteristics, such as customers, regions, and products, and easily retrieve these groups for analysis. Among other purposes, use dimensions when you define analysis views and create financial reports. To learn more, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

To learn more about financial reports, go to [Prepare Financial Reports with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md).

## Finance reporting across business units or legal entities (related to purchasing)

Some organizations use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in multiple business units or legal entities. Others use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in subsidiaries that report to parent organizations. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives accountants tools that help them transfer general ledger entries from two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company. Specifically for purchasing management, you might want to consolidate general ledger entries for your purchasing accounts to track sales KPIs across business units or legal entities.

To learn more, go to [Company consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of purchasing data

Sometimes, you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The **Data Analysis** feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **Purchase Orders**, **Posted Purchase Invoices**, **Vendor Ledger Entries**, or **General Ledger Entries**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-vendor-ledger-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Customer Ledger Entries page." lightbox="media/data-analysis-vendor-ledger-entries.png":::

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

:::image type="content" source="media/open-in-excel-vendor-ledger-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Customer Ledger Entries data using Excel." lightbox="media/open-in-excel-vendor-ledger-entries.png":::

> [!TIP]
> If you configure OneDrive for system features, the Excel workbook opens in your browser.

To learn more about how to do ad-hoc analysis on purchasing data, go to [Ad hoc analysis of purchasing data](ad-hoc-analysis-purchasing.md).

## Built-in reports for purchasing

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports, tracing functions, and tools to help purchasing organizations report on their data.

[!INCLUDE [purchasing_reports_report_explorer](includes/purchasing-reports-report-explorer-include.md)]

## On-screen purchasing analytics

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you purchasing overviews and tasks to do. Here's an example to get you started:

- [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md)  
- [Calculate Dates for purchases](purchasing-date-calculation-for-purchases.md)
- [View purchase ledger entries](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md#viewing-ledger-entries)

### Show purchasing-related general ledger entries and balances from the Chart of Accounts page

The Chart of Accounts page shows all general ledger accounts with aggregated numbers posted to the general ledger. From this page, you can do things like:  

- View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.  
- Review a list of posting groups for that account.
- View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

Specifically for purchasing, you can create a view on the Chart of Accounts page that only shows the accounts you use to post purchasing entries.

:::image type="content" source="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png" alt-text="Example of how the Chart of Accounts page shows finance insights" lightbox="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png":::

To learn more, go to [Understand the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md#the-chart-of-accounts).

### Analyze data by dimensions (related to purchasing)

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as purchase orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from.  

So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department or location, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts structure.

To learn more, go to [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

# The tax file formats (DK) extension
If you engage in trade with companies, or internal branches or subsidiaries, in other EU countries/regions you must report information about the activities to SKAT and to Statistics Denmark. If you use the VAT and Intrastat reporting features in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], this extension can ensure that the file you export is compatible with requirements from these organizations. The extension adds the MS-ECSL Report Export File and Intrastat Export Lines submission codeunits to your VAT Report configuration, so you can export data in the new format right away.

The extension is free, you just need to install it.

# Summarize records with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Use Copilot to get a quick summary of a record, such as a customer, item, or sales order, directly in the page's FactBox pane. Copilot uses AI to generate two or three concise bullet points that provide details and insights about the data tailored to your role in Business Central. The summary helps you understand the data and identify areas that need attention. Interact with the summary to link to data sources and open related pages, so you can act on your data.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## Prerequisites

The **Summarize** capability is active, and you have the required permissions to use it. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md)

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Availability

This feature is available on most card and document pages, like a **Customer card** or a **Sales Order**. If it's not available on a page as expected, it might be hidden. [Learn how to show or hide the summary](#show-or-hide-the-summary).

## Summarize a record

1. Open the record.
1. In the **Summary** part at the top of the FactBox pane on the right side, select the ![Shows the down arrow head icon to expand the FactBox pane.](media/down-arrow-head.png) **Expand summary** icon to generate the summary.

   ![Shows the summary part in the FactBox pane.](media/summary-with-copilot-collapsed.svg)

   > [!TIP]
   > If the **Summary** part is expanded when the page opens, Copilot generates the summary immediately without your interaction. If the **Summary** is expanded when you close the page, Copilot automatically generates the summary the next time you open the page for a record.

1. The summary appears in a moment for you to review and interact with.

   ![Shows the summary part opened in the FactBox pane.](media/summary-with-copilot-opened.svg)

   Review the summary before making any decisions. The content is AI-generated and might be incorrect or inaccurate.

   - Explore the data

     Summaries are based on data from the record, FactBoxes that display related information, and related pages that show aggregated information like statistics pages. Some summary text is linked, so you can go to the data source. Select the links to view details or take action based on the summarized data.

   - Get more insights

     Select the **Show more** button to get more information about the record. The Copilot pane opens on the right side and generates more points of interest.

   - Regenerate the summary

     Select the **Regenerate summary** icon to generate a new summary, updated with changes to the record and related data. The same summary appears for a few minutes before a new one is automatically generated, but you can request a summary from the latest data at any time.

## Show or hide the summary

Business Central remembers whether you collapsed, expanded, or hid the **Summary** the last time you had the page open.

- To show the **Summary** part, select <kbd>...</kbd> **Show more options for FactBox pane** > **Summary** at the top of the FactBox pane.
- To hide the **Summary** part, select <kbd>...</kbd> **Show more options for FactBox pane** > **Summary** at the top of the **Summary** part.
- Because the **Summary** part is in the FactBox pane, it's hidden if the FactBox pane is collapsed. To show the FactBox pane, select the ![Shows the icon to expand the FactBox pane.](media/expand-factbox-icon.png) **Expand FactBox pane** icon.

# Set up payment methods

Payment methods define the way you prefer for customers to pay you, and how you like to pay your vendors. The method can vary for each customer or vendor. Examples of typical payment methods are **bank**, **cash**, **check**, or **account**.

You can assign a payment method to customers and vendors so that the same method is always used on the sales and purchase documents you create for them. If needed, you can change the method on the sales or purchase document. For example, if you want to pay a particular purchase invoice in cash rather than by check. The default payment method assigned to the vendor doesn't change.

The same payment methods are used for sales and purchase documents. For example, a _cash_ payment method is used to make payments and to receive them. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] knows that when you're creating a sales invoice you expect to receive payment, and the opposite for purchase invoices.

Credit memos for returns, however, are exceptions because money is flowing in the opposite directions, from you to your customer and from your vendor to you. Therefore, a default payment method isn't assigned to credit memos. There is, however, a workaround. You can specify terms of payment for the customer or vendor. Though the **Calc. Pmt. Disc. on Cr. Memos** field isn't intended for this workaround, if you choose the checkbox on the **Payment Terms** page a default payment method is added when you create a credit memo. <br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=34d91385-2010-4135-b47d-2062660ede80]

## To set up a payment method

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a few payment methods that businesses often use. You can, however, add as many as you need.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Methods**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

Optionally, add payment terms to your payment method. For more information, see [Set Up Payment Terms](finance-payment-terms.md).  

## To assign a payment method to a customer or vendor

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer** or **Vendor**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Payment Method Code** field, choose the method to use by default for the customer or vendor.

## Audit changes to payment methods

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your payment method setup. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)] 

The following table lists the table for payment methods and its ID.

# Sales by Location (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Sales by Location** report provides an overview of sales performance at locations. It showcases key metrics such as total sales amount, total quantity sold, and cost of goods sold. You can break down the metrics further by specific items sold at each location.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-location.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Location Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-location.png":::

## Use the report

Leadership and management teams use the report to help them track revenue and cost breakdown per location. The report is valuable for any organization that operates across multiple locations.

For COOs of retail companies with multiple warehouse locations, it's important to have a high-level view of the sales performance of each location. The overview can help you make informed decisions about resource allocation and expansion plans. You can quickly view the total revenue generated by each location and identify under-performing locations. This information helps you make better decisions about resource allocation to ensure that the organization is operating efficiently and effectively across all locations.

Regional managers who oversee several warehouse locations can track revenue and cost breakdown per location, identify areas for improvement, and adjust sales strategies. Analyze the total sales amount, quantity sold, cost of goods sold, and gross profit for each location to find out which locations perform well and which ones need improvement.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- **[Sales Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)**  
- **[Sales Quantity](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-quantity)**  
- **[Cost Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount)**  
- **[Cost Amount Non-Inv](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount-non-inv)**  
- **[Gross Profit](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit)**  
- **[Gross Profit Margin](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit-margin)**

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Location
- Item
- Value Entry
- Sales Line

# Set up the E-Documents connector with external endpoints

This article explains how to set up E-Documents functionality when connected to external endpoints.

Before you use the functionality that this article describes, you must install the **E-Document Core** app and one of the E-Documents connectors with external endpoints apps. You can use these apps for default integration with the external, non-Microsoft, access points to automate the e-document flow. Because these apps represent only some of the selected connectors, you aren't limited to existing integrations.

## Install an E-Documents connector  

To install an E-Documents connector, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link.
2. Choose the **Install E-Documents integration from AppSource** action to open the **Microsoft AppSource apps** page.
3. Choose the connector you want, and then select the **View on AppSource** action.
4. Install the app from the AppSource.

## Set up the connection

[!INCLUDE[e-documents connectors](includes/edocuments-connectors-include.md)]

Based on the endpoint service provider, the next steps might be different. You can find details about set up parameters for all available service providers [here](finance-edocuments-connectors.md).

## Set up company information

Before you start using e-documents, update your **Company Information** page by completing the following steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then select the related link.
2. In addition to filling in the usual fields, you must also fill in the following fields:

    | Field name | Description |
    |---|---|
    | SWIFT Code | Specify the SWIFT code (international bank identifier code) of your primary bank. |
    | Bank Branch No. | Specify the bank's four-digit branch number. |
    | VAT Registration No. | Specify the company's value-added tax (VAT) registration number. |

3. Close the page.

## Set up customers to receive e-documents

To enable customers to receive your e-documents, complete the following steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the **Customer** card.
3. In addition to filling in the usual fields, in the **GLN** field, specify the customer you send electronic documents to.
4. Turn on the **Use GLN in Electronic Documents** toggle to indicate whether to use the global location number (GLN) as an identification number in electronic documents.
5. Close the page.

## Other setup

Before you start to work with e-documents, set up the e-document **workflows** and **document sending profiles** to use your workflows. After the service connection is established, you can start to use your e-document solution.

## Available service providers

Microsoft wants to encourage access point providers to add their connectors on top of our **E-Document Core** app.

The following list of access point providers are covered by default:  

- Avalara
- B2BRouter
- Logiq
- Pagero
- SignUp

Microsoft has no contractual obligations with these providers. Therefore, you must make a contract with them to get the necessary credentials. The services might require extra licensing or payments for their services.

# Managing Marketing Campaigns
Having a strong marketing plan in place enables you to identify, attract, and retain customers. A marketing plan consists of various campaigns and other interactions in connection with your sales and marketing activities. While planning a campaign, you need to decide which contacts to target, what type of campaign (such as trade show or direct mail), and what salespeople will perform each task.

Each campaign consists of various activities or tasks. You can combine multiple task, for example tasks that each represent a step, in activities. Activity tasks are related to each other by a date formula. Individual tasks can only be assigned to salespeople. Activities can be assigned to opportunities, salespeople, groups of sales people, and contacts. For more information, see [Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Cycle Stages](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md).

## Defining individual campaigns
Before you can create a campaign, you must set up *campaign status codes*. Using these codes will help you manage your campaigns by assigning a status to the campaign. As you work through the stages of a campaign, you are able to see what step a campaign is at and what step comes next. You set up campaign status codes on the **Campaign Status** page.

You can create a campaign card for each campaign that you want to keep track of. You can also view these campaign cards to view general information about your campaigns.
You can delete campaign entries, such as if the entry records an action that has been canceled. Only canceled campaign entries can be deleted.

### Selecting the target audience
After you have created a campaign, you can start creating segments that specify the target audience of the campaign. For more information, see [Managing Segments](marketing-segments.md).

### Registering discount percentages
When you have set up your campaign, decided what segments you want the campaign to cover, and set the starting and ending dates, you register the discount percentage that the customer will receive on the individual items on the lines on the **Sales Line Discounts** page. You can also register the sales prices for the individual items on the lines on the **Sales Prices** page. You can access both pages from the campaign card.

 When you have set up the sales prices/line discounts and the segments on the campaign card, you must activate them so that the campaign prices/discounts will be reflected on the lines.

> [!NOTE]  
>   In order to activate the sales prices/line discounts, you must specify if the whole segment or only some contacts are targets of the campaign. If the sales prices/line discounts covers all the contacts in the segment, select the **Campaign Target** field on the **Campaign** FastTab of the **Segment** card.

If the sales prices/line discounts are not to be offered to all the contacts in the segment, you can clear the **Campaign Target** field for the relevant contacts. If you cannot see this field, you can add it to your view. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Conducting campaigns
As a campaign runs, all interactions with your contacts, or segment, are recorded so that you can get statistics and other information about the costs and success rates of the campaign.

Campaigns are conducted by salespeople, and you must create activities to represent each task and assign them to the relevant salespeople. For more information, see [Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Cycle Stages](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md).

# Prepare financial reporting with financial data and account categories

The **Financial Reports** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. The results display in charts and reports in your Role Center, such as the Cash Flow chart, and the Income Statement and Balance Sheet reports. You access these two reports, for example, with the **Financial Statements** action in the Business Manager and Accountant home pages.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides sample financial reports you can use right away as templates. You can also set up your own reports to specify the figures to compare. For example, you can create financial reports to calculate profit margins using dimensions such as departments or customer groups. The number of financial reports you can create is unlimited and require no involvement of a developer.  

## Prerequisites for financial reporting

Setting up financial reports requires an understanding of the structure of your chart of accounts. There are three key concepts that you likely need to pay attention to before you design your financial reports:

- Map G/L posting accounts to G/L account categories.
- Design how you use dimensions.
- Set up G/L budgets.

G/L account categories simplify your financial report definitions and make them more resilient to changes in the chart of accounts structure. Learn more at [Use G/L account categories to change the layout of your financial statements](bi-row-definitions.md#use-gl-account-categories-to-change-the-layout-of-your-financial-statements).

Setting up dimensions allows you to slice and dice your financial data in ways that make sense for your organization. Learn more at [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

If you want to view general ledger entries as percentages of budget entries, you must create G/L budgets. Learn more at [Create G/L Budgets](finance-how-create-budgets.md).

## Financial reports

Financial reports arrange accounts from your chart of accounts in ways that make data easier to present. You can set up various layouts to define the information you want to extract from the chart of accounts. Financial reports also provide a place for calculations that can't be made directly in the chart of accounts. For example, you can create subtotals for groups of accounts and then include that total in other totals. Another example is to calculate profit margins on dimensions such as departments or customer groups. Additionally, you can filter general ledger entries and budget entries, for example, by net change or debit amount.

> [!NOTE]
> Mathematically, think of a financial report as defined by two things:
>
> - A vector of row definitions that define what needs to be calculated.
> - A vector of column definitions that defines the data for the calculation.
>
> The financial report is then the outer product of these two vectors, where each cell value is calculated according to the formula in the row applied to the data definition from the column.

:::image type="content" source="media/financial-report-definition.svg" alt-text="Shows how a financial report is constructed from a row definition and a column definition." lightbox="media/financial-report-definition.svg":::

The **Financial Reports** page shows how all financial reports follow a pattern that consists of the following attributes:

- Name (code)
- Description
- Row definition
- Column definition
- Internal description (introduced in [!INCLUDE[2025_releasewave1_name](includes/2025_releasewave1_name.md)])

:::image type="content" source="media/financial-reports.png" alt-text="Shows how all financial reports are constructed from a row definition and a column definition." lightbox="media/financial-reports.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> The sample finance reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] aren't ready to use out of the box. Depending of the way you set up your G/L accounts, dimensions, G/L account categories, and budgets, you need to adjust the sample row and column definitions and the finance reports they're used in to match your setup.

You can also use formulas to compare two or more financial reports and column definitions. Comparisons let can do the following things:

- Create customized financial reports.
- Create as many financial reports as you need, each with a unique name.
- Set up various report layouts and print the reports with the current figures.

To learn more about comparisons, go to [When to use a comparison period formula and comparison date formula in a column definition](bi-design-financial-reports.md#when-to-use-a-comparison-period-formula-and-comparison-date-formula-in-a-column-definition).

## Learning path: Create financial reports in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central

Want to learn how to create budgets, and then use financial reports, dimensions, and row and column definitions to generate the financial reports that businesses typically need?

Start on the following learning path [Create financial reports in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](/training/paths/create-financial-reports-dynamics-365-business-central).

## Create a new financial report

You use financial reports to analyze general ledger accounts or to compare general ledger entries with budget entries. For example, you can view the general ledger entries as percentages of the budget entries.

The financial reports in the standard version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might not suit your business needs. To quickly create your own financial reports, start by copying an existing one, as described in step 3 below.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Financial Reports** page, choose the **New** action to create a new financial report name. Alternatively, to reuse settings from an existing financial report, choose the report, and then choose the **Copy Report Definition** action.
1. In the **Name** field, enter a short name for the report

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can't change the name later.
1. In the **Display Title** field, enter a description of the report.
1. Choose a row definition and a column definition.
1. Optionally, choose analysis views for the row and column definitions.
1. Choose the **View Financial Report** action to access more properties on the financial report.
1. On the **Options** FastTab, you can edit the report title, change the row and column definitions, write an internal description, set the formatting for negative numbers, and define how to show dates. Dates can be a Day/Week/Month/Quarter/Year hierarchy, or use accounting periods. To learn more, go to [Comparing accounting periods using period formulas](bi-column-definitions.md#comparing-accounting-periods-using-period-formulas).
1. On the **Dimensions** FastTab, you can define dimension filters for the report.
1. If you want the report output to include an introductory and/or a closing paragraph, add them from the *Definitions* menu (these fields are available from the [!INCLUDE[2025_releasewave1_name](includes/2025_releasewave1_name.md)] and later).  
1. You can now preview the report in the area below the **Dimensions** FastTab.

> [!NOTE]
> When you open a financial report in View or Edit mode, the Filter pane is available. Don't use the Filter pane to set filters for the data in your report. Such filters can cause errors or might not actually filter the data. Instead, use the fields on the **Options** and **Dimensions** FastTabs to set up filters for the report.

### Adding introductory and/or closing paragraphs

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/introduced_in_2025rw1.md)]

If you want the report output to include an introductory and/or a closing paragraph, you can use the **Edit introductory/closing paragraphs** action on the **Definitions** menu. When you export the report to PDF or Excel, these paragraphs display before and after the report body.

### Choosing a format for negative numbers

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/introduced_in_2025rw1.md)]

If you want to control how negative numbers show in the report output (both on-screen and in PDF), you use the **Negative Amount Format** action on the **Options** FastTab to choose your preferred format. The format can be a minus sign or parentheses.

### Create or edit a row definition

Row definitions in financial reports provide a place for calculations that can't be made directly in the chart of accounts. For example, you can create subtotals for groups of accounts and then include that total in other totals. You can also calculate intermediate steps that aren't shown in the final report.

Row definitions also provide settings for formatting your report. Most of the options provide visual definition to reports when people view or preview them on their monitors, or print them.

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the formatting options don't carry over when you export them to Excel. If you often export reports to Excel, you might skip the formatting here and format the report in Excel instead.

To learn more, go to [Row definitions in financial reporting](bi-row-definitions.md).

### Create or edit a column definition

Use column definitions to specify the columns to include in the report. For example, you can design a report layout to compare net change and balance for the same period this year and last year. You can have up to 15 columns in a column definition. For example, multiple columns are useful for displaying budgets for 12 months with a column that shows the total.

To learn more, go to [Column definitions in financial reporting](bi-column-definitions.md).

## Using dimensions in financial reports

In financial analysis, a dimension is data you add to an entry as a kind of marker. This data is used to group entries with similar characteristics, such as customers, regions, products, and salesperson, and easily retrieve these groups for analysis. You can use dimensions on entries in journals, documents, and budgets.

Each dimension describes the focus of analysis. So, a two-dimensional analysis, for example, would be sales per area. By using more than two dimensions when you create an entry, you can carry out a more complex analysis. An example of a complex analysis is exploring sales per sales campaign per customer group per area. That gives you greater insight into your business, such as how well your business is operating, where it is or isn't thriving, and where you should allocate more resources. That insight helps you make more informed business decisions. To learn more, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

## Set up financial reports with overviews

You can use a financial report to create a statement that compares general ledger figures with budget figures.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.
1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select a financial report.  
1. Choose the **Edit Row Definition** action  
1. On the **Row Definition** page, in the **Name** field, select the default financial report name.
1. Choose the **Insert G/L Accounts** action.  
1. Select the accounts you want to include in your statement, then choose **OK**.

    The accounts are inserted in your financial report. If you want, you can also change the column definition.  
1. Choose the **Edit Financial Report** action.  
1. On the **Financial Report** page, on the **Dimensions** FastTab, set the budget filter to the filter name you want to use.  
1. Choose **OK**.  

Now you can copy and paste your budget statement into a spreadsheet.  

## Best practices for working with financial report definitions

Financial report definitions aren't versioned. When you change a report definition, the old version is replaced when your change saves to the database. The following list contains some best practices for working with financial report definitions:

- If you add report definitions, choose a good code and fill in the description field with a meaningful text while you still know what you use the report for. This information helps your coworkers (and your future self) to work with the report and perhaps changing the report definition.
- Before you change a report definition, consider taking a copy of it as a backup, just in case your change doesn't work as expected. You can either just copy the definition (give it a good name), or export it. To learn more, go to [Import or export financial report definitions](#import-or-export-financial-report-definitions).
- If you need a fresh copy of a definition that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides, an easy way to get one is to create a new company that only contains setup data. Then, export the definition and import it in the company where the definition needs a refresh.

## Import or export financial report definitions

You can import and export financial report definitions as RapidStart configuration packages. For example, configuration packages are useful for sharing information with other companies. The package is created in a .rapidstart file, which compresses the contents.

> [!NOTE]
> When you import financial report definitions, existing records with the same names as those you are importing are replaced with the new definitions. The configuration package for a report definition won't overwrite any existing row or column definitions that are used in the report definition.

To import or export financial report definitions, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.
1. Choose the financial report, then choose the **Import Financial Report** or **Export Financial Report** action, depending on what you want to do.

To learn more about how to import or export financial report row or column definitions, go to the following articles: 

- [Import or export financial reporting row definitions](bi-row-definitions.md#import-or-export-financial-reporting-row-definitions), or
- [Import or export financial reporting column definitions](bi-column-definitions.md#import-or-export-financial-report-column-definitions)

## Integrate financial reports with Excel

You can integrate a financial report with an Excel workbook template, adjust the layout to suit your needs, and then update the Excel template with data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this integration makes it easier to generate your monthly and yearly financial statements in a format that works for you.

To learn more, go to [How to integrate financial reports with Excel](finance-financial-reporting-view-a-report.md#integrate-financial-reports-with-excel).

## Print and save financial reports

You can print financial reports using your device's printing services. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also offers options to save reports as PDF files. 

To learn more, go to [How to print and save financial reports](./finance-financial-reporting-view-a-report.md#print-and-save-financial-reports).

# Report and document layouts overview

A report layout controls content and format of the report. For example, the data fields in the report dataset that appear on the report, how they're arranged, the text style, images, and so on. From [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can change which layout is used on a report, create new layout, or modify the existing layouts.

> [!NOTE]  
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the term "report" also covers externally facing documents, such as sales invoices and order confirmations that you send to customers as PDF files.

You can also use report layouts to add content to email messages. For example, report layouts can save time and help ensure consistency by reusing the same content when you communicate with your customers. To use custom report layouts with email, the file type for the layout must be Word. You can't use the RDLC file type. Learn more in [Set Up Reusable Email Texts and Layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts).

## Introduction

A report layout sets up the following things:

* The label and data fields to include from the dataset of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report.
* The text format, such as font type, size, and color.
* The company logo and its position.
* General page settings, such as margins and background images.

You can set up multiple layouts for a report, and then switch between them to suit different reporting needs.

<!--You can use one of the built-in report layouts or you can create custom report layouts and assign them to your reports as needed. Learn more in [Create a Custom Report or Document Layout](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).-->

There are two important aspects of report layouts that influence how you work with them:

* The **Layout Type** indicates the kind of file that the layout is based on.
* The **Layout Source** indicates the origin of the layout.

## Layout types

There are four types of layouts that you can use for reports:

* Word
* RDLC
* Excel
* External

### Word

Word layouts are based on Word documents (.docx file type). Word layouts enable you to design report layouts by using Microsoft Word. A Word layout determines the report's content - controlling how that content elements are arranged and how they look. A Word layout document typically uses tables to arrange content, where the cells can contain data fields, text, or pictures.

[![Example of a word report layout document for Business Central.](media/word-layout-overview.png)](media/word-layout-overview.png#lightbox)

<!--![Example of a word report layout document for Business Central.](media/nav_wordreportlayout_edit_in_word_example.png) -->

Learn more in [Work with Word Layouts](ui-how-add-fields-word-report-layout.md).

### Excel

Excel layouts are based on Microsoft Excel workbooks (.xlsx file type). They let you create reports by using familiar Excel features for summarizing, analyzing, and presenting data with tools like formulas, PivotTables, PivotCharts, and more.

[![Shows the an example of an Excel layout.](media/excel-layout-2.png)](media/excel-layout-2.png#lightbox)

Learn more in [Work with Excel Layouts](ui-excel-report-layouts.md).

### RDLC

RDLC layouts are based on client report definition layout files (.rdl or .rdlc file types). These layouts are created and modified by using SQL Server Report Builder or Microsoft RDLC Report Designer. The design concept for RDLC layouts is similar to Word layouts, where the layout determines what fields to show and how they're arranged. However, designing RDLC layouts is more advanced than Word layouts.

[![Shows the an example of an RDLC layout.](media/rdlc-layout-overview.png)](media/rdlc-layout-overview.png#lightbox)

Learn more in [Work with RDLC Layouts](ui-rdlc-report-layouts.md).

### External

An external layout type refers to an advanced type designed for specific reports. The reports and the layouts themselves are typically provided by partners, not Microsoft. The actual file type of the layout varies depending on the provider.

Learn more in [Developing a Custom Report Render](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-report-custom-render).

## Layout sources

In addition to the type, layouts are further divided into three categories, based on their source or origin.

* Extension layouts

   Extension layouts are layouts that are part of an extension installed in a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment. These layouts are typically standard layouts provided by Microsoft, for example, in the base application. Or, they could be layouts that are included in extensions from other software providers. You can identify extension layouts on the **Report Layouts** page because the **Extension** column shows the extension name and publisher.

* User-defined layouts

   The other source of layouts is the people who use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. People with the right permissions can add new layouts in various ways. For example, you could start from an existing extension layout or a user-defined layout. You can identify user-defined layouts on the **Report Layouts** page because the **Extension** column is blank.

   Learn more in [Get Started Creating Report Layouts](ui-get-started-layouts.md).

* Custom layouts (obsolete)

  Custom layouts are also layouts that users create. The difference is that these layouts are created from the now obsolete **Custom Report Layouts** page, and they can only be Word and RDLC type. Although you can still create custom layouts, they're being phased out in favor of user-defined layouts.

  Learn more in [(Obsolete) Create and Modify Custom Report Layouts](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).

To learn more about which type is best for you, go to [Decide what type of layout you want](ui-get-started-layouts.md#decide).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> One important thing to remember is that you can't modify extension layouts from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client. For example, you can't change the layout name or type, or upload and replace it with another version. If you try, an error message displays. You can create a user-defined or custom layout based on the extension layout instead.

<!--
### Built-in and custom report layouts

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in layouts. Built-in layouts are predefined layouts that are designed for specific reports. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reports will have a built-in layout as either an RDLC report layout, Word report layout, or in some cases both. You can’t modify a built-in report layout from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] but you use them as a starting point for building your own custom report layouts.

Custom layouts are report layouts that you design to change the appearance of a report. You typically create a custom layout based on a built-in layout, but you can create them from scratch or from a copy of an existing custom layout. Custom layouts enable you to have multiple layouts for the same report, which you switch among as needed. For example, you can have different layouts for each [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company, or you can have different layouts for the same company for specific occasions or events, like a special campaign or holiday season.

Deciding on whether to use a Word, Excel, or RDLC layout type will depend on how you want the generated report to look and your knowledge of tools for creating the layouts, like Word, Excel, and SQL Server Report Builder.

* The general design concepts for Word and RDLC layouts are similar. However each type has certain design features that affect how the generated report appears in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This means that the same report might look different when using the Word report layout compared to the RDLC report layout.

* The process for setting up Word, Excel, and RDLC report layouts on reports is the same. The main difference is in the way you modify the layouts. Word and especially Excel layouts are typically easier to create and modify than RDLC report layouts because you use Word and Excel. RDLC report layouts are modified by using SQL Server Report builder, which targets more advanced users.

* Not all reports and document have a dataset that is optimized for use with an Excel layout. For example, aggregations and complex calculations work best with RDLC or Word layouts. The same is true for documents.

For information about how to switch the layout currently used on a report, see [Set the Layout Used by a Report](ui-set-report-layout.md).

-->

## View report layout lifecycle telemetry

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to send data to an Application Insights resource in Microsoft Azure about the actions users take on report layouts, like adding, modifying, deleting, and more. Then, using Azure Monitor, you create reports and set up alerts on the gathered data. Learn more in the following articles of the Developer and IT Pro help:

* [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry - Enabling Application Insights](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json#enable)
* [Analyzing report layout lifecycle telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-report-layout-lifecycle-trace?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json)

# Work with assembly BOMs

You use assembly bills of materials (BOMs) to structure parent items that must be assembled from components with little to no resource use. An assembly BOM can be used, for example, to sell a parent item as a kit consisting of component items.

Use assembly orders to make finished items from components in a process that one or more basic resources can perform, which aren't machine or work centers, or without any resources. For example, an assembly process could be to pick two wine bottles and one coffee sack and pack them as a gift item.  

An assembly BOM is the master data that defines which component items go into an assembled end item and which resources are used to assemble the assembly item. When you enter an assembly item and a quantity on an assembly order, the assembly order lines are filled in according to the assembly BOM. The order has one assembly order line per component or resource. Learn more at [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md).

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also supports production BOMs. Production BOMs differ from assembly BOMs because they involve more complex procedures, such as resource usage, production routing, and work or machine centers. Learn more about the differences at [Work with Bills of Material](inventory-how-work-BOMs.md) and [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).

## To create an assembly BOM

To define an item that consists of other items, and perhaps the resources that assemble the item, you must create an assembly BOM.  

Assembly BOMs can have multiple levels, which means that a component on the assembly BOM can be an assembly item itself. In that case, the **Assembly BOM** field on the assembly BOM line contains **Yes**.

Special requirements apply to items on assembly BOMs regarding availability. Learn more at [To see the availability of an item by its use in assembly BOMs](inventory-how-availability-overview.md#to-view-the-availability-of-an-item-by-its-use-in-assembly-or-production-boms).

There are two parts to creating an assembly BOM:

- Setting up a new item.
- Defining the BOM structure of the assembly item.

1. Set up a new item. Learn more at [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

   Proceed to enter components or resources on the assembly BOM.  
2. On the **Item Card** page for an assembly item, choose the **Assembly** action, then choose the **Assembly BOM** action.
3. On the **Assembly BOM** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> Assembly items can have variants, just like any other item, which helps you keep your list of products shorter. Learn more about the feature at [Manage Product Variants](inventory-item-variants.md).

## To edit assembly BOMs

You can edit the lines on an assembly BOM at any time. However, the BOM might be in use by ongoing sales or assemblies of the parent. Changing the BOM might affect those activities. Choose the **Where-Used** action to explore the items that use it and whether sales or assembly orders might be affected.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Yes** value in the **Assembly BOM** column.
3. On the **Assembly BOM** page, choose the **Edit List** action, then change any field as needed.

## To view components and resources indented according to the BOM structure

From the **Assembly BOM** page, you can open a separate page that shows the components and any resources indented according to their BOM position under the assembly item.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for an assembly item. (The **Assembly BOM** field on the **Items** page contains **Yes**.)
3. On the **Item Card** page, choose the **Assembly** action, then choose the **Assembly BOM** action.
4. On the **Assembly BOM** page, choose the **Show BOM** action.

## To replace the assembly item with its components on document lines

From any sales and purchase document that contains an assembly item, you can use a special action to replace the line for the assembly item with new lines for its components. This action is useful, for example, if you want to sell the components as a kit that represents the assembly item.

The **Explode BOM** action is also available on the **Assembly BOM** page as a way to view subassembly items on an assembly BOM.

> [!CAUTION]  
> When you have used the **Explode BOM** action, you can't easily undo it. You must delete the sales order lines for the components and then reenter a sales order line for the assembly item.

The following procedure is based on a sales invoice. The same steps apply to other sales documents and all purchase documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, then choose the related link.
2. Open a sales invoice that contains a line for an assembly item.
3. Choose the line for an assembly item, then **Explode BOM** line action.

All fields on the sales invoice line for the assembly item are cleared except for the **Item** and **Description** fields. Complete sales invoice lines are inserted for the components and possible resources that comprise the assembly item.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Picking List by Order** report is also changed to show the components only. This means that a warehouse worker picking the parent item, the assembly item, will not see it in the picking list. Learn more at [Print the Picking List](sales-how-print-picking-list.md).

## To calculate the standard cost of an assembly item

You calculate the unit cost of an assembly item by rolling up the unit cost of each component and resource in the item's assembly BOM.

The unit cost of an assembly BOM always equals the total of the unit costs of its components, including other assembly BOMs, and any resources.  

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [bom-standard-cost](includes/bom-standard-cost.md)]

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for an assembly item. (The **Assembly BOM** field on the **Items** page contains **Yes**.)
3. On the **Item Card** page, choose the **Assembly BOM** action.
4. On the **Assembly BOM** page, choose the **Calc. Standard Cost** action.
5. Select one of the following options, then choose the **OK** button.

|Option |Description |
|-------|------------|
|**Top Level**|Calculates the assembly item's standard cost as the total cost of all purchased or assembled items on that assembly BOM regardless of any underlying assembly BOMs.|
|**All Levels**|Calculates the assembly's item standard cost as the sum of:</br></br>* The calculated cost of all underlying assembly BOMs on the assembly BOM.</br>* The cost of all purchased items on the assembly BOM.|

The costs of the items that make up the assembly BOM are copied from the component item cards. The cost of each item is multiplied by the quantity, and the total cost is shown in the **Unit Cost** field on the item card.

You can also calculate and update the standard cost for one or many items on the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page. Learn more at [Update Standard Costs](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md#updating-standard-costs-with-standard-cost-worksheet).

# Work with Production Families

A production family is a group of individual items whose relationship is based on the similarity of their manufacturing processes. By forming production families, some items can be manufactured twice or more in one production, which will optimize material consumption.

In the **Quantity** field on the **Family** page, you enter the quantity that will be produced when the whole family has been manufactured once.

## Example

In punching processes, four pieces of the same item can be produced from one sheet and 10 pieces of another, different, item at the same time. The punching machine will punch all 14 pieces in one step.

Forming production families reduces the scrap quantity because what would normally be leftover scrap, when producing big pieces, will be used instead to produce small items.

## To set up a production family

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Families**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To produce based on a production family

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a new production order. For more information, see [Create Production orders](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md).
3. In the **Source Type** field, select **Family**.  
4. In the **Source No.** field, select the relevant production family.

# Record interactions with contacts

Recording interactions with business contacts consists of these tasks:

* Setting up interaction templates  
* Creating interactions on contacts or segments  
* View and manage recorded interactions  

## Set up interaction templates

Before you can record interactions, you must set up interaction templates. An interaction template is a model that defines the basic characteristics of an interaction. When you record an interaction, you specify the interaction templates it's based on. Settings such as the mode of communication that was used, who initiated the interaction, and its cost, transfer to the interaction.

You set up an interaction template on the **Interaction Templates** page.

When you set up an interaction template, you can add an attachment. For example, you might attach a Microsoft Word document that contains notes from a meeting. To learn more about attachments, go to [Attachments for interactions](marketing-interaction-attachments.md). Repeat the steps to set up as many interaction templates as you want.  

## Create interactions

There are two ways to record interactions:

* You can manually create interactions that are linked to a single contact or to a segment. For more information, see [Create Interactions on Contacts and Segments](marketing-how-create-interactions.md).  
* You can automatically record interactions when you perform actions in the application—for example, when you print an invoice or quote. For more information, see [Automatically Record Interactions with Contacts](marketing-auto-record-interactions.md).

## View and manage recorded interactions

You can view all the recorded interactions that have not been deleted on the **Interaction Log Entries** page. You can open this page by:

* Using the **Search for Page or Report** icon to search on **Interaction Log Entries**.
* Choosing the **Interaction Log Entries** action on a contact or segment.

  The **Interaction Log Entry** page contains the interactions you create manually and the interactions that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records automatically.

Use the Interaction Log Entries page to view the status of interactions and cancel interactions.

You can delete interaction log entries that have been canceled. To delete interaction log entries, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Canceled Interaction Log Entries**, choose the related link, and then fill in the information.

# Use resources for projects

You record the usage of resources in the project journal to keep track of costs, prices, and the work types that are linked to projects. For more information, see [Record Usage for Projects](projects-how-record-job-usage.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can also purchase external resources, for example, to invoice a vendor for work delivered. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

You can also post the usage of a resource in a resource journal. Entries posted in a resource journal have no effect on the general ledger.

## To assign resources to projects

You assign resources to projects by creating project planning lines for the project. For more information, see [Create Projects](projects-how-create-jobs.md).

## To record resource usage for a project

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a relevant project journal batch, and then fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

# Troubleshoot Copilot and agent capabilities

Copilot is an AI-powered functionality in Business Central that assists in various tasks like drafting marketing text and reconciling bank accounts. If you're experiencing trouble with Copilot or other agent capabilities, this article can help you identify and fix common issues.

## Copilot doesn't appear on pages

If Copilot functionality, such as the **Draft with Copilot** action for marketing text suggestions or the **Reconcile with Copilot** action for bank account reconciliation assist, doesn't appear on a page as expected, check the following:

- Make sure that the feature is enabled if it's controlled under Feature Management. [Learn more about feature management](admin-feature-management.md).

- Make sure that the functionality isn't hidden by personalization. [Learn more about personalization](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Copilot appears on pages, but you get an error that it's not activated

When you try to use Copilot and you get an error similar to **Sorry, Copilot is not activated for \[feature\]**, there are a couple things to check:

- First, make sure that the feature is activated on the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. [Learn more about activating Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md#activate-features). 
- Next, make sure that privacy notice statement for Azure OpenAI integration isn't set to **Disagree for everyone**. If it is, change it to **Agree for everyone**. [Learn more about privacy notices](privacy-notices-status.md).

## Copilot capabilities from Microsoft not listed on Copilot & agent capabilities page

If none of the AI features from Microsoft are shown in the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page, it's likely because you have one or more embed apps installed on your environment. Embed apps can offer their own Copilot capabilities, but capabilities published by Microsoft aren't compatible with environments having embed apps.

# Troubleshoot connectivity for Business Central

> **APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online
>
> This feature is currently in preview. The functionality and documentation may change in later releases. If you would like to contribute to the documentation based on your own findings, please select ![Edit article in GitHub.](media/github-edit-pencil.png) **Edit**, and propose changes. Then we'll take a look!

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online includes the **Troubleshooting Connectivity** page that you can use to identify problems with your connection to the online service. There are several things that affect connectivity to Business Central, like the firewall settings of your network or domain name service configuration. The page lets you run a list of checks that diagnose common Business Central connectivity issues. You can use the information to try to fix the problems yourself, or pass it on to your support representative.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Troubleshooting Connectivity** page doesn't test network performance or reliability, like the speed of your connection. It only verifies connectivity to different resources.

## Start the connectivity check 

1. Open an Internet browser.
2. In the address, enter the URL that you use to open Business Central and add `/connectivity` at the end. 

    For example, if you use `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com`, then enter:

    ```http
    https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/connectivity
    ```

    Or, if the URL includes the tenant ID, like `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee`, then you'd enter:

    ```http
    https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee/connectivity
    ```
 
3. On the **Troubleshooting Connectivity** page, choose **Start check**.

    A series of checks is run, and the result of each check is shown:

    - ![Connectivity check succeeded.](media/connectivity-check.png) indicates the check succeeded.
    - ![Connectivity check failed.](media/connectivity-failed.png) indicates the check failed. Review the message below the check for more details.
    - ![Connectivity check was not run.](media/connectivity-blocked.png) indicates the check wasn't run, typically because of a failure of a previous check. Review the message below the check for more details.

4. To run the check again, choose **Restart check**.

The following sections explain the checks that are run, and provide some tips for fixing any problems.

## Basic internet connectivity

Checks that you have connection to the Internet by verifying that you can access a known public domain, like www.bing.com.

# Manage Notifications

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can help you work smarter by notifying you about certain events or changes in status, such as when you are about to invoice a customer who has an overdue balance, or the available inventory is lower than the quantity you are about to sell, for example. These notifications are shown as discreet tips in the context of the task you are doing, and you can choose to ignore the notification or to see details about the issue.  

If you choose to see details for a notification, you can take action to resolve the issue, such as contacting the customer, buying more inventory, and so on. It's your choice what to do, and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives you advice and recommendations.  

Notifications can help untrained users complete unfamiliar tasks, and do not reduce productivity for the more trained user.  

## To turn notifications on or off, and control when they are sent

When you first start with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] all notifications are turned on, but you can turn them on or off, for example, if you aren't interested in a certain event or status.  

Additionally, some notifications let you specify the conditions under which they are sent. For example, if you want to be notified when inventory is running low, but only for items you buy from a certain vendor.  

Turning notifications on or off, and specifying conditions, applies only to you.  

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Settings** icon ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center"), and then choose the **My Settings** action.  
2. On the **My Settings** page, in the **Notifications** field, choose the *Change when I receive notifications.* link.  
3. In the page that appears, turn on or turn off a notification by selecting or clearing the **Enabled** check box.  
4. To specify conditions that trigger a notification, choose the **View filter details** link, and then fill in the fields.

# Adding Contacts to Segments
After you have created a segment and entered basic information about it, you may want to add contacts to the segment. You can do this by filling in the lines on the **Segment** page manually, but it is easier and faster to use the **Add Contacts** action.

## To add a contact to a segment
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Segments**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the segment, and then choose the **Add Contacts** action. The **Add Contacts** batch job page opens.
3. In the **Contact** section, set filters to specify the information by which you want to select contacts.

To enter additional filters, repeat this procedure on each of the remaining sections, and then choose the **OK** button.

If you have added contacts by mistake and want to go back one step, then choose the **Go Back** action.

## To refine the number of contacts
After you have selected the contacts within a segment, you may decide to remove some but keep others. You can manually remove contacts from the lines on the **Segment** page, but it is easier and faster to use the **Refine Contacts** action.

1. Open the segment.
2. Choose **Contacts**, and then choose the **Refine Contacts** action. The **Remove Contacts - Refine** page opens.
3. In the **Contact** section, enter filters to specify the information that you want to use to select the contacts to be removed from the segment.
4. Add additional filters as needed, and then choose the **OK** button.

You can refine a segment as many times as you want. If you have refined the segment by mistake and want to go one step back, choose the **Go Back**.

To see a list of the segment criteria that you have used, in the **General** section, choose the **No. of Criteria Actions** field.

## To reduce the number of contacts
After you have selected the contacts within a segment, you may want to remove some of them. You can do this by manually removing them from the lines in the Segment page, but it is easier and faster to use the Reduce Contacts function to specify which contacts to remove, and to use the Refine Contacts function to specify which contacts to keep.

1. Open the segment.
2. Choose Contacts, and then choose the **Reduce Contacts** action. The **Remove Contacts - Reduce** page opens.
3. In the **Contact** section, enter filters to specify the information that you want to use to select the contacts to be removed from the segment.
4. Add additional filters as needed, and then choose the **OK** button.

You can reduce a segment as many times as you want. If you have refined the segment by mistake and want to go one step back, then choose the **Go Back** action.

# Ad-hoc analysis of sales data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze sales data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "My customers" or "Sales statistics," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages for ad-hoc analysis of sales processes:

- [Sales Orders](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9305&layout=analysis)
- General Ledger Entries
- [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis)
- Item Ledger Entries
- Posted Sales Invoices
- Sales Return Orders

## Sales ad-hoc analysis scenarios

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of sales scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [Sales (expected sales volume)](#example-sales-expected-sales-volume) | Analyze your expected sales volume. | [Sales Orders](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9305&layout=analysis) | **Sell-to Customer Name**, **Sell-to Customer No.**, **No.** , **Amount**, **Document Date Year**, and **Document Date Month**. |
| [Sales (Customer sales by volume)](#example-sales-customer-sales-by-volume) | Get an overview of the customers that purchase the most, or that owe the most. | [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis) | **Customer Name**, **Document No.**, **Amount**, and **Remaining Amount**. |
| [Finance (Accounts Receivables)](#example-finance-accounts-receivables) | See what your customers owe you, for example, broken down into time intervals for when amounts are due. | [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis) | **Customer Name**, **Due Date**, and **Remaining Amount**. |

## Example: Sales (expected sales volume)

To analyze your expected sales volume and sales amounts for unshipped orders for each customer by year or month, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Sales Orders](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9305&layout=analysis) list and turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field).
1. Turn on **Pivot** mode (located directly above the **Search** field).
1. Drag the **Sell-to Customer Name**, **Sell-to Customer No.**, and **No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area. Drag the fields in that order.
1. Drag the field **Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. Drag the **Document Date Year** and **Document Date Month** fields to the **Column Labels** area. Drag the fields in that order.
1. To do the analysis for a given year or quarter, apply a filter in the **Additional Filters** menu. The menu is on the right of the page, just below the **Columns** menu.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Expected sales volume** or something that describes this analysis for you.

## Example: Sales (Customer sales by volume)

To produce an overview of the customers that purchase the most or that owe the most, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis) list, and switch on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field).
1. Drag the **Customer Name** field to the **Row Groups** area, and the **Document No.** field below it.
1. Choose the **Amount** and **Remaining Amount** fields.
1. To do the analysis for a given year or quarter, apply a filter in the **Additional Filters** menu. The menu is on the right of the page, just below the **Columns** menu.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Customer by sales volume**, or something that describes this analysis for you.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-customer-ledger-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Customer Ledger Entries page." lightbox="media/data-analysis-customer-ledger-entries.png":::

## Example: Finance (Accounts Receivables)

To see what your customers owe you, maybe broken down into time intervals for when amounts are due, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis) list and turn on analysis mode.
1. On the **Columns** menu, remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field).
1. Turn on **Pivot** mode (located directly above the **Search** field).
1. Drag the **Customer Name** field to the **Row Groups** area, and drag the **Remaining Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. Drag the **Due Date Month** field to the **Column Labels** area.
1. To do the analysis for a given year or quarter, apply a filter in the **Additional Filters** menu. The menu is on the right of the page, just below the **Columns** menu.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Aged Accounts by Month**, or something that describes this analysis for you.

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on sales

After you enter information on a sales order and add all the sales order lines, you can post the order. Posting creates a shipment and an invoice. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the customer's account, general ledger, and item ledger entries:

- For each sales order, a sales entry is created on the **G/L Entry** table. An entry is also created in the customer's account in the **Cust. Ledger Entry** table and a general ledger entry is created in the relevant receivables account. In addition, posting the order might result in a VAT entry and a general ledger entry for the discount amount.
- For each sales order line, an item ledger entry is created in the **Item Ledger Entry** table (if the sales lines contain item numbers) or a general ledger entry is created in the **G/L Entry** table (if the sales lines contain a general ledger account). In addition, sales orders are always recorded in the **Sales Shipment Header** and **Sales Invoice Header** tables.

To learn more about posting sales, go to [Posting sales](ui-post-sales.md).

# Detecting Mandatory Fields

When you enter data, you might see a red asterisk next to a field. The asterisk means that the field is required for a certain process. For example, you're about to post a transaction, but you've not filled in an important field.

The visual clue doesn't force you to fill in the field. The red asterisk is a reminder that you're blocked from completing a process.

## Examples

On the **Customer Card** page, the red asterisk appears in the **Name** field, in the **Tax Area Code** field, and in the posting group fields to indicate that you can't post a sales transaction for the customer unless the fields are filled.

On the **Item Card** page, the red asterisk appears in the **Description** field to indicate that you can't enter the item on a document line, such as a sales order, unless this field is filled.

# Managing intercompany transactions

Businesses with more than one legal entity with separate accounting functions can benefit from intercompany transactions. For example, it's useful for businesses that have subsidiaries in multiple international markets or regions. Or, an organization might have several companies but lack the equivalent number of accounting and administrative teams. Intercompany transactions simplify and streamline business processes and transactions between companies in the intercompany partnership.

After you specify the customer and vendor relationships for intercompany transactions, partners enter information one time in sales and purchase documents. A corresponding document is created at the other partner involved in the transaction. Mapping the chart of accounts and dimensions helps ensure that information appears in the right places.  

There are four main benefits to the intercompany functionality:  

* Increased productivity as a result of time saved and simplified transactions  
* Minimized mistakes with one-time entry of information and system-wide, automated updates  
* Transparent audit trail and full visibility into business activities and transaction histories  
* Efficient transactions with affiliate and subsidiary companies  

## Streamline the flow of business activities  

Intercompany transactions let you distribute sales and purchasing documents and general journal entries to all of your satellite offices, sales offices, or subsidiary companies. Distributing transactions saves time and increases efficiency throughout the organization by reducing data entry. It cuts down on the need to send, receive, print, and archive sales and purchasing documents.  

You're in full control of all transaction documents. For example, you can reject a document sent to you and use the **Reverse Journal Postings** and **Undo Receipts/Shipments** actions to make corrections. Or, when making a purchase from a partner or subsidiary company, you can update the purchase order as long as the selling company hasn't shipped the goods.  

When you enter a transaction, you don't need to specify the accounts to use. You just choose the intercompany partner. The intercompany functionality creates general journal lines that balance the books of both companies involved in the transaction. In receivables and payables, you assign an intercompany partner code to any customer or vendor. From that moment on, all orders and invoices for transactions between these companies produce corresponding documents in the partner company. The result is correctly balanced accounts.  

Intercompany focuses on sales and purchase documents and general journal lines, and allows transactions between multiple [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] databases. For example:

* Different countries/regions
* Multiple currencies
* Different charts of accounts
* Different dimensions
* Different item numbers  

Intercompany transactions use several types of entries and documents:  

* General journal entries
* Purchase and sales orders
* Purchase and sales invoices
* Credit memos
* Return orders

When you set up intercompany transactions, you create a list of intercompany partners, an intercompany chart of accounts, and intercompany dimensions. Afterward, you can create transactions in intercompany general journals.

> [!NOTE]
> The general journal by itself doesn't include currencies. It converts all amounts to the local currency at the current exchange rate.

After you set up business partners as customers and vendors, and assign them intercompany partner codes, they can exchange intercompany purchase and sales documents, including items and item charges. 

> [!NOTE]
> Companies can't use intercompany to exchange all types of data. Purchase invoices are not submitted to business partners through intercompany processes. However, sales invoices that are submitted through intercompany processes will be created as purchase invoices in the receiving company.

Consolidating financial data might be relevant for intercompany processes. For more information, see [Consolidating Financial Data from Multiple Companies](finance-consolidated-company-reporting.md).

title: Design Details Central Concepts of the Planning System
description: Planning suggests actions for the user to take based on the demand/supply situation and the items' planning parameters.

# Design Details: Central Concepts of the Planning System

The planning functions are contained in a batch project that first selects the relevant items and period to plan for. Then, according to each item's low-level code (BOM position), the batch job calls a code unit that calculates a supply plan. The code unit balances supply-demand sets and suggests actions for the user to take. The suggested actions appear as lines in the planning worksheet or the requisition worksheet.  

![Contents of the Planning Worksheets page.](media/design_details_central_concepts_of_the_planning_system_planning_worksheets.png "Contents of the Planning Worksheets page")  

The planner of a company, such as a purchaser or a production planner, is presumed to be the user of the planning system. The planning system assists the user by performing the extensive but rather straightforward calculations of a plan. The user can then concentrate on solving the more difficult problems, such as when things differ from normal.  

The planning system is driven by anticipated and actual customer demand, such as forecast and sales orders. Planning calculations suggest actions you can take regarding supply from vendors, assembly or production, or transfers from other warehouses. An example of a suggested action could be to create new supply orders, such as purchase or production orders. If supply orders already exist, the suggested actions could be to increase or expedite orders to meet changes in demand.  

Another goal of the planning system is to ensure that the inventory does not grow unnecessarily. If demand decreases, the planning system will suggest that the user postpones, decreases quantity, or cancels existing supply orders.  

A code unit contains the planning logic and the following functions:

* MRP and MPS
* Calculate Net Change Plan
* Calculate Regenerative Plan

However, the supply plan calculation involves different sub-systems.  

The planning system doesn't include dedicated logic for capacity leveling or fine scheduling. Those types of scheduling work are done separately. The lack of direct integration between the two areas also means that substantial capacity or schedule changes will require you to rerun planning.  

## Planning parameters

The planning parameters that you set for an item or a group of items control which actions the planning system will suggest in various situations. Define planning parameters for each item to control when, how much, and how to replenish.  

You can also define planning parameters for any combination of item, variant, and location by setting up a stock-keeping unit (SKU) for each combination, and then specifying individual parameters. Learn more at [Design Details: Handling Reordering Policies](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md) and [Design Details: Planning Parameters](design-details-planning-parameters.md).  

## Planning starting date

The planning system helps you avoid having open orders in the past and suggested actions that aren't possible. Planning treats all dates before the starting date as a frozen zone. The following rule applies to the frozen zone:  

* All supply and demand before the starting date of the planning period is considered part of inventory or shipped. In other words, it assumes that the plan for the past runs according to the given plan. Learn more at [Process orders before the planning start date](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#process-orders-before-the-planning-start-date).  

## Dynamic order tracking (pegging)

Dynamic order tracking and its simultaneous creation of action messages in the planning worksheet isn't a part of the supply planning system. When a demand or supply is created or changed, dynamic order tracking links the demand and the quantities to cover it in real time.  

For example, if you enter or change a sales order, dynamic order tracking instantly searches for supply to cover the demand. The supply could be from inventory or from an expected supply order (such as a purchase order or a production order). When it finds a supply source, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] links the demand and supply. You access the link on view-only pages from the document lines. When supply can't be found, the dynamic order tracking system creates action messages in the planning worksheet with supply plan suggestions.  

Dynamic order tracking helps you assess whether to accept supply order suggestions. From the supply side, it shows the demand that created the supply. From the demand side, it identifies the supply that should cover the demand.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_dynamic_order_tracking.png" alt-text="Example of dynamic order tracking.":::

Learn more at [Design Details: Reservation, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).  

In companies with a low item flow and less advanced product structures, it might be enough to use dynamic order tracking for supply planning. However, in busier environments, the planning system should be used to ensure a properly balanced supply plan.  

### Dynamic order tracking versus the planning system

It might be hard to differentiate between the planning system and dynamic order tracking. Both features display output in the planning worksheet by suggesting actions that the planner should take. However, the way this output is produced differs.  

The planning system deals with the entire supply and demand pattern of an item. It considers all levels of the BOM hierarchy along the timeline. Dynamic order tracking only addresses the situation of the order that activated it. When balancing demand and supply, the planning system creates links in a user-activated batch mode. Dynamic order tracking creates the links automatically when you enter a demand or a supply. For example, when you create a sales or purchase order.  

Dynamic order tracking links demand and supply on a first-come-first-served basis when you enter data. This basis can lead to disorder in priorities. For example, a sales order entered first with a due date next month might be linked to the supply in inventory. The next sales order due tomorrow may cause an action message to create a new purchase order to cover it. The following image shows this scenario.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_dynamic_order_tracking_graph.png" alt-text="Example of order tracking in supply planning 1.":::

The planning system deals with demand and supply for items in a prioritized order. The order is prioritized according to due dates and order types. That is, on a first-needed-first-served basis. It deletes all order tracking links that were created dynamically and re-establishes them according to due date priority. When the planning system has run, it has solved all imbalances between demand and supply, as illustrated below for the same data.

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_planning_graph.png" alt-text="Example of order tracking in supply planning 2.":::  

After you run planning, the Action Message Entry table doesn't contain any action messages. Those messages are replaced by the actions suggested in the planning worksheet. Learn more at [Order Tracking Links during Planning](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#serial-and-lot-numbers-are-loaded-by-specification-level).  

## Sequence and priority in planning

The sequence of the calculations in your plan is important for getting the project done in a reasonable amount of time. The prioritization of requirements and resources also plays an important role in getting the best results.  

The planning system is demand-driven. High-level items should be planned before low-level items because they might generate demand for lower-level items. For example, plan retail locations before distribution centers because the retail location might include demand from the distribution center. On a detailed balancing level, if a released supply order can cover a sales order the system shouldn't create a new supply order. A supply with a specific lot number shouldn't be allocated to cover a generic demand if another demand requires this specific lot.  

### Item priority / low-level code

In a manufacturing environment, the demand for a finished, sellable item will result in derived demand for components that comprise the finished item. The bill-of-material structure controls the component structure and can cover several levels of semi-finished items. Planning an item at one level will cause derived demand for components at the next level. This hierarchy will eventually result in derived demand for purchased items. The planning system plans for items in order of their ranking in the total BOM hierarchy. The system starts with finished sellable items at the top level and continues down the product structure to the lower-level items (according to the low-level code).  

The following image shows the sequence in which [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests supply orders at the top level. It assumes the suggestions were accepted and shows lower-level items as well.

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_bom_planning.png" alt-text="Planning for bills of material.":::

To learn more about manufacturing considerations, go to [Load inventory profiles](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#load-inventory-profiles).  

#### Optimizing performance for low-level calculations

Low-level code calculations can affect system performance. To reduce the effect, you can turn off the **Dynamic low-level code calculation** toggle on the **Manufacturing Setup** page. When you do, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests that you create a recurrent job queue entry to update low-level codes daily. You can ensure that the job will run outside working hours by specifying a start time in the **Earliest Start Date/Time** field.

You can also speed up low-level code calculations by turning on the **Optimize low-level code calculation** toggle on the **Manufacturing Setup** page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you choose to optimize performance, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use new calculation methods to determine low-level codes. If you have an extension that relies on the events used by the old calculations, the extension might stop working.

### Locations / transfer-level priority

Companies with more than one location might need to plan for each location individually. For example, an item's safety stock level and its reordering policy might differ from one location to another. You must specify the planning parameters per item and location.  

You can use SKUs to specify individual planning parameters. An SKU can be regarded as an item at a specific location. If you haven't defined a SKU for that location, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the parameters set on the item card. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates a plan for active locations only, where there's demand or supply for a given item.  

Any item can be handled at any location, but [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has a strict approach to the concept of locations. For example, a sales order for an item at one location can't be fulfilled by stock from another location. The quantity on stock must first be transferred to the location specified on the sales order.

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_sku_planning.png" alt-text="Planning for stock-keeping units.":::

Learn more at [Design Details: Transfers in Planning](design-details-transfers-in-planning.md).  

### Order priority

Within a given SKU, the requested or available date represents the highest priority; the demand of today should be dealt with before the demand of the coming days. But apart from this kind of priority, the different demand and supply types are sorted according to business importance to decide which demand should be satisfied first. On the supply side, the order priority determines the source of supply to apply first. Learn more at [Prioritize orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#prioritize-orders).  

## Demand forecasts and blanket orders

Forecasts and blanket orders both represent anticipated demand. The blanket order, which covers a customer's intended purchases over a specific period of time, acts to lessen the uncertainty of the overall forecast. The blanket order is a customer-specific forecast on top of the unspecified forecast, as illustrated in the following image.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_forecast_and_blanket.png" alt-text="Planning with forecasts.":::

Learn more at [Forecast Demand is Reduced by Sales Orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#forecast-demand-is-reduced-by-sales-orders).  

## Planning assignment

All items should be replanned for when the demand or supply pattern has changed since the last time a plan was calculated. For example, if you enter a new sales order or change an existing one, recalculate the plan. Other reasons for replanning include a change in forecast or safety stock quantity. Changing a bill-of-material by adding or removing a component would most likely also indicate a change, but for the component item only.  

The planning system monitors such events and assigns the appropriate items for planning.  

For multiple locations, the assignment happens at the item level per location combination. If a sales order has been created at only one location, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the item at that location for planning.  

The reason for selecting items for planning is a matter of system performance. If an item's demand-supply pattern hasn't changed, the planning system won't suggest any actions to take. Without the planning assignment, the system would have to perform the calculations for all items to find out what to plan for. To learn more about the reasons to assign items for planning, go to [Design Details: Planning Assignment Table](design-details-planning-assignment-table.md).  

The following are the planning options that are available:  

* **Calculate Regenerative Plan** calculates all selected items, whether it's necessary or not.  
* **Calculate Net Change Plan** calculates only the items that have had a change in their demand and supply pattern and, therefore, have been assigned for planning.  

Some people believe that net change planning should be performed on the fly, for example, when sales orders are entered. However, planning on the fly could be confusing because dynamic order tracking and action messaging are also calculated on the fly. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers real-time available-to-promise control. It provides pop–up warnings when you enter sales orders and the current supply plan can't fulfill the demand.  

The planning system only plans for the items that you've prepared with appropriate planning parameters. Otherwise, it assumes that you'll plan the items manually or semi-automatically by using the Order Planning feature. To learn more about the automatic planning procedures, go to [Design Details: Balancing Demand and Supply](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md).  

## Item dimensions

Demand and supply can carry variant codes and location codes that must be respected when the planning system balances demand and supply.  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] treats variant and location codes as item dimensions on a sales order line, inventory ledger entry, and so on. Accordingly, it calculates a plan for each combination of variant and location as if the combination were a separate item number.  

Instead of calculating theoretical combinations of variant and location, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates only the combinations that actually exist in the database. To learn more about how the planning system deals with location codes on demand, go to [Design Details: Demand at Blank Location](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md).  

## Item attributes

Items often have general attributes, such as am item number, variant code, location code, and type of order. However, each demand and supply event can have other specifications, such as serial or lot numbers. The planning system plans these attributes in certain ways depending on their level of specification.  

An order-to-order link between demand and supply is another type of attribute that affects the planning system. Learn more at [Order-to-order links](#order-to-order-links).

### Specific attributes

Some demand attributes are specific and a supply must match them exactly.

* Serial or lot numbers that require specific application (These attributes are required if you turn on the **SN Specific Tracking** or **Lot Specific Tracking** toggle on the **Item Tracking Code Card** page for the item tracking code that is used by the item.)  
* Links to supply orders created manually or automatically for a specific demand (order-to-order links).  

The planning system applies the following rules to these attributes:  

* Demand with specific attributes can only be fulfilled by supply with matching attributes.  
* Supply with specific attributes can also satisfy demand that doesn't specifically require those attributes.  

If inventory or projected supplies can't meet a demand for specific attributes, the planning system suggests a new supply order without regarding planning parameters.  

### Non-specific attributes

Serial or lot-numbered items without a specific item tracking setup might have non-specific serial or lot numbers. These types of numbers can be applied to any serial or lot number. The planning system has more freedom to match, for example, a serialized demand with a serialized supply, typically in inventory.  

Demand-supply with serial or lot numbers, specific or non-specific, are high priority and are exempt from the frozen zone. They'll be part of planning even if they're due before the planning starting date. Learn more at [Serial and lot numbers are loaded by specification level](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#serial-and-lot-numbers-are-loaded-by-specification-level).

To learn more about how the planning system balances attributes, go to [Serial and lot numbers and order-to-order links are exempt from the previous period](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#serial-and-lot-numbers-and-order-to-order-links-are-exempt-from-the-previous-period).  

## Order-to-order links

Order-to-order means that you purchase, assemble, or produce an item for a specific demand. There are several reasons to choose this policy:

* The demand is infrequent.
* The lead-time is insignificant.
* The required attributes vary.  

Another case that uses order-to-order links is when an assembly order is linked to a sales order in an assemble-to-order scenario.  

Order-to-order links are applied between demand and supply in four ways:  

* When the planned item uses the **Order** reordering policy  
* When you use the make-to-order manufacturing policy to create multi-level or project-type production orders (producing components on the same production order)  
* When you create production orders for sales orders with the sales order planning feature  
* When you assemble an item to a sales order (**Assembly Policy** is set to **Assemble-to-Order**)  

The planning system suggests that you only order the required quantity. The purchase, production, or assembly order continues to match the demand. For example, if a sales order is changed in time or quantity, the planning system suggests that you change the supply order accordingly.  

When order-to-order links exist, the planning system doesn't involve linked supply or inventory in the balancing procedure. Planners can decide whether to use the linked supply or a new demand. In the latter case, they can delete the supply order or manually reserve the linked supply.  

Reservations and order tracking links break if a situation becomes impossible. For example, when moving the demand to a date that's earlier than the supply. Order-to-order links adapt to changes in the demand or supply and never break.  

## Reservations

The planning system doesn't include reserved quantities in calculations. For example, if a quantity for a sales order is fully or partially reserved, you can't use the quantity to cover other demand.

The planning system does include reserved quantities in the projected inventory profile. It must consider all quantities to determine when the reorder point has passed and how many to reorder to reach the maximum inventory level. Unnecessary reservations can increase the risk that inventory levels run low because the planning logic doesn't detect reserved quantities.  

The following image shows how reservations can hinder planning.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_reservations.png" alt-text="Planning with reservations.":::

Learn more at [Design Details: Reservation, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).  

## Warnings

The first column in the planning worksheet is for the warning fields. A warning icon displays when you create a planning line for an unusual situation.  

Supply on planning lines with warnings typically won't be modified according to planning parameters. Instead, the planning system suggests a supply to cover the exact quantity of the demand. However, the system can be set up to respect planning parameters for planning lines with certain warnings. The warning information is shown on the **Untracked Planning Elements** page, which also shows order tracking links to non-order network entities. There are three types of warnings:  

* Emergency  
* Exception  
* Attention  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_warnings.png" alt-text="Warnings in the planning worksheet.":::

### Emergency

The emergency warning displays in two situations:  

* When the inventory is negative on the planning starting date  
* When back-dated supply or demand events exist  

If an item's inventory is negative on the planning starting date, the planning system suggests an emergency supply for the negative quantity to arrive on the planning starting date. The warning text states the starting date and the quantity of the emergency order. Learn more at [Handling Projected Negative Inventory](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md#handling-projected-negative-inventory).  

Document lines with due dates before the planning starting date are consolidated into an emergency supply order. The order is planned to arrive on the planning starting date.  

### Exception

The exception warning is displayed if the projected available inventory drops below the safety stock quantity. The planning system will suggest a supply order to meet the demand on its due date. The warning text states the item's safety stock quantity and the date on which it is violated.  

Violating the safety stock level is an exception. It shouldn't happen if the reorder point is set correctly. Learn more at [The Role of the Reorder Point](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md#the-role-of-the-reorder-point).  

Exception order proposals help ensure that the projected available inventory is never lower than the safety stock level. The proposed quantity covers the safety stock, without considering planning parameters. However, in some scenarios, order modifiers will be considered.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The planning system may have consumed the safety stock intentionally and will then replenish it straight away. Learn more at [Consume safety stock](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#consume-safety-stock).

### Attention

The attention warning is displayed in three situations:  

* The planning starting date is earlier than the work date.  
* The planning line suggests changing a released purchase or production order.  
* The projected inventory exceeds the overflow level on the due date. Learn more at [Stay below the overflow level](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md#stay-below-the-overflow-level).  

> [!NOTE]  
> In planning lines with warnings, the **Accept Action Message** field is not selected because the planner is expected to investigate the lines before carrying out the plan.  

## Error logs

On the **Calculate Plan** request page, you can select the **Stop and Show First Error** field to have the planning run stop when it encounters the first error. A message is displayed with information about the error. If an error exists, the planning worksheet will show only the planning lines that were successfully made before the error happened.  

If the field isn't selected, the **Calculate Plan** batch job will continue until it has completed. Errors won't interrupt the batch job. If there are errors, a message states how many items were affected. The **Planning Error Log** page provides more details about the error and links to the affected documents or setups.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_error_log.png" alt-text="Error messages in the planning worksheet.":::

## Planning flexibility

It isn't always practical to plan an existing supply order. For example, when production has started or you hire extra people on a specific day to do the project. To indicate whether the planning system can change an order, all supply order lines have a **Planning Flexibility** field with two options: **Unlimited** or **None**. If the field is set to **None**, the planning system won't try to change the supply order line.  

You can manually choose an option in the field, however, in some cases it'll be set automatically by [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The fact that you can manually set planning flexibility is important because it makes it easy to adapt the use of the feature to different workflows and business cases. To learn more about how this field is used, go to [Design Details: Transfers in Planning](design-details-transfers-in-planning.md).  

## Order planning

The basic supply planning tool represented by the **Order Planning** page is designed for manual decision making. It doesn't consider any planning parameters and is therefore not discussed further in this article. Learn more at [Plan for New Demand Order by Order](production-how-to-plan-for-new-demand.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> We recommend that you don't use order planning if your company already uses the planning or requisition worksheets. Supply orders created through the **Order Planning** page may be changed or deleted during the automated planning runs. These changes happen because the automated planning run uses planning parameters that you might not have considered when you manually made the plan in the Order Planning page.  

## Finite loading

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a rough-cut schedule to plan reasonable use of resources. It doesn't automatically create and maintain detailed schedules based on priorities or optimization rules.  

The intended use of the capacity-constrained resource feature is as follows:

* To avoid overloading resources
* To ensure that capacity isn't left unallocated if it could decrease the turn-around time of a production order

When planning with capacity-constrained resources, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that resources aren't loaded above their capacity (critical load). It assigns each operation to the nearest available time slot. If the time slot isn't large enough to complete the operation, it splits the operation into two or more parts in the nearest available time slots.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In case of operation splitting, the set-up time is only assigned one time because it's assumed that some manual adjustment is done to optimize the schedule.  

You can add dampener time to resources to minimize operation splitting. This time lets [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] schedule the load on the last possible day by slightly exceeding the critical load percent.

# Assembly Management

Companies can supply products to customers by combining components without using manufacturing features. Features for assembling items integrate with related features such as sales, planning, reservations, and warehousing.  

An assembly item is a sellable item that contains an assembly BOM. To learn more about assembly BOMs, go to [Work with Assembly BOMs](assembly-how-work-assembly-boms.md).

Assembly orders are internal orders, just like production orders. Use assembly orders to manage the assembly process and to connect sales requirements with warehouse activities. Assembly orders involve both output and consumption when posting. Assembly order headers are similar to output journal lines. Assembly order lines are similar to consumption journal lines.  

You can use a just-in-time inventory strategy and customize products to meet customer requests. Assembly orders can be automatically created and linked when you create a sales order line. The link between the sales demand and assembly supply opens up for several opportunities when you process sales orders:

* Customize assembly items on the fly.
* Promise delivery dates according to component availability.
* Post output and shipment of the assembled item directly from their sales orders.

To learn more about selling assembly items, go to [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

Lines on sales orders can contain items to pick from stock and items to assemble for the order. The assemble-to-order quantities take priority over inventory quantities in partial shipping. To learn more about selling stock and assembly items, go to [Combination Scenarios](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md#combination-scenarios).  

When an assemble-to-order quantity is ready to ship, a warehouse employee can post an inventory pick for the sales order lines. Posting an inventory pick does a couple of things:

* Create an inventory movement for the components
* Post the assembly output and the sales order shipment.

To learn more about assemble-to-order items and inventory picks, go to [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items with Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).

# Set Up Statuses for Service Orders and Repairs

You must set up repair status options that identify the progress of repair and maintenance of service items in service orders. You must set up at least nine repair status options that identify situations or actions taken when servicing service items.  

You can set the priority level for service order status options. The four priorities are **High**, **Medium High**, **Medium Low**, and **Low**.  

When you change the repair status of a service item in a service order, the service order status is updated. The repair status of each service item is linked to the service order status. If the service items are linked to two or more service order status options, the service order status with the highest priority is selected.  

Before you can set up a repair status, you must set up service status priorities.

## To set up service status priorities

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Order Status**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the service order status you want to set a priority for.  
3. In the **Priority** field, choose the priority you want for this service order status.  

Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you have set the priority for each of the four status options: **Pending**, **In Process**, **Finished**, and **On Hold**.  

## To set up a repair status

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Repair Status**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a new repair status.  
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
4. In the **Service Order Status** field, choose the order status to link the repair status to. The **Priority** field displays the priority of the service order status you have chosen.  
5. Choose a repair status. You can choose only one. A repair status cannot be linked more than one repair status option.  
6. To be able to post service orders, including service items, with this repair status, choose the **Posting Allowed** field.  
7. To be able to manually change the service order status option to **Pending** in service orders including service items with this repair status, choose the **Pending Status Allowed** check box.  
8. Choose the **In Process Status Allowed**, **Finished Status Allowed**, and **On Hold Status Allowed** check boxes in the same way.

Repeat these steps for each of the repair status options you want to create.

# Work with inventory periods

Inventory periods define a period of time in which you can post changes to inventory. An inventory period is defined by the date on which it ends, or the ending date. When you close an inventory period, you can't post any changes to inventory, either expected or invoiced, before this ending date. You can't post any new values to inventory before the ending date. If you have open item entries in the closed period, meaning positive quantities that haven't yet been applied to outbound transactions, you can still apply outbound quantities to these entries, even if the period is closed.  

The following sections describe how to:

* Create inventory periods.  
* Close inventory periods.  
* Reopen inventory periods.  

## To create an inventory period

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new line.  
3. In the **Ending Date** field, enter the last date in the inventory period that you want to define. When the period is closed, you won't be able to post inventory changes before this date.  
4. Enter a descriptive name in the **Name** field. Choose the **OK** button.  

## To close inventory periods

The **Closed** field indicates whether or not the inventory period is closed to inventory value changes. You can't edit this field.  

You can close any inventory period, if the following is true:  

* There are no open outbound item ledger entries, meaning negative inventory, in that period.  
* The cost of all items has been adjusted using the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job.  

This means that all outbound transaction quantities, such as those from sales orders, outbound transfers, sales invoices, purchase returns, or purchase credit memos, must be applied to existing quantity in inventory.  

### To close an inventory period  

1. Before closing an inventory period, choose the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** action to ensure that all cost adjustments are posted.

    Run the **Close Inventory Period – Test** report to determine if there are any open outbound item entries within the inventory period or any items whose cost hasn't yet been adjusted.  
2. Choose the **Test Report** action.  

    Run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job to ensure that all costs are posted to the general ledger.  
3. Choose the **Post Inventory to G/L** action.  
4. On the **Inventory Periods** page, select the inventory period you want to close.  
5. Choose the **Close Period** action. After the inventory period has been closed, you can't post inventory changes before the ending date. The cost of all items must be adjusted with the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job before you close the inventory period.  
6. Choose the **Yes** button to confirm that you want to close the period, or choose **No** to cancel the closing.  
7. The inventory period is closed and a confirmation message is displayed when it's finished.  

## Reopening inventory periods  
After you have closed the inventory period, you can't delete the inventory period. You can, however, reopen it, if you would like to allow posting before the ending date of the inventory period. Reopening a period also reopens all inventory periods with ending dates later than the period you reopen.  

### To reopen an inventory period  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the inventory period you want to reopen.  
3. Choose the **Reopen Period** period action. Confirm that you want to reopen the period.  
4. All inventory periods with ending dates later than the period you selected are reopened.

# Default data for sustainability

To simplify how you manage your sustainability accounts and emissions, you can create default values for the following entities:  

- **G/L Account** (only available default sustainability account)
- **Item** (available default sustainability account and emissions)
- **Resource** (available default sustainability account and emissions)
- **Work Center** (available default sustainability account and emissions)
- **Machine Center** (available default sustainability account and emissions)

> [!NOTE]
> Although you set default values, you can change them on journals and documents as needed. These values are simply defaults and aren't mandatory.  

## G/L accounts

To set up a default sustainability account for a G/L account, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of accounts**, and then select the related link.
2. In the **No.** field, choose the number for the account you want to configure to open the **G/L Account Card** page.  
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account you want to use as the default.
4. Close the page.

## Items

For items, you can use the manually entered sustainability account, or use the default value you have on the **Item Category**. The following processes explain both options.

### Specify a default sustainability account for an item category

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item categories**, and then select the related link.
2. In the **Code** field, choose the code for the category you want to configure to open the **Item Category Card** page.  
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account you want to use as the default for the category.
4. Close the page.

### Specify default sustainability values for an item  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the card for an item for which you want to set up default values.  
3. Add the default sustainability account:

   1. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account you want to use as the default.  
   2. If you configured default sustainability accounts on item categories, select the **Item Category Code** you want to use on the **Item** FastTab. The default value for the category updates the value in **Default Sust. Account** field.

4. Fill in the following fields for default emissions for this item:

   1. **Default CO2 Emission**
   2. **Default CH4 Emission**  
   3. **Default N2O Emission**

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can add default emissions only if the **Replenishment System** is set to **Purchase**. For other options, you can only set up the **Default Sust. Account**. CO2e (carbon equivalent) is calculated based on your production or assembly processes. If you already filled in the emissions fields and then change the replenishment system to something other than **Purchase**, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] deletes the existing emissions.

5. Run the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate **CO2e per Unit** field if you're just setting up this item and you don't have earlier transactions. By default, this action updates this item only. However, you can change the filter and apply it to a different range of items.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > The calculation of CO2e (carbon equivalent) is based on the default emissions you specified for the item and your setup on the **Emission Fees** page.  

6. Close the page.

> [!NOTE]
> The information you enter for emissions and the calculated **CO2e per Unit** are overridden by the system's calculations for this item based on **Sustainability Value Entry**. This data comes from the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, and uses the average method of emission calculation. Therefore, manually calculated **CO2e per Unit** is only used before posting documents with the correct values. This means you can use manual creation for data planning (**Production BOM**, **Assembly Order**, and so on) before you post the related document.  

## Resources

To set up default sustainability values for a resource, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **resources**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the card for a resource for which you want to set up default values.
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account to use as the default.  
4. Fill in the following fields for default emissions for the resource:

   1. **Default CO2 Emission**
   2. **Default CH4 Emission**  
   3. **Default N2O Emission**

5. Run the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate the value in the **CO2e per Unit** field.

> [!NOTE]
> You must use the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate the **CO2e per Unit** field because, unlike items, no other transactions affect these values. By default, this action updates this resource only. However, you can change the filter and apply it to a different range of resources.  

> [!NOTE]
> The calculation of CO2e (carbon equivalent) is based on the default emissions you specified for the resource and your setup on the **Emission Fees** page.  

6. Close the page.

## Work centers

To set up default sustainability values for a work center, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work centers**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the **Work Center Card** page for a work center for which you want to set up default values.  
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account to use as the default.  
4. Fill in the following fields for default emissions for this work center:

   1. **Default CO2 Emission**
   2. **Default CH4 Emission**  
   3. **Default N2O Emission**

5. Run the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate the value in the **CO2e per Unit** field.

> [!NOTE]
> You must use the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate the **CO2e per Unit** field because, unlike items, no other transactions affect these values. By default, this action updates this work center only. However, you can change the filter and apply it to a different range of work centers.  

> [!NOTE]
> The calculation of CO2e (carbon equivalent) is based on the default emissions you specified for this work center and your setup on the **Emission Fees** page.  

7. Close the page.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also run the **Calculate CO2e** action from the **Work Centers** list page. You can also apply this action to machine centers.  

## Machine centers

To set up default sustainability values for a machine center, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Machine centers**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the **Machine Center Card** for a machine center for which you want to set up default values.  
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account to use as the default.  
4. Fill in the following fields for default emissions for this machine center:

   1. **Default CO2 Emission**
   2. **Default CH4 Emission**  
   3. **Default N2O Emission**

5. Run the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate **CO2e per Unit** field.

> [!NOTE]
> You must use the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate the **CO2e per Unit** field because, unlike items, no other transactions affect these values. By default, this action updates this machine center only. However, you can change the filter and apply it to a different range of machine centers.  

> [!NOTE]
> The calculation of CO2e (carbon equivalent) is based on the default emissions you specified for this machine center and your setup on the **Emission Fees** page.  

6. Close the page.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also run the **Calculate CO2e** action from the **Machine Centers** list page. You can also apply this action to work centers.

# Design details: table structure

To understand how dimension entries are stored and posted, it's important to understand the table structure.  

## Table 480, Dimension Set Entry  

You can't change this table. After data is written to the table, you can't delete or edit it.

|Field No.|Field Name|Data Type|Comment|  
|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|  
|1|**ID**|Integer|>0.0 is reserved for the empty dimension set. References field 3 in table 481.|  
|2|**Dimension Code**|Code 20|Table relation to table 348.|  
|3|**Dimension Value Code**|Code 20|Table relation to table 349.|  
|4|**Dimension Value ID**|Integer|References field 12 in table 349. It's the secondary key that is used when traversing table 481.|  
|5|**Dimension Name**|Text 30|CalcField. Lookup to table 348.|  
|6|**Dimension Value Name**|Text 30|CalcField. Lookup to table 349.|  

## Table 481, Dimension Set Tree Node  
You can't change this table. It's used to search for a dimension set. If the dimension set isn't found, a new set is created.  

|Field No.|Field Name|Data Type|Comment|  
|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|  
|1|**Parent Dimension Set ID**|Integer|0 for top level node.|  
|2|**Dimension Value ID**|Integer|Table relation to field 12 in table 349.|  
|3|**Dimension Set ID**|Integer|AutoIncrement. Used in field 1 in table 480.|  
|4|**In Use**|Boolean|False if not in use.|  

## Table 482 Reclas. Dimension Set Buffer  
This table is used when you change a dimension value code, for example, on an item ledger entry by using the **Item Reclassification Journal** page.  

|Field No.|Field Name|Data Type|Comment|  
|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|  
|1|**Dimension Code**|Code 20|Table relation to table 348.|  
|2|**Dimension Value Code**|Code 20|Table relation to table 349.|  
|3|**Dimension Value ID**|Integer|References field 12 in table 349.|  
|4|**New Dimension Value Code**|Code 20|Table relation to table 349.|  
|5|**New Dimension Value ID**|Integer|References field 12 in table 349.|  
|6|**Dimension Name**|Text 30|CalcField. Lookup to table 348.|  
|7|**Dimension Value Name**|Text 30|CalcField. Lookup to table 349.|  
|8|**New Dimension Value Name**|Text 30|CalcField. Lookup to table 349.|  

## Transaction and Budget Tables  
In addition to other dimension fields in the table, this field is important:  

|Field No.|Field Name|Data Type|Comment|  
|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|  
|480|**Dimension Set ID**|Integer|References field 1 in table 480.|  

### Table 83, Item Journal Line  
In addition to other dimension fields in the table, these fields are important.  

|Field No.|Field Name|Data Type|Comment|  
|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|  
|480|**Dimension Set ID**|Integer|References field 1 in table 480.|  
|481|**New Dimension Set ID**|Integer|References field 1 in table 480.|  

### Table 349, Dimension Value  
In addition to other dimension fields in the table, these fields are important.  

|Field No.|Field Name|Data Type|Comment|  
|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|  
|12|**Dimension Value ID**|Integer|AutoIncrement. Used for references in table 480 and table 481.|  

### Tables That Contain the Dimension Set ID Field
 The **Dimension Set ID** field (480) exists in the following tables. For the tables that store posted data, the field only provides a noneditable display of dimensions, which is marked as Drill-down. For the tables that store working documents, the field is editable. The buffer tables that are used internally don't need editable or noneditable capabilities.  

 Field 480 is noneditable in the following tables.

# Work with blanket sales orders or blanket purchase orders

A blanket sales order represents a framework for a long-term agreement between you and your customer. Similarly, you use blanket purchase orders to manage long-term agreements between you and your vendor.

A blanket order is typically made when a customer has committed to purchasing large quantities that are to be delivered in several smaller shipments over a certain period of time. Often blanket orders cover only one item with predetermined delivery dates. The main reason for using a blanket order rather than a sales order is that quantities entered on a blanket order don't affect item availability and thus can be used as a worksheet for monitoring, forecasting, and planning purposes.

On the blanket order, each separate shipment can be set up as an order line, which can then be converted into a sales order at the time of shipping.

An example of when a blanket sales order could be used is if a customer calls and places an order of 1000 units of an item and they want the items to be delivered in 250 units every week over the next month.

> [!NOTE]
> Blanket purchase orders work in a similar way as blanket sales orders. This documentation covers blanket sales orders only.

## To create a blanket sales order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Blanket Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Leave the **Order Date** field blank. When the separate sales orders are created from the blanket order, the order date of the sales order is set to equal the actual work date.
5. On the **Lines** FastTab, create separate lines for each shipment. For instance, if your customer wants 1000 units split out equally between four weeks, you would enter four separate lines of 250 units each.  

## To create a sales order from a blanket sales order  

1. To create an order for any of the lines in the blanket sales order, remove the quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field on all the lines that you don't wish to ship at this time.  
2. When you're ready to create orders, choose the **Make Order** action, and then choose **Yes**. A message appears informing you that the blanket order has been assigned an order number. Note that the blanket order hasn't been deleted.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  
4. To see the results of the preceding steps, choose the **Line** action, choose the **Unposted Lines** action, and then choose the **Orders** action.  
5. On the **Sales Lines** page, select the appropriate sales order, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Show Document** action.  

The following applies to sales orders after they have been created from blanket sales orders:  

- After the blanket order is converted into a sales order, the sales order contains all the lines from the blanket order. The lines where the quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field was deleted appear, but with blank **Quantity** fields. You may choose to leave, edit, or delete the lines.  
- It's important to remember that the sales order line quantity must not exceed the quantity of the associated blanket order line. Otherwise, posting of the sales order won't be possible.  
- When the sales order is posted as shipped and/or invoiced, the **Quantity Shipped** and **Quantity Invoiced** fields are updated on the related blanket order.  
- The blanket order number and line number are recorded as properties of the sales lines when created from a blanket order.  
- When sales orders aren't created directly from the blanket order but still relate to it, a link between a sales order and a blanket order can be established by entering the associated blanket order number in the **Blanket Order No.** field on the sales order line.  
- After the sales order has been created for the total quantity of a blanket order line, no other sales order can be created for the same line. Users are prevented from entering a quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field. If, however, additional quantities need to be added to a blanket order, the value in the **Quantity** field can be increased and additional orders can then be created.  
- The invoiced blanket sales order remains in the system until it's deleted, either by deleting individual blanket orders or by running the **Delete Invoiced Blanket Sales Orders** batch job.  
- If a customer is also recorded as a contact in the Marketing application area, and if you have specified an interaction template code for blanket sales order on the **Marketing Setup** page, an interaction is recorded in the Interaction Log Entry table when you select **Print** to print the blanket sales order.

## To view the status of a blanket sales order

You can see the status of a blanket sales order on the **Sales Blanket Order Statistics** page. This might be relevant when you start to invoice the order that is created from the blanket sales order.  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Blanket Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select a blanket sales order, and then choose the **Statistics** action.  
3.  On the **Sales Blanket Order Statistics** page, on the **General** FastTab, you can see summary information about the entire order based on the total quantity in the various **Quantity fields** on the blanket sales order lines.  

- On the **Invoicing** FastTab, you can see summary information based on the total quantity in the **Qty. to Invoice** fields on the sales blanket order lines.  
- On the **Shipping** FastTab, you can see summary information based on the total quantity in the **Qty. to Receive** fields on the sales blanket order lines.  
- On the **Prepayment** FastTab, you can see summary information about any prepaid amounts.  
- On the **Vendor** FastTab, you can see certain basic information about the vendor.

# Work with Manufacturing Batch Units of Measure
If an item is stocked in one unit of measure but produced in another, a production order is created that uses a manufacturing batch unit of measure to calculate the correct quantity of the components during the **Refresh Production Order** batch job. An example of a manufacturing batch unit of measure calculation is when a manufactured item is stocked in pieces but produced in tons.  

## To create a production BOM using a batch unit of measure  
1.  The manufacturing batch unit of measure is set up as an alternative unit of measure on the **Item Units of Measure** page on the item to be produced. The batch unit of measure will not replace the base unit of measure on the item.  
2.  Create a production BOM for the item set up with the manufacturing batch unit of measure. For more information, see [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).  
3.  In the **Unit of Measure Code** field, select the manufacturing batch unit of measure.  
4.  For each production BOM line, in the **Quantity Per** field, enter the quantity of this component item that is required to create this batch unit of measure.  
5.  Open the **Item Card** for the related item.  

    On the **Replenishment** FastTab, in the **Production BOM No.** field, select the production BOM created above.  
6.  Create a production order header using the item set up with the manufacturing batch unit of measure. For more information, see [Create Production Orders](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md).  
7.  Choose the **Refresh** action, and then choose  the **OK** button.  

On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Components** action to view the result. The application calculates the correct quantity of the components needed to satisfy the production BOM based on the manufacturing batch unit of measure.  

## To calculate a manufacturing batch unit of measure on a production order  
1.  Create a production order header using the item set up with the manufacturing batch unit of measure.  
2.  In the **Item No.** field in the Production Order line, type the same item number used in the header.  
3.  In the **Quantity** field, enter the same quantity used in the header.  
4.  In the **Unit of Measure Code** field, select the manufacturing batch unit of measure code.  
5.  Choose the **Refresh** action.
6.  On the **Calculate** FastTab, clear the **Lines** check box.  
7.  Choose the **OK** button.  
8.  On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Components** action to view the result. The correct quantity of the components needed to satisfy the production BOM is calculated based on the manufacturing batch unit of measure.

# Manage user settings and preferences

As an administrator, you can configure user settings in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], similar to how individual users can manage their own preferences in the **My Settings** page.  

Get an overview of all users in the **Users** list, and change individual settings by selecting the **User Settings** action for the relevant user.

> [!TIP]
> The **User Settings** list shows the current settings for each user. To view or edit individual users, select the **View** or **Edit** action.

The **User Settings** card page is similar to the **My Settings** page that each user has access to, and it's a powerful tool for you as the administrator for setting default settings and clearing personalized pages, for example.  

## Types of user settings

*User settings* isn't the same as *user setup*, which is about the user as an entity and the user's access in the system. Furthermore, the user settings have nothing to do with a user's personalization, such as lightweight changes to the user interface. User settings determine the predefined settings for each user in various aspects of the way the application presents itself to the user. The following paragraph lists the five types of user settings and preferences that can be set by the individual or centrally by the administrator:

* **Company**  

  This setting determines the company to be logged into at the next sign-in. A user can have access to multiple companies and can be active in several companies.

* **Role**  

  The role, or profile, describes the user's function in the company, such as *Sales Manager*, *Bookkeeper*, or *Purchasing Agent*. The profile then determines the user's role center, the home page that users experience when they sign in. The profile doesn't impact access rights to functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

* **Language**  

  Defines the application language that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] presents text, captions, and error messages in. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users are synchronized from Microsoft 365, the language settings from Microsoft 365 are used, assuming that the user wants to use the same settings in Office products and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The administrator can change the default setting, and each user can choose between available languages in the My Settings page. But they'll be reset to the value from Microsoft 365 once the next synchronization is performed.

  If the language setting from Microsoft 365 matches a supported language in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], this language is chosen for the user.  

  > [!NOTE]
  > You may have to install a language app for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to properly display the language. Therefore, it's a good practice to install the necessary language apps before any user logs in the first time so that they have a good experience from their first day. For more information, see the list of [supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations).  
  
* **Region**  

  Defines how dates and numbers are presented in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client, such as whether to use European or American date formats, or how to display the decimal sign and thousand separators in amounts. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users are synchronized from Microsoft 365, the regional settings from Microsoft 365 are used, assuming that the user wants to use the same settings in Office products and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. An administrator or user can change these settings manually in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], but they'll be reset to the value from Microsoft 365 once the next synchronization is performed.

* **Time zone**  

  Defines the time zone in which the user is located. Currently this setting isn't synchronized from Microsoft 365 and must be set manually.  

* **Teaching tips**

  [!INCLUDE [ua-teachingtips](includes/ua-teachingtips.md)] As an administrator, you can switch off teaching tips for all users, such as if you are in process of onboarding users who are already familiar with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

> [!NOTE]
> If a Microsoft 365 user synchronization is made while users are logged into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], these users must refresh the browser or sign out and back in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to see a potential different language set by the synchronization action.

## Overview of all user-specific changes

As the administrator, you can get an overview of individual changes to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that each user might have made to various pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. As users make changes to their experience in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], these changes are reflected in the **Personalized Pages** list. <!--Administrators can also set these settings for users before they log in the first time, so users do not have to do it themselves, providing them a better *getting started* experience.-->

<!-- >[!NOTE]
> User personalizations do not have anything to do with the *personal* lightweight changes a user can make to the user experience.-->

## Review or delete user personalizations

1. Select the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Personalized Pages**, and then select the related link.
2. This shows the list of users and their personalized pages. To clear a user's personalization, click the relevant row, or select **Manage**, and then select **Delete**.

This task deletes the personalization, and the user's experience of the relevant page returns to the default state.

# Sustainability value chain in production

The requirement for enabling the sustainability value chain in manufacturing processes is to enable the **Enable Value Chain tracking**, **Item Emissions**, and **Work/Machine Center Emissions** fields on the **Sustainability Setup** page.  

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Check whether the basic setup already exists. If it doesn't, follow [these instructions](finance-sustainability-setup.md) to set it up.  
3. On the **Procurement** FastTab, fill in the following fields:
   1. **Enable Value Chain tracking** to enable sustainability value entry posting through value chain operations and the visibility of these fields on operational documents and journals.
   2. **Item Emissions** to enable a default sustainability account and emissions on the **Item Card** page.  
   3. **Work/Machine Center Emissions** to enable default sustainability accounts and emissions on the **Work Center** and **Machine Center** pages.  
4. Close the page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because the sustainability value chain works only with the carbon equivalent (CO2e), before you start, configure the **Carbon Equivalent Factors** on the **Emission Fees** page. To learn more, go to [Emission fees](value-chain-howto-setup.md#emission-fees).  

## Working with a production BOM

To learn more about how to work with the **Production BOM**, go to [How to create a production BOM](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md). This article only covers the effect of CO2e emissions on production BOMs.  

If you set up default emissions for items you plan to use on production BOM lines, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically fills in the **CO2e per Unit** field for each line when you create a new production BOM. However, if you created a production BOM before you configured emissions for items, or if you updated the emission values for items, you can run the **Calculate CO2e** action. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates all **CO2e per Unit** values using the latest emission details from the items. You can even run the **Calculate CO2e** action from the **Production BOMs** page to update all production BOMs with the latest emissions.

## Working with routings

To learn more about how to work with routes, go to [How to create a route with production operations](production-how-to-create-routings.md). This article only explains the effect of CO2e emissions on routes.

If you set up default emissions for work or machine centers you plan to use in the **Routing** lines, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically fills in the **CO2e per Unit** field for each line when you create a new routing. However, if you created a routing before you configured emissions for work or machine centers, or if you updated the emission values for them, you can run the **Calculate CO2e** action. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates all **CO2e per Unit** values using the latest emission details from the work or machine centers.

## Working with production orders  

To learn more about how to work with production orders, go to [About production orders](production-about-production-orders.md) and [How to create production orders](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md). However, the connection of production orders with the sustainability value chain is:

- Tracking the emissions for items and work or machine centers consumed during the production process.
- Transferring the total emission values to the produced items or finished goods.  

To use a production order in the sustainability value chain process, add CO2e (carbon equivalent) emissions in all posted entries through the journals you use in the production process. You can start the process using a **Released Production Order**. To use the sustainability value chain in production orders, all items (raw materials) and work or machine centers you want to use must have a **Sustainability Account No.** and emissions.  

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Released production orders**, and then select the related link.
2. Create a new production order. To learn more about production orders, go to [How to create a production order](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md).
3. Run the **Refresh Production Order** action to calculate values for the line.  
4. After you refresh the order, the value in the **Total CO2e** field updates based on emissions in the production BOM and routing for the production items.

When you refresh the production order, values from the production BOM and routing transfer to the **Prod. Order Components** and **Prod. Order Routing** pages for the production order you're using. If you change the initial production BOM and routing, it doesn't affect the production order you refreshed previously.  

To check the emission values, run the **Routing** or **Components** actions from the production order lines.  

> [!NOTE]
> Although the **Total CO2e** emission amount displays for each line on the **Prod. Order Components** and **Prod. Order Routing** pages, there's a field called **CO2e per Unit**. Its value comes from the **Item**, **Work Center** or **Machine Center** pages, and is used for calculations. However, if you change the value in the **Total CO2e** field on the line, the **CO2e per Unit** recalculates based on the total emission and quantity for that line.  

### Posting transactions related to production order  

To post all transactions related to the production order and record the emissions, choose one of the following journals:  

- Production journals
- Consumption journals
- Output journals

#### Production journals  

Production journals combine the functions of the separate consumption journal and output journals into one journal. The combined journal is accessed directly from a released production order. To learn more, go to [How to register consumption and output for a released production order line](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md). Related to emissions, be sure that all lines have a value in the **CO2e per Unit** field.

Every time you post the journal, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates sustainability value entries. You can access these entries from the **Release Production Order** page by running the **Sustainability Value Entries** action.  

#### Consumption journals

To learn more about consumption journals, go to [Batch post production consumption](production-how-to-post-consumption.md). It's important to know that all emissions are updated by posting these journals for all consumption transactions. When you post a journal, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates sustainability value entries with the **Consumption** option as the **Item Ledger Entry Type**.  

#### Output journals

To learn more about output journals, go to [Batch post output and run times](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md). It's important to know that all emissions are updated by posting these journals for all output transactions based on the routings. When you post the journal, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates sustainability value entries with the **Output** option as the **Item Ledger Entry Type** for the finished good production. It also creates transactions for the work or machine centers you used related to the capacity ledger entry.  

### Finish a production order

When you finish a production order, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the value of your produced item and the **CO2e per Unit** field on the **Item Card** page for it.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the value in the **CO2e per Unit** field for the produced item by summing the total emissions from all consumed items and operations (work and machine centers), and then divide that by the total output quantity.

# Walkthrough: Set up and invoicing sales prepayments

This walkthrough takes you through the process of setting up and using prepayments in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. [!INCLUDE [prepayment_def](includes/prepayment_def.md)]

[!INCLUDE [prepayment_req](includes/prepayment_req.md)]

For example, you can send more prepayment invoices if more items are added to the order.  

## About this walkthrough  

This walkthrough will take you through the following scenarios:  

- Setting up prepayments  
- Creating an order that requires a prepayment  
- Creating a prepayment invoice  
- Correcting the prepayment requirements on an order  
- Applying prepayments to an order  
- Invoicing the final amount on an order with prepayment  

### Roles

This walkthrough includes tasks for the following roles:  

- Accounting Manager (Phyllis)  
- Order Processor (Susan)  
- Accounts Receivable Administrator (Arnie)  

## Story

 Phyllis is an accounting manager and makes decisions about which customers are required to pay a deposit before items are manufactured or shipped. Phyllis sets up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to calculate prepayments automatically.  

 Susan is a sales order processor. When a customer calls to place an order, Susan enters the order into the system while the customer is on the telephone. This way, Susan can verify prices and payment terms with the customer immediately, and make changes to the order while negotiating with the customer.  

 Arnie works in the Accounts Receivable department and posts invoices and payments.  

 In this scenario, Phyllis sets up prepayment requirements for the customer Selangorian based on their credit history. Phyllis gives Susan instructions for how to handle their orders.  

 When the customer calls, Susan negotiates with the customer until they reach an agreement, and then chooses to calculate the prepayment in several different ways.  

 After Susan sends the prepayment invoice, the customer orders an extra item. Susan updates the order and creates a second prepayment invoice.  

 Arnie registers the customer's payment and applies it to the invoices, and then sends the final invoice.  

## Set up prepayments

Phyllis sets up the system to handle prepayments for customers.  

- Phyllis decides to have the same number series for prepayments as the one used for sales invoicing.  
- Phyllis sets application to check if prepayments are required before final invoicing on an order.  
- Phyllis sets up default values for a required prepayment percentage for particular items and customers.  

The following procedures describe how to complete Phyllis' tasks:  

### To set up number series for prepayments

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, expand the **Number Series** FastTab.  
3. Verify that the number series for posted prepayment invoices in the **Posted Prepmt. Inv. Nos.** field is the same as for posted sales invoices (**Posted Invoice Nos.**), and the number series for posted prepayment credit memos (**Posted Prepmt. Cr. Memo Nos.**) is the same as for posted credit memos (**Posted Credit Memo Nos.**).  

### To block shipments for unpaid prepayment

1. On the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, on the **General** FastTab, select the **Check Prepayment when Posting** check box.

Now you can't ship or invoice an order that has an unpaid prepayment amount.  

By default, Phyllis requires customer 20000 to be invoiced for a 30% down payment on all orders. Therefore, Phyllis will enter a default prepayment percentage on the customer card.  

Phyllis requires all customers to be invoiced a 20% deposit for item 1896-S. Customer 20000 has a poor payment history, so Phyllis requires a 40% prepayment from customer 20000 for item 1896-S. The following procedure illustrates how to set up default prepayment percentages.  

### To assign default prepayment percentages to customers and items

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the card for customer 20000 (Trey Research).
3. On the **Payments** FastTab, in the **Prepayment %** field, enter **30**.  
4. Choose the **Related** action, select the **Sales** menu item, and then choose the **Prepayment Percentages** menu item.  
5. Fill in two lines on the **Sales Prepayment Percentages** page as follows.  

    |**Sales Type**|**Sales Code**|**Item No.**|**Prepayment %**|  
    |--------------------|--------------------|------------------|----------------------|  
    |**Customer**|**20000**|**1896-S**|**40**|
    |**Customer**|**20000**|**1900-S**|**30**|  
    
    > [!TIP]
    > Depending on your country/region, you must also specify a tax group code on the **Costs & Posting** FastTab for item 1896-S. When you use the demonstration company, this field is already set.

6. Close all pages.  

### To specify an account for sales prepayments in general posting setup

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the line where the **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** field is set to **DOMESTIC**, and the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** field is set to **RETAIL**.  
3. In the **Sales Prepayments Account** field, specify the relevant account. Your selection is automatically saved.  

> [!TIP]
> If you cannot see the field in the **General Posting Setup** page, then use the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the page to scroll to the right.  

## Create an order that requires a prepayment

 In the following scenario, Susan, the order processor, creates an order when talking to a customer. The items the customer is ordering require a prepayment. Plus, the customer has made some late payments in the past. Susan's been instructed to require a fixed amount of **800** as a prepayment on the order.  

The customer asks to pay 35%, to which Susan agrees and changes the order.  

Susan creates the prepayment invoice and sends it to the customer.  

### To create a sales order with a prepayment

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Customer Name** field, choose **Trey Research**.  
4. Close the overdue balance warning that is displayed.  
5. Fill in two sales lines with the following information.  

    |**Type**|**No.**|**Quantity**|  
    |--------------|-------------|------------------|  
    |**Item**|**1896-S**|**1**|  
    |**Item**|**1900-S**|**1**|

    By default, the prepayment fields on the sales line are hidden. To display the fields, you must personalize the page. For more information, see [To start personalizing a page through the Personalizing banner](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

6. Verify that the **Prepayment %** field on the line with item **1900-S** contains **30**. The default value was taken from the sales header, which was populated from the customer card.  

    The **Prepayment %** field on the line with item **1896-S** contains **40**. 40 is the percentage you entered on the **Sales Prepayment Percentages** page for item **1896-S** and customer **20000**.  

    For more information, see [Set Up Prepayments](finance-set-up-prepayments.md).  
7. In the **Order** action, choose  **Statistics**.  
8. On the **Prepayment** FastTab, the **Prepayment Amount Excl. VAT** field contains **458.16**. If you create a prepayment invoice for the order now, 458.16 is the amount on the invoice.  

    In this scenario, Susan has been instructed to suggest a total prepayment of **800** for the order.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  Depending on your country/region, the following step might not apply.  
9. Change the amount in the **Prepmt. Amount Excl. Tax** field to **800** and then close the page.  
10. Verify the **Prepayment %** field on the sales lines, and you'll see that it has been recalculated to **67.02438** and **67.02282**.  

     The recalculation includes all lines that have a prepayment percentage that is greater than 0.  

     Now the customer asks if the prepayment percent can be set to 35%. Susan's supervisor approves the change.
11. On the **Sales Order** page, on the **Prepayment** FastTab in the **Prepayment %** field, enter **35**.  
12. In the warning that appears, choose the **Yes** button. A rate of 35% will be applied as the payment percentage for the whole order.  
13. Verify that the lines have been updated correctly.  

## Create a prepayment invoice

After entering the correct prepayment values on the order, Susan creates the prepayment invoice and sends it to the customer.  

### To create a prepayment invoice

1. On the **Sales Order** page, choose **Actions**, then **Posting**, then **Prepayment** and then select **Post and Print Prepmt. Invoice**
2. Choose the **Yes** button to post the invoice.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Susan would now send the invoice to the customer.  

## Create an additional prepayment invoice

The following day, the customer calls Susan and makes changes to the order. The customer wants two of item 1896-S. Susan reopens the order, updates it, and then creates a second prepayment invoice for the order and sends it to the customer.  

### To create an additional prepayment invoice

1. On the **Sales Order** page, choose the **Release** action, and then **Reopen**.  
2. On the line for item **1896-S**, in the **Quantity** field, enter **2**.  

    In the **Order** action, choose **Statistics**. The **Prepayment Amount Excl. VAT** field now contains **768.04**, and the **Prepmt. Amt. Invoiced Excl. VAT** field contains **417.76**. These values show that there's an extra prepayment amount that hasn't been invoiced yet.  
3. To post an invoice for the extra prepayment amount, choose **Actions**, then **Posting**, then **Prepayment** and then select **Post and Print Prepmt. Invoice**
4. Choose the **Yes** button to post the invoice.  

## Apply the prepayments

The customer pays the prepayment amount. Arnie, from the accounting department, registers the payment, and applies it to the prepayment invoices.  

### To apply a payment to the prepayment invoices

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Receipt Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in a journal line with the following information.  

    |Field name|Enter|  
    |----------------|-----------|  
    |**Document Type**|**Payment**|  
    |**Account Type**|**Customer**|  
    |**Account No.**|**20000**|  
3. Choose the **Process** action, and then **Apply Entries**.  
4. On the **Apply Customer Entries** page, select the first prepayment invoice, and then choose the **Process** action, and then choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action.  
5. Repeat the previous step for the second prepayment.  
6. Choose the **OK** button.  

    The **Amount** fields have now been filled in with the sum of the two prepayment invoices.  

7. To post the journal, choose the **Post/Print** action, then select **Post**.
8. Choose the **Yes** button.

## Invoice the remaining amount

Now Arnie has been informed that the items on the order have been shipped and that the order is ready for invoicing. Arnie creates the invoice for the order.  

### To invoice the remaining amount

1. Open the sales order.
2. Choose the **Posting** action, then **Post**.
3. Select **Ship and Invoice**, and then choose the **OK** button.
4. If you want to preview the invoice, choose the **Yes** button.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Normally, the shipping department would have already posted the shipment.  

    Arnie can view the history to verify that the sales invoice was created as intended.

5. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  

## Update the status of prepaid orders and invoices automatically

You can speed up order and invoice processing by setting up job queue entries that automatically update the status of those documents. When a prepayment invoice is paid, the job queue entries can automatically change the document status from **Pending Prepayment** to **Released**. When you set up the job queue entries, the codeunits you'll need to use are **383 Upd. Pending Prepmt. Sales** and **383 Upd. Pending Prepmt. Purchase**. We recommend that you schedule the entries to run frequently, for example, every minute. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## Next steps

This walkthrough covered the following steps to set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to handle prepayments. 

- Set up default prepayment percentages on customers and items.
- Use different methods to calculate the prepayments on an order.  
- Calculate the prepayment amount as a percentage of the total on the order.
- Assign one total prepayment amount to the order.  

You've also posted a prepayment invoice, created a second prepayment invoice when the order has changed, and posted the final invoice for the remaining amount.  

The prepayments capabilities make it easy to set up and enforce prepayment rules for customers and items. They also let you to post every payment against an invoice.

# Viewing Database Locks

Database locking controls access by multiple users to the same data at the same time. To protect a transaction against other transactions modifying the same data, the first transaction puts a lock on the data. The lock remains until the transaction's done.

Users may be blocked from completing transactions on the locked data. They'll typically get a message that indicates the lock condition.

## To view database locks

Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Database Locks**, and then choose the related link.

The **Database Locks** page gives snapshot of all current database locks.

For more information about database locking, see [Monitoring Database Locks](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/monitor-database-locks) in the Business Central Developer and IT Pro help.

# Work with dimensions

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from.  

So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department and project, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts. Learn more at [Business Intelligence](bi.md).

Another example is to set up a dimension called *Department*, then use that dimension when you post sales documents. This way, you can use business intelligence tools to see which department sold which items. The more dimensions you use, the more detailed are the reports you base your business decisions on. In fact, a single sales entry can include information from multiple dimensions, such as:  

* The account the item sale was posted to.  
* Where the item was sold.
* Who sold it.
* Which customer bought it.

## Analyze by dimensions

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence, such as when defining analysis views. Learn more at [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

> [!TIP]
> A quick way to analyze transactional data by dimensions is to use the **Set Dimension Filter** action to filter totals by dimensions in the chart of accounts and on pages for entries.

> [!NOTE]
> Analysis views often use data from dimensions. If you discover an incorrect dimension has been used on posted general ledger (G/L) entries, you can correct the dimension values and update your analysis views. This helps keep your financial reports and analyses accurate. Learn more at [Troubleshooting and Correcting Dimensions](finance-troubleshooting-correcting-dimensions.md#changing-dimension-assignments-after-posting).

## Dimension sets

A dimension set is a unique combination of dimension values. They're stored as dimension set entries in the database. Each dimension set entry represents a single dimension value. In addition, each dimension set, and dimension set entry within it, is identified by a common dimension set ID.  

When you create a journal line, document header, or document line, you can specify a combination of dimension values. Instead of explicitly storing each dimension value in the database, a dimension set ID is assigned to the journal line, document header, or document line to specify the dimension set.  

## Set up dimensions

You can define dimensions and dimension values to categorize journals and documents, such as sales orders and purchase orders. You set up dimensions on the **Dimensions** page, where you create one line for each dimension, such as *Project*, *Department*, *Area*, and *Salesperson*.

You also set up values for dimensions. Let's say values represent your company's departments. Dimension values can be set up in a hierarchical structure similar to the chart of accounts. That means data can be broken down into various levels of granularity, and subsets of dimension values can be totaled. You can define as many dimensions and dimension values as you need, and everyone in your company can use them.

When dimensions and values are set up, you can define global and shortcut dimensions on the **General Ledger Setup** page. These dimensions are then always available for you to select as fields on journal and document lines, and ledger entries, without opening the **Dimensions** page first. Learn more in the [To set up global and shortcut dimensions](finance-dimensions.md#to-set-up-global-and-shortcut-dimensions) section.

* **Global Dimensions** are used as filters, for example, on reports, batch jobs, and XMLports. You can use only two global dimensions, so choose dimensions you'll use often.
* **Shortcut Dimensions** are available as fields on journals, document lines, and ledger entries. You can create up to eight of these.  

> [!NOTE]
> After you use a new dimension in any entry, such as a line or new record, you cannot delete the dimension, even if you do not post the entry. This is because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] immediately creates a dimension set for the line or record. Learn more in the [Dimension Sets](finance-dimensions.md#dimension-sets) section.

### To set up default dimensions for customers, vendors, and other accounts

You can assign a default dimension for a specific account. The dimension is copied to the journal or document when you enter the account number on a line, but you can delete or change the code on the line if appropriate. You can also require a dimension for posting an entry in a specific type of account. > 

> [!NOTE]
> Default dimension priorities open up for scenarios in sales and purchases that you might want to pay special attention to. When you use default dimension priorities on sales and purchase documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always considers the dimensions in the header as coming from the customer or vendor. This is true for dimensions that you set manually or by default, and is especially relevant when you use default dimensions on locations and items but not on customers or vendors.
>
> **Example**
>
> You have a scenario with the following dimension settings:
>
> * A customer without default dimensions
> * An item with ADM as the dimension value for the DEPARTMENT dimension
> * A location with PROD as the dimension value the DEPARTMENT dimension
> * Default dimension priorities are set as Customer > Item > Location
>
> When you create a new document in this scenario, dimensions are used as follows:
>
> * If you create a new document and add a location, the default value for new lines will be PROD. When you add lines with items, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will keep PROD because it comes from the header of the document.
>
> * If you create a new document and add items that have the ADM dimension value, and then specify a location in the header of the document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will ask whether you want to overwrite the existing lines because there's a conflict.
>
> We recommend that you to test your default dimensions setup, dimension priorities, and the order in which you enter data in documents.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dimensions**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Dimensions** page, select the relevant dimension, then choose the **Account Type Default Dim** action.  
3. Fill in a line for each new default dimension you want to set up. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]  
> If you want to require a dimension but don't want to assign a default value to the dimension, leave the **Dimension Value Code** field blank, then select **Code Mandatory** in the **Value Posting** field.  

> [!WARNING]  
> If an account is used in an **Adjust Exchange Rates** or **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job, do not select **Code Mandatory** or **Same Code**. These batch jobs cannot use dimension codes.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If an account must have a different dimension than the default dimension assigned to the account type, you must set up a new default dimension for the account. The default dimension for the account then replaces the default dimension for the account type.  

### To set up default dimension priorities

Different account types, such as a customer account and an item account, can have different default dimensions. As a result, an entry might have more than one  proposed default dimension. To avoid such conflicts, you can apply priority rules to the different sources.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Default Dimension Priorities**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Default Dimension Priorities** page, in the **Source Code** field, enter the source code for the entry table to which the default dimension priorities will apply.  
3. Fill in a line for each default dimension priority you want for the selected source code.
4. Repeat the procedure for each source code you want to set up default dimension priorities for.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you set up two tables with the same priority for the same source code, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always selects the table with the lowest table ID.  

### To set up dimension combinations

To avoid posting entries with contradictory or irrelevant dimensions, you can block or limit specific combinations of two dimensions. A blocked dimension combination means you can't post both dimensions on the same entry regardless of what the dimension values are. In contrast, a limited dimension combination means you can post both dimensions to the same entry, but only for certain combinations of dimension values.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dimension Combinations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Dimension Combinations** page, choose the dimension combination field you want from the following options.  

    |Field|Description|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No limitation**|This dimension combination has no restrictions. All dimensions values are allowed.|  
    |**Limited**|This dimension combination has restrictions depending on which dimension values that you enter. You must define the limitations on the **Dimension Value Combination** page.|  
    |**Blocked**|This dimension combination isn't allowed.|  

3. If you selected the **Limited** option, you must define which combinations of dimension values are blocked. To do this, choose the field to define the dimension value combination.  
4. Now select a dimension value combination that is blocked and enter **Blocked** in the field. A blank field means the dimension value combination is allowed. Repeat if multiple combinations are blocked.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The same dimensions are displayed in both rows and columns, meaning all dimension combinations appear two times. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically displays the setting in both fields. You cannot select anything in the fields from the upper-left corner and down, because those fields have the same dimension in both rows and columns.  
>
> The selected option is not visible before you exit the field.  
>
> To show the name of the dimensions instead of the code, select the **Show Column Name** field.

### To set up global and shortcut dimensions

Global and shortcut dimensions can be used as filters in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], including on reports, batch jobs, ledger entry pages, and analysis views. Global and shortcut dimensions can be inserted directly without first opening the **Dimensions** page. On journal and document lines, you can select global and shortcut dimensions in a field on the line. You can set up two global dimensions and eight shortcut dimensions. Choose the dimensions that you use most frequently.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Changing a global or shortcut dimension requires all entries posted with the dimension be updated. To change a global dimension, you can use the **Change Global Dimensions** function, but that can be time-consuming, may affect performance, and tables may be locked during the update. Make sure you choose your global and shortcut dimensions carefully so you won't have to change them later. To change a shortcut dimension, use the **Change Dimensions** action.
>
> Learn more in the [To change global dimensions](finance-dimensions.md#to-change-global-dimensions) section.

> [!NOTE]
> When you add or change a global or shortcut dimension, you are automatically signed out and back in so the new value is prepared for use.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, then choose the related link.
2. On the **Dimensions** FastTab, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

#### To change global dimensions

When you change a global or shortcut dimension, all entries posted with that dimension are updated. Because this process may be time-consuming and can affect performance, two different modes are provided to adapt the process to the size of the database.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Change Global Dimensions** action.
3. At the top of the page, select one of the following two modes for running the batch job.

    |Option|Description|
    |-|-|
    |**Sequential**|(Default) The change is done in one transaction that reverts all entries to the dimensions they had before the change.<br /><br />This option is recommended if the company has relatively few posted entries, in which case the batch job takes the shortest time to complete. The process locks multiple tables and blocks other users until it's done. Note that with large databases, the process might not complete in this mode. In that case, use the **Parallel** option.|
    |**Parallel**|The dimension change happens in multiple background sessions and the operation is split into multiple transactions. To use this option, turn on the **Parallel Processing** toggle. <br /><br />We recommended this option for large databases or companies with numerous posted entries because it will complete in the shortest time. Note that in this mode, the update process won't start if there's more than one active database session.|  

4. In the **Global Dimension 1 Code** and/or **Global Dimension 2 Code** fields, enter the new dimension(s). The current dimensions are displayed in gray behind the fields.
5. Depending on the mode, do one of the following:
    * In **Sequential** mode, choose the **Start** action.
    * In **Parallel** mode, choose the **Prepare** action.

    The **Log Entries** tab is filled with information about the dimensions to be changed.
6. Sign out of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], then sign in again.
7. Choose the **Start** action to begin the parallel processing of the dimension changes.

### Example of dimension setup

Let's say your company wants to track transactions based on organizational structure and geographic locations. To do that, you set up two dimensions on the **Dimensions** page:

* **AREA**  
* **DEPARTMENT**  

| Code | Name | Code Caption | Filter Caption |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AREA |Area |Area Code |Area Filter |
| DEPARTMENT |Department |Department Code |Department Filter |

For **AREA**, add the following dimension values:

| Code | Name | Dimension Value Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10 |Americas |Begin-Total |
| 20 |North America |Standard |
| 30 |Pacific |Standard |
| 40 |South America |Standard |
| 50 |Americas, Total |End-Total |
| 60 |Europe |Begin-Total |
| 70 |EU |Standard |
| 80 |Non-EU |Standard |
| 90 |Europe, Total |End-Total |

For the two main geographic areas, Americas and Europe, you add subcategories for regions by indenting the dimension values. This lets you report on sales or expenses in regions, and get totals for the larger geographic areas. You could also choose to use countries, regions, counties, or cities as your dimension values, depending on your business.

> [!NOTE]  
> To set up a hierarchy, the codes must be in alphabetical order. This includes the codes of the dimension values provided in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

For **DEPARTMENT**, add the following dimension values:

| Code | Name | Dimension Value Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ADMIN |Administration |Standard |
| PROD |Production |Standard |
| SALES |Sales |Standard |

With this setup, you can add your two dimensions as the two global dimensions on the **General Ledger Setup** page. This means you can use AREA and DEPARTMENT as filters for general ledger entries, as well as on all reports. Both global dimensions are also automatically available for use on entry lines and document headers as shortcut dimensions.

## Getting an overview of dimensions used multiple times

The **Default Dimensions-Multiple** page specifies how a group of accounts uses dimensions and dimension values. You can set this up by highlighting multiple accounts, then specifying default dimensions and dimension values for them. After that, the application suggests these dimensions and dimension values whenever one of these accounts is used, such as on a journal line. This makes entry posting easier for the user, as the dimension fields are filled in automatically. Also note, however, that the dimension values suggested can be changed on, for example, a journal line.

The **Default Dimensions-Multiple** page contains the following fields:

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|  
|**Dimension Code**|Shows all dimensions defined as default dimensions on one or more highlighted accounts. By choosing this field, you can see a list of all available dimensions. If you select a dimension, that dimension is defined as a default dimension for all highlighted accounts.|
|**Dimension Value Code**|Shows either a single dimension value or the term (Conflict). If a dimension value is shown in the field, then all highlighted accounts have the same default dimension value for a dimension. If the term (Conflict) is shown in the field, then not all highlighted accounts have the same default dimension value for a dimension. Upon choosing the **Dimension Code** field, you'll see a list of all available dimension values for a dimension. If you select a dimension value, it will be defined as a default dimension value for all highlighted accounts.|
|**Value Posting**|Shows either a single value posting rule or the term (Conflict). If a value posting rule is shown in the field, then all highlighted accounts have the same value posting rule for a dimension value. If the term (Conflict) is shown in the field, then not all the highlighted accounts have the same value posting rule for a dimension value. Upon choosing the **Value Posting** field, you'll see a list of value posting rules for a dimension. If you select a value posting rule, it will be applied to all highlighted accounts.|

## Use dimensions

In a document such as a sales order, you can add dimension information for both an individual document line and the document itself. So on the **Sales Order** page, you could enter dimension values for the first two shortcut dimensions on the individual sales lines, then add more dimension information if you choose the **Dimensions** button.  

If you work in a journal instead, you can add dimension information to an entry in the same way, if you have set up shortcut dimensions as fields directly on journal lines.  

You can also set up default dimensions for accounts or account types, so dimensions and dimension values are filled in automatically.

### To view global dimensions in ledger entry pages

Global dimensions are always company-defined and company-named. To see the global dimensions for your company, open the **General Ledger Setup** page.

In a ledger entry page, you can see whether there are global dimensions for the entries. The two global dimensions differ from your other dimensions because you can use them as filters anywhere in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**,  then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, choose the **Ledger Entries** action.  
3. To see only entries that are relevant, set one or more filters on the page.  
4. To see all the dimensions for an entry, select the entry, then choose the **Dimensions** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Ledger Entry Dimensions** page displays the dimensions one ledger entry at a time. You'll see as you scroll through the ledger entries, the content on the **Ledger Entry Dimensions** page changes accordingly.

# Reverse journal postings and undo receipts/shipments

Reverse journal postings are useful, for example, for correcting errors and for clearing out an old accruals entry before entering a new one. A reverse entry is the same as the original entry, but has an opposite sign in the **Amount** field. The reverse entry must have the same document number and posting date as the original entry. After you reverse an entry, you must make the correct entry.

You can only reverse entries that are posted from a general journal line. An entry can only be reversed one time.

To undo a receipt or shipment posting, before they're posted as invoiced, you can use the **Undo** function on the posted document. You can undo quantities of type **Item** and **Resource**.

If you posted an incorrect negative quantity, such as a purchase order with the wrong number of items, as received but not invoiced, you can undo the posting.

If you posted an incorrect positive quantity as shipped but not invoiced, you can undo the posting. For example, if you posted a sales shipment or a purchase return shipment with the wrong number of items.

> [NOTE!]
> Due to how [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] posts and updates amounts in an additional reporting currency (ACY), you can't use this feature if you use ACY. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] converts amounts in local currency to the alternate currency, but doesn't net transactions. If you use ACY, you must manually reverse the amounts.

## To reverse the journal posting of a general ledger entry

You can reverse entries from all **Ledger Entries** pages. The following procedure is based on the **General Ledger Entries** page.

> [!NOTE]
> The entry must originate from a journal posting.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Entries**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the entry that you want to reverse, and then choose the **Reverse Transaction** action.
3. On the **Reverse Transaction Entries** page, choose the **Reverse** action.
4. Choose **Yes** to confirm the reversal.

## To post a negative entry  

Use the **Correction** field to post a negative debit instead of a credit, or to post a negative credit instead of a debit on an account. By default, the field is available in all journals. The **Debit Amount** and **Credit Amount** fields include both the original entry, and the corrected entry. These fields have no effect on the account balance.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link  
2. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required batch name.  
3. Enter information into the relevant fields.  
4. In the journal line that you want to activate for negative entries, select the **Correction** check box.  
5. To post the journal, choose the **Post** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.

## To undo a quantity on a posted purchase receipt  

The following steps describe how to undo a posted receipt of items or resources. The steps are similar for posted shipments.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the posted receipt that you want to undo.  
3. Select the line or lines that you want to undo.  
4. Choose **Undo Receipt** action.

A corrective line is added under the selected receipt line. If the quantity was received in a warehouse receipt, then a corrective line is added on the posted warehouse receipt.  

The **Quantity Received** and **Qty. Rcd. Not Invoiced** fields on the related purchase order are set to zero.

## To undo and then redo a quantity on a posted return shipment

The following steps describe how to:

* Undo a posted return shipment of items or resources.
* Repost the purchase return with a new quantity.

The steps are similar for posted return receipts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Return Shipments**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the posted return shipment to undo.
3. Select the line or lines to undo.  

4. Choose the **Undo Return Shipment** action.  

    A corrective line is inserted in the posted document, and the **Return Qty. Shipped** and **Return Shpd. Not Invd.** fields on the return order are set to zero.  

    Now go back to the purchase return order and redo the posting.  

5. On the **Posted Return Shipment** page, take a note of the number in the **Return Order No.** field.  
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Return Orders**, and then select the related link.  
7. Open the return order in question, and then choose the **Reopen** action.  
8. Correct the entry in the **Quantity** field and post the purchase return order again.  

[!INCLUDE [rev-general-journal](includes/rev-general-journal.md)]

## Reverse a customer and vendor ledger entry with a realized gain or loss entry

You can use the **Reverse transaction** action to reverse payments that were applied to entries that originated in foreign currencies and were adjusted using the Exchange Rate Adjustment batch job. The feature works for both purchases and sales.

The following steps are a simple scenario that illustrates how it works:

1. Post a sales invoice for a customer using a foreign currency.
2. Adjust the exchange rate for that currency.
3. Post a payment applied to the invoice.
4. Unapply and reverse the payment transaction, for example, from the **Customer Ledger Entries** page.

# View Test Reports Before Posting
When you are ready to post a document, such as an order, invoice, or a credit memo, you can test the document to ensure that no issues exist that will block the posting.

> [!NOTE]  
>   The following procedure is about testing before posting a purchase document. The functionality works in the same way for sales documents.

## To print a test report before posting a purchase invoice
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the purchase invoice that you want to test.
3. Choose the **Test Report** action.  

All parts of the purchase invoice are tested, and the result is presented in a report. If the report indicates any errors or missing information, then you must correct the problem before posting the purchase invoice.

# Collect payments with SEPA Direct Debit

With your customer's consent, you can collect payments directly from the customer's bank account according to the SEPA format.  

First, set up the export format of the bank file that instructs your bank to perform a direct debit. Then, set up the customer's payment method. Last, set up the direct-debit mandate that reflects your agreement with the customer to collect their payments in a certain agreement period.  

To instruct the bank to transfer the payment amount from the customer's bank account to your company's account, you create a direct-debit collection entry, which holds information about bank accounts, the affected sales invoices, and the direct-debit mandate. You then export an XML file that is based on the collection entry, which you send to your bank for processing. Any payments that couldn't be processed will be communicated to you by your bank, and you must then manually reject the direct debit-collection entries in question.  

You can set up standard customer sales codes with the direct-debit payment method and mandate information. You can then use the **Create Standard Cust. Invoices** batch job to generate multiple sales invoices with the direct-debit information prefilled. This is can be done manually or automatically, according to the payment due date.  

When payments are successfully processed, as communicated by your bank, you can post the payment receipts either directly from the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page or by moving the payment lines to the journal where you post payment receipts, such as the **Cash Receipt Journals** page. Alternatively, depending on your cash management process, you can wait and just apply the payments as a part of bank reconciliation.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To collect payments using SEPA Direct Debit, the currency on the sales invoice must be EURO.  

## How to set up SEPA Direct Debit

From the **Direct Debit Collections** page, you can export instructions to your electronic bank to perform a direct debit collection from the customer's bank account to your bank account according to the SEPA Direct Debit format.

> [!NOTE]
> The global version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the SEPA direct debit format only. Your country/region version may support other formats for electronic payment. See under **Local Functionality** in the table of contents.  

To enable export of a bank file format that aren't supported out of the box in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can set up a data exchange definition by using the data exchange framework. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

Before you can process customer payments electronically by exporting direct debit instructions in the SEPA Direct Debit format, you must perform the following setup steps:  

* Set up the export format of the bank file that instructs your bank to perform a direct debit collection from the customer's bank account to your bank account.  
* Set up the customer's payment method.  
* Set up the direct-debit mandate that reflects your agreement with the customer to collect their payments in a certain agreement period.

Any payments that couldn't be processed by the bank will be communicated to you by your bank, and you must then manually reject the direct debit-collection entries in question.  

 > [!NOTE]  
 > To collect payments using SEPA Direct Debit, the currency on the sales invoice must be EURO.  

### To create a direct-debit collection  

 1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Direct Debit Collections**, and then choose the related link.  
 2. On the **Direct Debit Collections** page, choose the **Create Direct Debit Collection** action.

    |**To Due Date**|Specify the latest payment due date on sales invoices that you want to create a direct-debit collection for.|  
    |**Partner Type**|Specify if the direct-debit collection is made for customers of type **Company** or **Person**.|  
    |**Only Customers With Valid Mandate**|Specify if a direct-debit collection is created for customers who have a valid direct-debit mandate. **Note:**  A direct-debit collection is created even if the **Direct Debit Mandate ID** field isn't filled on the sales invoice.|  
    |**Only Invoices With Valid Mandate**|Specify if a direct-debit collection is only created for sales invoices if a valid direct-debit mandate is selected in the **Direct Debit Mandate ID** field on the sales invoice.|  
    |**Bank Account No.**|Specify which of your company's bank accounts the collected payment will be transferred to from the customer's bank account.|  
    |**Bank Account Name**|Specifies the name of the bank account that you select in the **Bank Account No.** field. This field is filled automatically.|  

 4. Choose the **OK** button.  

A direct-debit collection is added to the **Direct Debit Collections** page, and one or more direct-debit collection entries are created.

 If the exported file can't be processed, for example because the customer is insolvent, you can reject the direct-debit collection entry. If the exported file is successfully processed by the bank, the due payments of the involved sales invoices are automatically collected from the involved customers. In that case you can close the collection.  

### To reject a direct-debit collection entry  

* On the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page, select the entry that wasn't successfully processed, and then choose the **Reject Entry** action.  

    The value in the **Status** field on the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page is changed to **Rejected**.  

### To close a direct-debit collection

* On the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page, select the entry that was successfully processed, and then choose the **Close Collection** action.  

    The related direct-debit collection is closed.

# Create G/L budgets

Budgets play an important role in business intelligence. Examples include a financial statement based on financial reports that include budget entries or when analyzing budgeted versus actual amounts in the chart of accounts. To learn more, go to [Financial Reporting](bi.md).

You can create budgets for any given time period. However, most often businesses set up budgets for their fiscal year. You can create multiple budgets for the same period so you can work with multiple budget versions or revisions. You can create budgets for dimensions too, so you can analyze budget variances per dimension. You can work with up to four dimensions in a budget. To learn more, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

In cost accounting, you work with cost budgets in a similar way. To learn more, go to [Creating Cost Budgets](finance-create-cost-budgets.md).  

## To create a new G/L budget

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **G/L Budgets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Edit List** action, then fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Choose the **Edit Budget** action.
4. At the top of the **Budget** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

   The page shows only entries that contain the budget name you entered in the **Budget Name** field. Because you just created the budget name, there are no entries that match the filter. Therefore, the page is empty.  
5. To enter an amount, choose the relevant cell in the matrix. The **G/L Budget Entries** page opens.  
6. Create a new line and fill in the **Amount** field. Close the **G/L Budget Entries** page.  
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for all amounts in the budget.  

> [!NOTE]  
> On the **Filters** FastTab, you can filter the budget information by the budget dimensions you set up under the budget name.

## Exporting and importing G/L budgets with Excel

You can export data on budget pages to Microsoft Excel for further processing or analysis and then import budget data back in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Exporting G/L budgets to Excel

Exporting a G/L budget to an Excel workbook lets you work offline and using Excel's powerful data manipulation features.

To export the budget to Excel, follow these steps:

1. Open the Budget: Select the budget you want to work on from the list of G/L budgets. Choose the **Edit Budget** action.
1. To export to Excel, on the **Budget** page, choose **Export to Excel**.
1. Choose the dimensions and filters you want to include in the export. For example, you might want to filter by specific departments or projects.
1. To generate the Excel file, choose **OK**.
1. Save the exported Excel file to your local drive for further editing.

### Editing G/L budgets in Excel

After you export the G/L budget to Excel, you can fill in your budget data. Here's a few tips to be more effective and reduce errors:

- Add budget amounts for each combination of dimensions and periods. Ensure that the data is accurate and adheres to the formatting requirements of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, your numbering shouldn't have special characters or formatting.
- Take advantage of Excel features such as formulas, data validation, and conditional formatting to streamline data entry and ensure accuracy.
- Save the Excel file after you enter the budget data.
- Make local copies of your budgets as backups.

### Importing G/L budgets to Excel

After you add your budget numbers in a local Excel workbook, the next step is to import it back into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Do as follows to import the budget from Excel:

1. Open the Budget: Select the budget you want to work on from the list of G/L budgets. Choose the **Edit Budget** action.
1. To import from Excel, on the **Budget** page, choose **Import from Excel**.
1. Choose the Excel file from your local drive. You can choose which budget you're uploading to and whether to add or replace the entries. The **Add** action adds the entries from Excel to entries that already exist. The **Replace** action overwrites entries existing entries in the budget.
1. If everything looks correct, choose **OK** to complete the import process. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the budget with the imported data.

### Scenario example: setting budget targets for payroll expenses

You know that the new budgeted salaries cost is going to be 1.200.000 in local currency (LCY). You want to enable the Salaries department to budget for the three specific lines (of the Posting account type) for full-time employees, part-time employees, and temp help. The three lines are grouped under a Salaries heading line.

You enter 1.200.000 on the Heading line, export the budget to Excel, then send it to the Salaries department, telling them to distribute the LCY 1.200.000.

The Salaries department distributes the amount on the three posting accounts. When you import back into the G/L budget, the three accounts are filled in with the new Excel data, summing to LCY 1.200.000, and the Heading line is blank.

> [!NOTE]
> The chart of accounts, which general ledger (G/L) budgets are based on, has lines of the account type Heading. These lines contain the total of the lines below it. When you export a G/L budget, you export data on all lines regardless of the account type. However, you can only import data on lines of the Posting account type. Similarly, when you import a G/L budget, any values on Heading lines are deleted. They're deleted to avoid incorrect totals after you import data that was created or edited in Excel.

## Tips for effective budget management

Here are some tips for effective budget management:

- Regular Updates: Periodically update your G/L budgets to reflect changes in your financial plans and business environment. You can copy any of the budgets and turn them into forecasts.
- Version Control: Maintain different versions of your budget to compare actual performance against various scenarios.
- Collaboration: Encourage collaboration by involving relevant stakeholders in the budgeting process, ensuring that the budget is comprehensive and realistic.

# Troubleshooting Your Company Hub

Adding companies to the company hub dashboard is easy enough, but this article addresses issues that you may have on the way.  

## Check errors

Use the **Check Errors** action to view a list of recent errors. You can see additional details for each error, and you can clean up the log by deleting older entries.  

## Connection failed

There can be a couple of reasons why you cannot connect to a company, including the following:

- The URL in the **Environment Link** field is not valid  

  Go to the **Environment Links** page, open the environment that you cannot connect to, and then choose the **Test the connection** action.  
- The client's company is currently offline, for example if it being upgraded

  In your dashboard, choose the **Tools** menu item, and then choose **Check Errors**. This opens a list with technical details, so you might want to contact your administrator if you're seeing errors. For example, the error message "*The server has rejected the client credentials*" suggests that you do not have access.  
- You do not have access to all companies in the environment that you are trying to connect to

  In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an organization can have multiple business units called companies, and you might not have access to all companies. Work with your administrator or client to make sure that you have access to the companies that you have to work in.  

## Data does not refresh

When you add a company or request a refresh of the data, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fetches the data. But you must refresh the page yourself, such as choosing the **Reload all companies** action, refresh the browser page, navigate away from the dashboard and then back again, or similar.  

If you've added a company but it is not displaying in the list, you can also use the **Reload all companies** action to update the list.

# Handling inventory and manufacturing costs

Although much of the cost accounting functionality is expressed in underlying processes with no user interaction, such as entry application and automatic cost adjustment, many fields, pages, and reports are aimed at users who directly or indirectly manage the cost of items or operations.  

 Assigning item charges to purchase documents is an example of an indirect cost accounting task. Updating the unit cost of assembly or production BOM item is an example of a more direct cost accounting task.  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.   

|**To**|**See**|  
|------------|-------------|  
|Periodically or automatically update the unit cost of one or multiple items to forward any cost changes from inbound entries, such as those for purchases or production output, to the related outbound entries, such as consumption or transfers.|[Adjust Item Costs](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md)|  
|Get insight into average cost dynamics to make pricing decisions or to track cost fluctuations caused by data entry errors.|[Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md)|  
|Create a manufacturing item's standard cost by entering the three cost elements: material cost, capacity cost, and subcontractor cost.|[About Calculating Standard Cost](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md)|

# Accessibility and Keyboard Shortcuts

This article provides information about the features that make [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] readily available to people with disabilities. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the following accessibility features:  

- Keyboard shortcuts. See [Keyboard Shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md).
- Touch and pen gestures on tablets and phones. See [Touch and Pen Gestures](touch-gestures.md).
- Navigation  
- Headings  
- Alternative text for images and links  
- Support for common assistive technologies 
- Zoom in or out on any page
- Tooltips on elements in the user interface

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## <a name="Navigation"></a> Navigation
  
You can use different combinations of the Tab, Shift, and arrow keys of your keyboard to move between elements on a page. Elements include actions, fields and columns, parts, and other controls. In general, select <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to move to the next or previous element.

When you focus on an area that contains actions, like the navigation bar on the top of role center or action bar on other pages, use the arrows keys to move through the different actions and groups. Select <kbd>Enter</kbd> on a group to open its underlying actions, and then continue using the arrows keys. Select <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to move out of the action area.

By using the tab order, you can also switch between the main browser page and dialog boxes that request confirmation, for example, or the sign-in page.  

## <a name="Headings"></a> Headings in Content

The HTML source for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] content uses tags to help users of assistive technology to understand the structure and content of the page. For example, on list pages, the columns are defined in TH tags and the column headings are set with TITLE attribute inside the tag. Captions for elements, such as FastTabs, FactBoxes, and fields are included in heading tags (H1, H2, H3, and H4).  

## <a name="Images"></a> Image and Links

A descriptive text for images is set with the ALT attribute inside the IMG tag. A descriptive text for hyperlinks is set with the title attribute inside the A tag.  

## <a name="AssistiveTech"></a> Assistive Technologies

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports various assistive technologies, such as high contrast, screen readers, and voice recognition software. Some assistive technologies may not work well with certain elements in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] pages.  

## <a name="zoom"></a> Zoom

Most browsers use standard keyboard shortcuts to zoom in and out on the current page. These keyboard shortcuts aren't specific to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], but they work when you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a browser. For a list of supported keyboard shortcuts, see [Keyboard Shortcuts for Zooming In and Out](keyboard-shortcuts.md#zoomshortcuts).

## Tooltips

Tooltips are available on most elements in the user interface, like page fields and columns, actions, cues tiles, and charts. A tooltip provides extra text that explains an element to help you better understand its purpose. 

Tooltips are accessed in different ways, depending on the client (web or mobile) and the device that you're working with. Use the following table as a guide. Some tooltips can be read by screen-readers. In this case, you access the tooltips as described in the table, then use the screen reader to navigate to the tooltip as you would with any other element.

#### Accessing tooltips

|Element|Mouse action for web client|Keyboard shortcut for web client|Touch gesture on tablet/phone for mobile app|Screen reader support|
|-------|-----------------|------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
|Page fields and column headings|Hover over or click the field caption or column heading|Move focus to the field or column heading, and select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> keys|Tap the field caption |yes|

# Allocate revenue and costs to multiple general ledger accounts

This article describes how to use allocation accounts to distribute amounts on sales and purchase documents and general journal lines to different G/L accounts. You can allocate amounts through a fixed or variable distribution.  

Allocation splits a general journal line into the lines defined on the **Allocation Account** page. For example, if you split a rent expense three ways using dimensions, you'll have three lines to post for the allocation. Therefore, you'll have six G/L lines (or possibly more if you're using VAT or sales tax). Although this posts more G/L entries than you might need, it allows you to reverse individual lines instead of reversing the whole allocation.

Allocation accounts also work with deferrals. To learn more about deferrals, go to [Defer Revenues and Expenses](finance-how-defer-revenue-expenses.md).

The following table introduces the allocation methods you can use.

|Allocation Method  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Fixed     | When you want to split up expenses in a way that's repeated over a longer period of time, you can use a fixed allocation. A fixed allocation lets you define the allocation split. This split will only change when you change the setup on the **Allocation Account** page.        |
|Variable     | To distribute revenue or expenses based on values that change over time, use the variable allocation method. Variable allocations let you specify the sources to use to calculate the allocation percentages. This method is useful, for example, for splitting employee costs that according to varying headcounts in departments or divisions. Another example is the distributing the cost of rent based on production floor footage that might vary per production line over time. Variable allocations use a combination of dimensions and statistical accounts to determine how amounts distribute over a period of time. To learn more about statistical accounts, go to [Analyze Data with Statistical Accounts](bi-use-statistical-accounts.md). To learn more about dimensions, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).        |

## Use a fixed share or percentage method to allocate amounts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Allocation Account**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Allocation Accounts** page, choose **New**.
1. Fill in the **No.** and **Name** fields.
1. In the **Account Type** field, choose **Fixed**.
1. In the **Destination Account Type** field, choose **G/L Account** or **Bank Account**.
1. In the **Destination Account Number** field, choose the account to post the value to.
1. Optional: Choose the **Dimensions** action, and then specify the dimensions to post for the line.
1. In the **Share** and **Percent** fields, specify how to distribute amounts to the destination account.
  
   > [!TIP]
   > If you enter the actual amount to allocate for a fixed allocation in the **Share** field, the **Percent** field shows the percentage of the total amount.
1. Repeat this process for each account to include in the allocation.

## Use a variable method to allocate amounts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Allocation Account**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Allocation Accounts** page, choose **New**.
1. Fill in the **No.** and **Name** fields.
1. In the **Account Type** field, choose **Variable**.
1. In the **Destination Account Type** field, choose **G/L Account**.
1. In the **Destination Account Number** field, choose the account to post the value to.
1. In the **Breakdown Account Type** field, choose **Statistical Account**.
1. In the **Calculation Period** field, choose the period for which to distribute amounts.
1. Optional: To filter on specific global dimension values, choose the **Breakdown account balance filters** action, and then specify the filter values.
1. Optional: Choose the **Dimensions** action, and then specify the dimensions to post for the line.

## Allocate amounts on the fly

You create allocation accounts to split revenue and costs for G/L accounts and bank accounts. Automating allocation can save time. However, if you want to use allocation accounts, but you don't want to create them for each G/L account, you can save even more time.

The Inherit from parent option lets you use the allocation account to split amounts for any G/L account on a line on a document or journal. In the **Account Type** field on a document or journal line, you choose a G/L account, and then choose the allocation account in the **Allocation Account No.** field. The amount on the line is split for the G/L account according to the setup in your allocation account. It's a less transparent way of allocating, but you don't have to create an allocation account specifically for the G/L account.

Ad-hoc allocations are easy to set up. Instead of specifying a bank or G/L account in the **Destination Account Type** field on the **Allocation Account** page, choose the **Inherit from parent** option. Leave the **Destination Account Number** field blank. When you choose the G/L account on the document or journal line, that account is used to allocate amounts.

## Verify that amounts distribute correctly before you post them

There are a couple of ways to verify that amounts distribute correctly:

* On the **Allocation Account** page, choose the **Test Allocation** action. Use the **Amount to Allocate** field to test different amounts.
* On the **General Ledger Journals** page, choose the journal, and then use the **Posting Preview** action.

## Adjust the distribution

If you find something in an allocation that you'd like to change, you can adjust the allocation before you post it.  

1. Open the document or journal that has the allocation you want to change.
1. Choose the line, and then choose the **Redistribute Account Allocations** action.
1. On the **Change Allocations** page, make your adjustment.

## Post an allocation transaction

The following steps describe how to post an allocation transaction from a general journal. The steps are the same for sales and purchase documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Create a new line. Fill in the fields in the same way you would for any other type of general journal.
1. If you're using a fixed or variable allocation, fill in the following fields:
    1. In the **Account Type** field, choose **Allocation Account**.
    1. In the **Account No.** field, choose the allocation account.
1. If you're using an allocation that uses the Inherit from parent option, do the following:
    1. In the **Account Type** field, choose **G/L Account**.
    1. In the **Account No.** field, choose the G/L account.
    1. In the **Allocation Account No.** field, choose the allocation account that's set up to use the Inherit from parent option. 
1. Choose **Post**.

# Setting Up Manufacturing

To convert material into produced end items, production resources, such as bills of material, routings, machine operators, and machinery must be set up in the system.

Operators and machines are represented in the system as machine centers that may be organized in work centers and work center groups. When these resources are established, they can be loaded with operations according to the item's defined material (BOM) and process (routing) structure, and according to the capacity of the machine or work center. You can also set the production capacity of each resource. Capacity is defined by the work time available in the machine and work centers, and is governed by calendars for each level. A work center calendar specifies the working days or hours, shifts, holidays, and absence that determine the work center's gross available capacity (typically measured in minutes). All of this is determined by defined efficiency and capacity values.  

When you have set up manufacturing, you can plan and execute production orders. For more information, see [Planning](production-planning.md) and [Manufacturing](production-manage-manufacturing.md).  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Prioritize Vendors

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can suggest various payments to vendors, for example, payments that will be due soon or payments where a discount is available. For more information, see [Suggest Vendor Payments](payables-how-suggest-vendor-payments.md).

First, you must prioritize your vendors by assigning numbers to them.
<br><br>
> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=283f5ccb-3cbb-48c5-b50d-fd91466e8094]

## To prioritize vendors

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant vendor, and then choose **Edit**.
3. In the **Priority** field, enter a number.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] considers the lowest number, except 0, to have the highest priority. So, for example, if you use 1, 2, and 3, then 1 will have the highest priority.

If you do not want to prioritize a vendor, leave the **Priority** field blank. Then, if you use the payment suggestion feature, the vendor will be listed after all the vendors that have a priority number. You can enter as many priority levels as necessary.

# Setting up sales

Before you can manage sales processes, you must configure the rules and values that define the company's sales policies.

You must define the general setup on the **Sales & Receivables** page, such as which sales documents are required, how their values are posted, and the type of lines to create by default. This general setup is typically performed once during the initial implementation.

A separate series of tasks related to registering new customers is to record any special price or discount agreements that you have with each customer. For more information, see [Record Special Sales Prices and Discounts](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

Finance-related sales setup, such as payment methods and currencies, are covered in the Finance Setup section. For more information, see [Setting Up Finance](finance-setup-finance.md).

# Troubleshooting Self-Service Sign-Up
Signing up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is easy and can be done very quickly. You can create a free account even if you are an existing organization. This article addresses issues that you may have during signup.

## What email address can I use with Business Central?
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] requires that you use a work, or school, email address to sign up. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does not support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunication providers. This includes outlook.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com, and others.

If you try to sign up with a personal email address, you will get a message indicating to use a work or school email address.

## Troubleshooting
In many cases, registering for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can be achieved by following the sign-up process. However, there are several reasons why you may not be able to complete self-service signup. The table below summarizes some of the most common reasons you may not be able to complete signup and ways you can workaround these issues.

| Symptom/Error Message | Cause and Workaround |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |

# Set Up Customer Price Groups
  
Sales prices can be made dependent on the customer groups to which you sell. These are called customer price groups.

Before you set up customer price groups, you must decide how many groups you want and which customers will belong to each group.  

## How to create sales prices for a group of customers  

When you have agreed on the prices that the group of customers will pay for certain items, you register the agreement for the individual items on the lines in the **Sales Prices** page.

### To create sales prices for a group of customers

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer Price Groups**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Select the line for the customer price group. If a line does not already exist you can create a new line. Select **New** to create a new entity and give it a name.  
    
    For the selected line, verify the contents of the fields **Allow Line Disc.**, **Allow Invoice Disc.**, **Price Includes Tax** and **Tax Bus. Posting Gr. (Price)**. 
  
3. Select the **Navigate** action, and choose **Sales Prices**. The **Sales Prices** page opens. The **Sales Type** field will be filled in with **Customer Price Group**.  
  
4. Fill in the **Sales Code** with the sales code you selected on the previous page.  
  
5. Fill in the fields on the lines with the **Item No.**, **Unit of Measure Code**, and the agreed **Unit Price**. You can also show the **Variant Code** column and specify the **Variant Code** if there are several variants of the item.  
  
6. If the customer group needs to purchase a minimum quantity in order to gain the price agreed on, fill in the **Minimum Quantity** field.  

7. If required, enter the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** of the price agreement.  
  
8. If relevant, you can also specify the **Currency Code**.

Repeat steps 4 through 8 for each item that you want to create a Sales Price for.

## How to enter customer price group codes on customer cards  

After you have set up the customer price groups, you can enter the customer price group codes on the customer cards.

### To enter customer price group codes on a customer card  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Open the relevant **Customer Card** for a customer that you want to be part of a customer price group.  

3. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, in the **Customer Price Group** field, select the **Customer Price Group** code.

# About calculating standard cost

Many manufacturing companies select a valuation base of standard cost. This choice also applies to companies that do light manufacturing, such as assembly and kitting. A standard cost system determines inventory unit cost based on some reasonable historical or expected cost. Studies of past and estimated future cost data can provide the basis for standard costs. These costs are frozen until a decision is made to change them. The actual cost to produce a product can differ from the estimated standard costs. For management control, the actual cost is compared to the standard cost for a specific item and differences, or *variances*, are identified and analyzed.  

Standard costs can be maintained for items that are replenished through purchase, assembly, and production. For each replenishment method, standard costs can consist of the following elements.  

|Replenishment System|Standard Cost Elements|  
|--------------------------|----------------------------|  
|**Purchase**|Direct material cost and overhead material cost if it's required.|  
|**Assembly**|Direct material cost, direct or fixed labor cost, and overhead cost.|  
|**Prod. Order**|Direct material cost, labor cost, subcontractor cost, and overhead cost.|  

## Set up standard costs

Because the standard cost of a produced or assembled item can consist of multiple cost elements, including material, capacity (labor) and direct and overhead subcontractor costs, standard costs must be established for each of these elements.  

The accounting task for an item-processing company using standard costing is to:  

- Estimate a standard cost of the finished item and set it up on the item card.  
- Record and allocate the actual cost of the key cost elements and to account for variances.  

To determine the direct cost of a finished item, all component costs must be totaled. An assembled or produced item can include subassemblies, which also consist of multiple components.  

The following key cost elements make up the total direct cost of a finished processed item:  

- Material costs.  
- Capacity cost.  
- Subcontracting costs for produced items only.  

### Material costs

Material costs are costs that are associated with subassemblies and purchased raw material. Material unit cost can consist of direct and indirect cost elements.  

- Direct material cost represents an invoiced amount for purchased raw materials or the processing cost of a subassembly.  
- Indirect material cost, or *overhead*, can represent elements such as inventory carrying costs for the finished item after it's produced.  

The setup of the material cost for purchased items that affect direct and indirect cost depends on the costing method that you have selected for the specified item. You set up cost information for either costing method on the item card. For more information, see [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

The cost of scrap (production only) is another factor to consider when you calculate the total material cost. When a certain amount of raw material is scrapped when you assemble or produce an item, it generally causes an increase in the quantity of components that are required to produce this item. This increases the material cost of the components that are consumed when producing a parent item. You set up scrap cost for materials on either the production BOM or routing.  

The material cost of a produced item can be represented in two ways that correspond to the following cost calculation bases.  

|Cost Calculation Basis|Material Cost Calculation|  
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|  
|Single level|Produced item is equal to the total cost of all purchased or subassembled items on that item's production BOM.|  
|Rolled-up level or multilevel|Produced item is the sum of the material cost for all subassemblies on that item's BOM and the cost of all purchased items on that item's production BOM.|  

### Capacity costs

Capacity costs are the costs that are associated with internal labor and machine costs. You must set up these costs for each resource (in assembly management) and work or machine center on the routing (in production). As with materials, you can identify both direct and indirect elements of capacity cost. For example, the direct cost for a work center can be the established shop rate to perform a specific function. The indirect cost for a work center can represent some general factory expenses, such as lighting, heating, and so on. As with material costs, you can express capacity overhead as an indirect cost percentage or a fixed overhead rate.  

The setup of the capacity costs of assembled items consists of the following elements:  

- Direct and indirect unit cost of the resource.  
- Fixed or direct resource usage type.  

The setup of the capacity costs of produced items consists of the following elements:  

- Direct and indirect unit cost of the machine or work center.  
- Time and lot size setup.  

To calculate standard capacity cost, you have to establish the standard time rates that are required to perform operations on machine and work centers. The total time to complete an operation typically consists of setup, run time, and wait and move time.  

You set up the rates for each time type for each machine or work center on an individual routing.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  While run time rates apply for each item unit that is produced, the setup time rates apply for each lot. Therefore, you must prorate the routing setup time for each operation over the lot size. You specify the lot size in the corresponding field on the **Replenishment** FastTab of the **Item Card** page.  

To specify setup time on the routing for planning but not include this expense in the standard cost calculation, clear the **Cost Incl. Setup** field on the **Manufacturing Setup** page.  

On a single-level basis, this is the labor cost that is required to produce the finished production item and is specified on the production item's routing. On a multi-level basis, this is the capacity cost that is specified for each individually produced item that is included in the parent item's BOM.  

### Subcontractor costs

Subcontractor costs are the costs that are associated with services that are provided by a company's outside vendors or subcontractors. Similar to material and capacity, subcontractor costs can consist of both direct and overhead amounts. Direct subcontractor cost represents the actual charge for each unit of services that is provided. For example, overhead subcontractor cost can represent freight and handling costs that the company incurs with a subcontracted order.  

Because subcontracting is an outsourced capacity, you set up the cost of both direct and indirect subcontracting services on the work center card that represents the subcontracting operation.  

## Populate standard cost

You can set standard cost manually or you can calculate the item's standard cost from the **Item card** page. Choose the **Production** group, then choose the **Calc. Production Std Cost** action to update cost of production items or choose the **Assembly** group, then choose the **Calc. Assembly Std. Cost** action to update cost of assembly item. The actions will consolidate and roll up the component and capacity costs to calculate the total assembly or manufacturing cost of the items. 

To calculate the unit cost of an assembly or production BOM, the parent item and its component items must use the Standard costing method. Any resources in the BOM are rolled up if they have a unit cost that is defined on the item, resource. workcenter card. Not cost defined on stockkeeping unit (SKU). 

If you have open entries, after implementing the changes to **Standard Cost** field on the item card, remember to perform inventory revaluation. For more information, see [Revalue Inventory](inventory-how-revalue-inventory.md).

## Updating standard costs with Standard Cost Worksheet

The **Standard Cost Worksheet** is intended as a tool for purchasers, production or assembly managers, and internal controllers when they have to review and update standard costs.

Use the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page to do the following:

- Prepare the changes in advance of the date when they have to take effect.
- Simulate the effect on the cost of the manufactured or assembled item if the standard cost for consumption, production capacity usage, or assembly resource usage is changed.
- Execute the changes at a given date and let them take effect immediately.

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel](includes/edit-in-excel.md)]

Purchasers use the [**Suggest Item Standard Cost**](#suggest-item-standard-cost) batch job to update and work with the costs of purchased items in one worksheet. When the result is satisfactory, the worksheet is given to the internal controller.

Production or assembly managers use the [**Suggest Work/Mach Ctr Std Cost**](#suggest-workmach-ctr-std-cost) batch job to update and work with the production capacity costs and assembly resource costs of processed items in another worksheet. This worksheet is also given to the internal controller.

Internal controllers use the [**Copy Standard Cost Worksheet**](#copy-standard-cost-worksheet) batch job to consolidate the worksheets into one worksheet. Use the [**Roll Up Standard Cost**](#roll-up-standard-cost) batch job to make a roll-up of the costs from the purchaser and the production or assembly manager. The roll-up determines the standard costs of manufactured and assembled items. Controllers can preview cost changes before and after the roll-up to identify unacceptable deviations. When the updates are acceptable, the controller implements the changes to take effect on a given date.

Use the [**Implement Standard Cost Change**](#implement-standard-cost-change) batch job to implement the standard cost changes, which updates the standard costs on the item cards of the items that are included in the worksheet. It also creates revaluation journal lines so that you can update the items in stock with the new standard cost.

### To update standard costs

1. Run the **Adjust Cost-Item Entries** batch job. To start the batch job, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Adjust Cost-Item Entries**, and then choose the related link. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
2. Run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job. To start the batch job, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**, and then choose the related link. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Standard Cost Worksheet**, and then use one or more of the following actions:
    1. Run the **Suggest Item Standard Cost** batch job.  
    2. Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
    3. Run the **Suggest Capacity Standard Cost** batch job.  
    4. Review the results and make changes as necessary.
    5. Run the **Roll Up Standard Cost** batch job.
    6. Review the results and make changes as necessary.
    7. Run the **Implement Standard Cost Changes** batch job.  
4. Review and post the **Revaluation Journal** page, which has been populated with entries from the previous steps in this process.  

### Suggest Item Standard Cost

Creates suggestions for changing the costs and cost shares of standard costs on item cards. When the batch job has completed, you can see the result in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

> [!NOTE]  
> This batch job is intended for purchased items only. If you want to update an item with a production BOM or assembly BOM, then you must first fill in the worksheet with all the components and then run the **Roll Up Standard Cost** batch job.

This batch job only creates suggestions. It doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them,  then select **Implement Standard Cost Changes** in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

#### Options

**Standard Cost**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the standard cost. You can also select a rounding method for the new standard cost. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

**Indirect Cost %**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the indirect cost %. You can also select a rounding method for the new indirect cost %. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

**Overhead Rate**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the overhead rate. You can also select a rounding method for the new overhead rate. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

### Suggest Work/Mach Ctr Std Cost

Creates suggestions for changing the costs and cost shares of standard costs on work center, machine center, or resource cards. When the batch job has completed, you can see the result in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

This batch job only creates suggestions. It doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them,  then select **Implement Standard Cost Changes** in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

When you have run the batch job and want to see the impact on your production or assembly departments, then you run the **Roll Up Standard Cost** batch job to update standard costs on work centers, machine centers, assembly resources, production BOMs, and assembly BOMs.

#### Options
**Standard Cost**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the standard cost. You can also select a rounding method for the new standard cost. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

**Indirect Cost %**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the indirect cost %. You can also select a rounding method for the new indirect cost %. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

### Copy Standard Cost Worksheet

Copies standard cost worksheets from several sources into the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

You can only copy one worksheet at a time. The lines from the copied worksheets will be placed below each other in the consolidated worksheet. Item lines are listed first, then work/machine center lines are listed, and resource lines are listed last.

### Roll up standard cost

Rolls up the standard costs of assembled and manufactured items. These are influenced by the change in standard costs of components suggested by the **Suggest Item Standard Cost** batch job. In addition, they're influenced by the change in standard cost of production capacity and assembly resources suggested by the **Suggest Work/Mach Ctr Std Cost** batch job.

Once you have run either or both of these batch jobs and you do the roll-up, then all changes to the standard costs in the worksheet are introduced in the associated production or assembly BOMs, and the costs are applied at each BOM level.

> [!NOTE] 
> This function only rolls up the standard cost on the item cards, not on the SKU cards.

This batch job only creates suggestions. It doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them, then you can use the **Implement Standard Cost Change** batch job. 

#### Options

**Calculation Date**: Enter the date that applies to the production BOM version you want to do the roll-up for.
 
### Implement standard cost change

Updates the changes in the standard cost in the **Item** table with the ones in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page. The standard cost change suggestions can be created with the **Suggest Item Standard Cost** and/or the **Suggest Work/Mach Ctr Std Cost** batch job, and they can also be modified. The contents of all the fields in the standard cost change suggestions are transferred. When you implement suggestions of changes to standard costs, you can see them on the item card and/or on the work/machine center cards. A revaluation journal is also created for you to update the value of existing stock.

#### Options

**Posting Date**: Enter the date that the revaluation should take place.

**Document No.**: Enter the number of the revaluation journal lines. If there's a number series set up on the item journal batch name, the document number follows the ledger entries made by the posting of the revaluation journal. Otherwise, you can manually enter a number.

# Cancel production orders that have consumption

Even when production doesn't go as planned, it's important to keep your inventory, cost, and financial records accurate. You can revert consumption or output transactions, return unused raw materials, and correct mistakes in your reported operations. For actual scrap occurrences, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a process that lets you close orders and write off accumulated WIP.

When you post production transactions by mistake, you probably want to cancel (undo the transactions) and in some cases close the order. To do that, from the **Released Production Order** page, you can open the **Item Ledger entries** or **Capacity Ledger entries** pages and use the **Reverse Production Order Transaction** action.

- For item ledger entries of the type **Consumption**, the action creates item journal lines of the type **Consumption**. For the lines, it copies values from the original transaction, uses the opposite sign in the **Quantity** field, applies to the original entry, and posts the item journal.
- For item ledger entries of the types **Output** or **Capacity**, the action creates item journal lines of the type **Output**. For the lines, it copies values from original transaction, uses the opposite sign in the **Quantity**, **Scrap Quantity**, **Setup Time**, and **Run time** fields, applies to the original entry (only for item ledger entries), and posts the item journal. It also removes the **Finished** status from the related production routing line.

The **Reverse Production Order Transaction** action is only enabled for entries that are related to the production order. It uses the original posting date.

The action isn't supported under the following conditions:

- If the output entry was already applied to an outbound transaction.
- If consumption/output involve warehouse handling. Bins are supported.
- Entries were created through subcontracting purchase orders. You can undo receipt in the Posted Purchase Receipt page.

## Undo subcontracting receipts

You can undo subcontracting receipts before you post them as invoiced. To do so, go to the posted purchase receipt, select the line, and choose the **Undo** action. As a result, an identical line with an opposite sign in the **Quantity** field is created along with the capacity ledger entry. And, if the canceled receipt line is linked to the last routing operation, an item ledger entry of the type **Output**. You can't reverse a receipt if it's invoiced or if the production order is finished.

> [!NOTE]
> If posting a subcontracting receipt caused consumption of components due to the flushing method, the consumption transactions aren't reverted. You must reverse them separately by using an output journal or the **Reverse Production Order Transaction** action.

After you revert and correct the records, you can change the status of the production order to **Finished**. The steps and settings are the same for a scenario where there is no output to allocate accumulated WIP because of actual scrap. To set this up, turn on the **Finish Order Without Output** toggle on the **Manufacturing Setup** page.

> [!NOTE]
> After you turn on the toggle, you can't turn it off again. However, you can decide whether to write-off WIP for each order individually.

When you change the status of a released production order that has consumption or capacity ledger entries but no output, you can turn on the **Allow Finishing Prod. Order with no output** toggle on the **Change production order status** page.

The accumulated WIP amounts are posted to your inventory adjustment account. Remember to fill in the **Inventory Adjustment Account** on the **General Posting Setup** page for the entry defined by:

- The **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** field on the production order.
- The **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** field on the produced item.

## Reopen a finished production order to make corrections

After you complete a production order and set its status to **Finished**, you might discover a mistake. For example, you might find that consumption is missing or the item tracking information is incorrect. To make sure that your inventory and cost transactions are correct, use the **Reopen** action on the **Finished Production Orders** page to make adjustments. However, to protect your data there are a few restrictions:

- You can only reopen an order one time.
- You can't reopen an order that has no output and cost was written off to an adjustment account.

# View Archived Workflow Step Instances

All completed workflow step instances are saved on the **Archived Workflow Step Instances** page.  

On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling in fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios supported by the application code. Learn more at [Create Approval Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> To view the history and status of workflows using Power Automate integration, choose the **My flows** action on the **Power Automate** page, then choose a flow to view its run history and status.

## To view archived workflow step instances

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Open the workflow for which you want to view all archived workflow step instances.  
3. On the **Workflow** page, choose the **Archived Workflow Step Instances** action.

# Setting up user accounts for integrating with Microsoft Dataverse via data sync

This article provides an overview of how to set up the user accounts that are required to integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Set up the administrator user account

To set up the connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], you must sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with a user account that is assigned to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Essential or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Premium license. We'll use this account one time to install and configure some required components.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During set-up, you'll be asked to provide credentials for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment. Provide the credentials of an account that is a licensed user and assigned to the **System Administrator** security role on the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment and [User Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#user-administrator) role on the tenant to which the environment belongs. This account doesn't need a license to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] because it will be used only to do set-up tasks in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment.
>
> After the connection setup is done, you can remove this [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] user. The integration will continue using the user account that is automatically created specifically for the integration.

## Permissions and security roles for user accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]

The Base Integration Solution creates the following role in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] for the integration:

* **Business Central Dataverse Integration** - Allows you to manage the connection between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Typically, this is assigned only to the automatically created user account for synchronization.

> [!NOTE]
> Only the application user who runs the integration should have the **Business Central Dataverse Integration** role. The application user doesn't need the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] licenses.

When you install the Base Integration Solution, it configures the permissions for the integration user account. If those permissions are changed manually, you can reset them. Choose **Redeploy Integration Solution** on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page to reinstall the Base Integration Solution. This step will deploy the  Business Central Integration security role.

<!--
The following tables list the minimum permissions for the user accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

# Database Wait Statistics in [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)]

The administrators and developers can have insights into the database performance by looking at **Database Wait Statistics** in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The information presented by **Database Wait Statistics** can help to check the kind of resources that are being used and the kind of delays that are being faced by the database processes. By analyzing these wait statistics, you can find the root cause of the slow performance by your database and can eventually make better decisions for the application performance.

For more information about the database wait statistics, see [Database Wait Statistics in Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/database-wait-statistics).

# Make sales quotes

You create a sales quote to record your offer to a customer or a prospect to sell certain products on certain delivery and payment terms. You can send the sales quote to the customer to communicate the offer. You can email the document as a PDF attachment. You can also have the email body prefilled with a summary of the quote. For more information, see [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md#to-send-documents-by-email).

While you negotiate with the customer or prospect, you can change and resend the sales quote as much as needed. When the customer accepts the quote, you convert the sales quote to a sales invoice or a sales order in which you process the sale. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md) or [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

In most cases, you send sales quotes to prospective customers. You often have a contact person that you negotiate with. If they then accept your offer, you turn the sales quote into an order and register the prospect as a customer in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In the following procedure, we focus on contacts, but you can also send quotes to existing customers.  

## To create a sales quote

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Quotes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Specify the contact or customer that you want to send the sales quote to.

    - If the sales quote is for an existing contact, then specify the name in the **Contact No.** field.  

        If the sales quote is for an existing customer, specify the customer in the **Customer** field.
    - If the contact isn't registered, follow these steps:

        1. In the **Contact No.** field, choose the edit button :::image type="icon" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" border="false":::.
        2. In the dialog box about selecting the contact, choose the **New** action, and then fill in the relevant fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] For more information, see [Create Contacts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md).  
        3. When you have completed the contact card, select the newly created contact in the list of contacts, and then choose the OK button to return to the sales quote.

        Several fields on the sales quote are now filled with information that you specified on the new contact card.

        > [!NOTE]
        > To correctly calculate taxes and prices for a quote, you must choose the relevant customer template in the **Customer Template Code** field. The template will be used to convert the contact to a customer once the quote is converted to a sales order or invoice.
    -  If the quote is for new customer, you must add the customer. For more information, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).  

3. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Quote** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    You're now ready to fill in the sales lines for products that you're selling or for any transaction with the customer or prospect that you want to record in a G/L account.  

    If you have set up recurring sales lines for the customer, such as a monthly replenishment order, then you can insert these lines on the order by choosing the **Get Recurring Sales Lines** action.  

4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select what type of product, charge, or transaction that you'll post for the customer with the sales line.
5. In the **No.** field, select a record to post according to the value in the **Type** field.

    You leave the **No.** field empty in the following cases:
    - If the line is for a comment. Write the comment in the **Description** field.
    - If the line is for a catalog item. Choose the **Select Catalog Items** action. For more information, see [Work With Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).

6. In the **Quantity** field, enter how many units of the product, charge, or transaction that the line will record for the customer.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the item is of type **Service**, or the **Type** field contains **Resource**, then the quantity is a time unit, such as hours, as indicated in the **Unit of Measure Code** field on the line. For more information, see [Set Up Item Units of Measure](inventory-how-setup-units-of-measure.md)

    The value in the **Line Amount** field is calculated as *Unit Price* x *Quantity*.  

    The price and line amounts are with or without sales tax, depending on what you selected in the **Prices Including Tax** field on the customer card.  
7. If you want to give a discount, enter a percentage in the **Line Discount %** field. The value in the **Line Amount** field updates accordingly.  

    If special item prices are set up on the **Sales Prices and Sales Line Discounts** FastTab on the customer or item card, the price and amount on the sales line automatically update if the price criteria is met. For more information, see [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).  
8. Repeat steps 4 through 7 for every product you want to offer the contact.

    The totals under the lines are automatically calculated as you create or modify lines.  
9. In the **Inv. Discount Amount** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field.

    If you have set up invoice discounts for the customer, then the specified percentage value is automatically inserted in the **Invoice Discount %** field if the criteria are met, and the related amount is inserted in the **Inv. Discount Amount Excl. Tax** field. For more information, see [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

    > [!TIP]
    > To have the **Quote Valid Until Date** filled in automatically with a certain number of days after quote creation, you can fill in the **Quote Validity Calculation** field on the **Sales & Receivables** page.

10. When the sales quote lines are completed, choose the **Send by Email** action.
11. On the **Send Email** page, fill in any remaining fields and review the embedded sales quote. For more information, see [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md#to-send-documents-by-email).
12. If the contact accepts the quote, choose the **Make Order** action.  

    Alternatively, if your organization prefers that process, choose the **Make Invoice** action.  
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you added a customer in step 2, you'll be asked to confirm the conversion of the quote to an order.  
    >
    > If you added a contact from a prospective customer in step 2, you'll be asked to take the following steps:
    >
    >  - Convert the contact or prospect to a customer by choosing one of contact conversion templates. For more information, see [To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact).  
    > - Confirm the conversion of the quote to an order.

The conversion removes the sales quote from the database. A sales invoice or a sales order is created based on the information in the sales quote so that you can process the sale. In the **Quote No.** field on the sales invoice or sales order, you can see the number of the sales quote that it was made from. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md) or [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

# Set Up Bin Types

You can direct the flow of items through bins that you have defined for particular warehouse activities. You give each bin its basic flow activities, and thereby define the way a bin is used, by assigning it a bin type.  

There are six types. You can operate your warehouse with all of the six possible bin types, or you can choose to operate with just the RECEIVE, PUTPICK, SHIP and QC bin types. These four bin types enable suggestions to be made that support the flow of items and allow you to record inventory discrepancies.  

## To set up the bin types you want to use

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bin Types**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Bin Types** page, create a 10-character code for a bin type.  
3.  Select the activities that can be performed with each bin type.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Bin types are only applicable if you are using directed put-away and pick for your location.  

The bin type determines only how a bin is used when processing the flow of items through the warehouse. You can always override the suggestions for any warehouse document, and you can move items in or out of any bin by performing a warehouse movement.  

The bin types that you can create are listed below.  

|Bin Type|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|RECEIVE|Items registered as posted receipts but not yet put away.|  
|SHIP|Items picked for warehouse shipment lines but not yet posted as shipped.|  
|PUT AWAY|Typically, items to be stored in large units of measure but that you do not want to access for picking purposes. Because these bins are not used for picking, either for production orders or shipments, your use of a Put Away type bin might be limited, but this bin type could be useful if you have purchased a large quantity of items. Bins of this type should always have a low bin-ranking, so that when received items are put away, other higher-ranking PUTPICK bins fixed to the item are put away first. If you are using this type of bin, you must regularly perform bin replenishment so that the items stored in these bins are also available in PUTPICK or PICK type bins.|  
|PICK|Items to be used only for picking, for example, for items with an approaching expiration date that you have moved into this type of bin. You would place a high bin ranking on these bins so they are suggested for picking first.|  
|PUTPICK|Items in bins that are suggested for both the put-away and pick functions. Bins of this type probably have different bin rankings. You can set up your bulk storage bins as this type of bin with low bin rankings compared to your ordinary pick bins or forward picking area bins.|  
|QC|This bin is used for inventory adjustments if you specify this bin on the location card in the **Adjustment Bin Code** field. You can also set up bins of this type for defective items and items being inspected. You can move items to this type of bin if you want to make them inaccessible to the usual item flow.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** Unlike all other bin types, the **QC** bin type has none of the item handling check boxes selected by default. This indicates that any content you place in a QC bin is excluded from item flows.|

# Sales by Customer (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Sales by Customer** report gives a clear picture of your organization's customers and their sales activities. It highlights key metrics for each customer, such as sales amount and quantities along with the costs associated. You can break down the metrics by the specific items that are sold per customer to identify key trends.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-customer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Customer Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-customer.png":::

## Use the report

This report is meant for all users to identify key customers and other customers that buy less than expected.

A COO can quickly identify a list of the top customers generating revenue for the company. You can easily identify which customers are generating the most revenue and how much each customer is contributing to your company's overall revenue. This information helps you make informed decisions and can provide valuable insights to the CFO regarding where the revenue is coming from.

A business development manager can quickly identify how you're attracting new customers to purchase from your organization. You can break down the metrics to find out how salespeople are performing. This information can then translate into what a sales manager would want to see, and enable them to track how sales are going for different salespeople.

For salespeople, the report you help can tailor your onsite visits to your customers based on their recent purchases. This report can also show you insights into specific period trends for this customer, and identify opportunities to up-sell or cross-sell.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)
- [**Sales Quantity**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-quantity)
- [**Cost Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount)
- [**Cost Amount Non-Inv**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount-non-inv)
- [**Gross Profit**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit)
- [**Gross Profit Margin**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit-margin)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Customer
- Item
- Value Entry
- Sales Line

# Control Access to Business Central Using Security Groups

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Security groups make it easier for administrators to manage user permissions. For example, for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, they're reusable across Dynamics 365 applications, such as SharePoint Online, CRM Online, and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Administrators add permissions to their [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] security groups, and when they add users to the group the permissions apply to all members. For example, an administrator can create a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] security group that gives salespeople the ability to create and post sales orders. Or, let purchasers do the same for purchase orders.

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes how to grant certain permissions to users based on their membership of a security group. To control whether users can access an environment based on their membership of a security group, see [Manage Access to Environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access).

## Business Central online and on-premises

You can use security groups for the online and on-premises versions of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Depending on your version, create groups in one of the following ways:

* For the online version, use Microsoft Entra security groups. To learn more about creating the group, go to [Create, edit, or delete a security group in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/email/create-edit-or-delete-a-security-group).
* For on-premises, security groups are only supported if the deployment is using Windows authentication. To create security groups for on-premises, use Windows Active Directory groups. To learn more, go to [Create a Group Account in Windows Active Directory](/windows/security/operating-system-security/network-security/windows-firewall/create-a-group-account-in-active-directory). 

Afterward, create a corresponding security group in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and then link it to the group you created. To learn more, go to [Add a security group in Business Central](#add-a-security-group-in-business-central).

> [!NOTE]
> If you've set up a special type of user with a Windows Group license type in a version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-prem that's earlier than 2023 release wave 1, when you upgrade [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] converts the user to a security group. The new security group has the same name as the Windows group name. The security group gives you a better overview of the group members and their effective permissions.

## Add a security group in Business Central

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Security Groups**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose **New** to create a group.
1. Create the link to your group, as follows:

    * For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, choose the group in the **Microsoft Entra security group name** field.
    * For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, choose the group in the **Windows group name** field.

> [!NOTE]
> The users show in the **Members** card on the FactBox pane or the **Security Group Members** page only if they're added as users in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about adding users, go to [To add users or update user information and license assignments in Business Central](ui-how-users-permissions.md#adduser).  

### Assign permissions to a security group

1. On the **Security Groups** page, choose the group, and then choose the **Permissions** action.
1. Assign permissions in the following ways:

    * To assign permission sets individually, in the **Permission Set** field, choose the permissions to assign.
    * To assign multiple permission sets, choose the **Add multiple** action, and then choose the sets to assign.
1. If you want the permission sets to apply only to a specific company, set the **Company** column to that company. If you want the permission set to apply to all companies, leave the **Company** column blank. [Learn more](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#control-access-to-specific-companies).

## Review the permissions in a security group

On the **Security Groups** page, the FactBox pane shows the **Permission Sets** that are assigned to the group. Each user listed in the **Members** card has those permissions. The **Permission Set by Security Group** action provides a more detailed view. There you can also explore the individual permissions in each security group.

Permissions are also available on the **Users** page. The FactBox pane shows the **Permission Sets from Security Group** and **Security Group Memberships** cards for the selected user.

## Security groups and user groups

> [!NOTE]
> User groups will no longer be available in a future release.

Security groups are very similar to the user groups that are currently available. However, user groups are only relevant for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Security groups are based on groups in Microsoft Entra ID or Windows Active Directory, depending on whether you're using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online or on-premises, respectively. Groups benefit administrators because they can use them with other Dynamics 365 apps. For example, if salespeople use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and SharePoint, administrators don't have to recreate the group and its members.

### Optional: Convert user groups to permission sets

In 2023 release wave 1 and later, you can convert user groups to permission sets in your tenant. The permission sets provide the same functionality as user groups. Here are some examples:

* You can use the **Users** FactBox to manage permissions for users.
* You can drill down on the permission set name to add other permission sets to the set you're working on. To learn more, go to [To add other permission sets](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#to-add-other-permission-sets).

Use the **User Group Migration** assisted setup guide to convert your groups. To start the guide, on the **Feature Management** page, find **Feature: Convert user group permissions**, and then choose **All Users** in the **Enabled For** field. The assisted setup guide offers the following options for the conversion.

|Option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Assign to user     | Assign the permissions in user groups directly to the users who were assigned to the group, and remove their user group assignments.        |
|Convert to a permission set     | Create a new permission for the permissions in each user group. The new permission set is assigned to all members of each user group.          |

### License configurations still apply

You can configure permissions in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on licenses. Those permissions are directly assigned to new users. These configurations still apply, even if you start using security groups.

To use security groups exclusively, we recommend that you remove the license configurations. To learn more about license configurations, go to [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).

You can remove license configurations on the **License Configuration** page. Choose a license, and then delete all permission sets assigned to it.

# The Image Analyzer Extension

The Image Analyzer extension uses powerful image analytics provided by the Computer Vision API for Azure Cognitive Services to detect attributes in the images that you import for items and contact persons, so you can easily review and assign them. For items, attributes could be whether the item is a table or a car, and whether it is red or blue. For contact persons, attributes can be gender or age.

Image Analyzer suggests attributes based on tags that the Computer Vision API finds, and a confidence level. By default, it suggests attributes only if it is at least 80% sure that the attribute is correct. You can set another confidence level, if needed. To learn more about how the tags and confidence level are determined, see [Computer Vision API](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=851476).  

Image Analyzer is free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], but there is a limit to the number of items that you can analyze during a certain period of time. By default, you can analyze 100 images per month.

After you enable the extension, Image Analyzer runs each time you import an image to an item or contact person. You will see the attributes, confidence level, and details right away, and can decide what to do with each attribute. If you imported images before you enabled the Image Analyzer extension, you must go to the item or contact cards and choose the **Analyze Picture** action.  

## Privacy notice

This extension uses the Computer Vision API from Azure Cognitive Services, which may have varying levels of compliance commitments than [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you enable the Image Analyzer extension, Customer Data such as a contact image or an item image will be sent to the Computer Vision API. By installing this extension, you agree for this limited set of data to be sent to the Computer Vision API. Note that you may disable, and uninstall, the Image Analyzer extension at any time to discontinue use of this functionality. For more information, see [Microsoft Trust Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=851463).

## Requirements

There are a few requirements for the images:

* Image formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP  
* Maximum file size: Less than 4 MB  
* Image dimensions: Greater than 50 x 50 pixels  

## Switch on the Image Analyzer extension

The Image Analyzer extension is built in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You just need to switch it on.

> [!NOTE]  
> To enable the Image Analyzer extension, you must be an administrator. Make sure that you are assigned the **SUPER** user permission set. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

To enable the Image Analyzer extension, take one of the following actions:

* Open an item or contact card. In the notification bar, choose **Analyze Picture**, then follow the steps in the assisted setup guide.  
* Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Connections**, and then choose **Image Analysis Setup**. Choose the **Enable Image Analyzer** check box, and then complete the steps in the assisted setup guide.  

    > [!TIP]  
    > The **Image Analysis Setup** page is also where you can change the degree of confidence for attribute suggestions. For example, if you want to require a greater degree of confidence, you can enter a higher percentage.

## Analyze an item image

The following steps describe how to analyze an image that was imported before you enabled the Image Analyzer extension.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the item, and then choose the **Analyze Picture** action.  
3. The **Image Analyzer Attributes** page displays the detected attributes, the confidence level, and other details about the attribute. Use the **Action to perform** options to specify what to do with the attribute or choose **Add to item description** to add the name of the attribute to the item description. For example, this action can be useful for quickly adding detail.

The **Action to perform** field has following options:

| Action | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| *Ignore* | No actions will be performed. |
| *Use as attribute* | The value is added to the item attributes. Learn more at [Work with Item Attributes](inventory-how-work-item-attributes.md). |
| *Use as a category* | The selected value is added as a category. Learn more at [Categorize Items](inventory-how-categorize-items.md). |
| *Add to blocklist* | If the analysis suggests an attribute that you do not want to see, you can block the attribute. Use caution, however. Blocked attributes are not suggested for other items either. If you regret blocking an attribute, choose **View Blocked Attributes**, and then delete the attribute from the list. |

> [!NOTE]  
> By default **Item Attributes** displays attributes where **Confidence Score** is above **Confidence Score Threshold %** defined in the **Image Analysis Setup**. To see all detected attributes, choose the **View All Attributes** action.

## Analyze a contact person picture

The following steps describe how to analyze an image that was imported before you enabled the Image Analyzer extension.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the contact person, and then choose the **Analyze Picture** action.  
3. On the **Profile Questionnaire** FastTab, review the suggestions, and make corrections if needed. Learn more at [Use Profile Questionnaires to Classify Business Contacts](marketing-create-contact-profile-questionnaire.md).  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >
    > The Computer Vision API returns following attributes:
    >
    > * *age*
    >
    >     An estimated "visual age" in years. It is how old a person looks as opposed to the actual biological age.
    > * *gender*
    >
    >    Male or female.
    >
    > The Computer Vision API doesn't return a confidence level for age and gender attributes.
  
## Use your own Computer Vision API account

You can also use your own account for the Computer Vision API, for example, if you want to analyze more images than the default integration offers.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Image Analysis Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter the **API URI** and **API Key** that you received for Computer Vision API.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You must add **/analyze** at the end of the API URI, if it isn't already there. For example: ```https://cronus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/analyze```.

## See how many analyses you have left in the current period

You can view the number of analyses you've done, and how many you can still do, in the current period.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Image Analysis Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. The **Limit Type**, **Limit Value**, and **Analyses Performed** fields provide the usage information.  

## Stop using the Image Analyzer extension

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Connections**, and then choose **Image Analysis Setup**.  
2. Clear the **Enable Image Analyzer** field.  

Alternatively, uninstall the extension completely. You can always fetch it again from AppSource. For more information, see [Installing and Uninstalling Extensions in Business Central](ui-extensions-install-uninstall.md#uninstall-an-app).

# Define Retention Policies

This article describes how administrators can define retention policies to specify how often to delete outdated data in tables that contain log entries and archived records. For example, cleaning up log entries can make it easier to work with the more relevant data. Policies can delete data based on an expiration date, or you can add filters to include only certain expired data.

## Required setups and permissions

Before you can create retention policies, you must set up the tables to include and the periods of time to keep data.

|Setup  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Allowed Tables**     |We provide a list of tables that you can include in retention policies. If you want to add tables from an extension to a retention policy, a developer must add their tables to the list. To learn more, go to [Include your extension in a retention policy](admin-data-retention-policies.md#include-your-extension-in-a-retention-policy-requires-help-from-a-developer).          |
|**Retention Periods**     |Specify periods of time for which to keep data in the tables in a policy. The periods determine how often data is deleted.         |

Additionally, you must have the **SUPER** user permissions or the **Retention Policy Setup** permission set. Users who have the Retention Policy Setup permission set can define retention policies for tables. That's true, even if they don't have Read and Delete permissions for the tables. The job queue entry must run as a user with permissions to read and delete the data. Don't grant the Retention Policy Setup permission set to users who shouldn't be allowed to delete data.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, and you want to try out retention policies in the the Cronus demonstration database, there are a few things you need to do. The demonstration company doesn't contain tables that you can use with retention policies, so you need to add them. To do that, create a new, blank company in the demonstration database. In the new company, import the RapidStart configuration package for your country/region that corresponds to the standard NAV17.0.W1.ENU.STANDARD.rapidstart package. The setup data for retention policies will be available in the new company.

### Create retention periods

Retention periods can be as long or as short as you want. To create retention periods, on the **Retention Policies** page, use the **Retention Period** action. The periods you define are available for all policies.

> [!NOTE]
> For compliance reasons, we have defined a minimum retention period for some tables. If you set a retention period that's shorter than minimum required, a message displays the mandatory period.

### Set up a retention policy

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Retention Policies**, and choose the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a new retention policy. 
3. In the **Table ID** field, choose the table that you want to include in the policy.
4. In the **Retention Period** field, specify the length of time for which to keep the data in the table.
5. Optional: You can apply the policy to specific data in a table, rather than all records, by filtering the data for each line. The policy will apply only to the records that the filters return. To specify the filter criteria, turn off the **Apply to all records** toggle. The **Record Retention Policy** FastTab displays, where you can set filter criteria. To learn more about how filters work, go to [Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#filtering).

   > [!NOTE]
   > Each line has its own retention period. If you specify different retention periods for the same data, the longest period is used. Also, some tables contain filters that you can't change or remove. To help you identify these filters, they appear in a lighter color font.

#### Video guidance

This video provides an example of how to set up a retention policy.

## Apply retention policies

You can use a job queue entry to apply retention policies to delete data automatically, or you can manually apply policies.

To apply a retention policy automatically, just create and enable a policy. When you enable a policy,, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a job queue entry that applies the it according to its retention period. All retention policies will use the same job queue entry. By default, the job queue entry applies the policy every day at 0200. You can change the default, but if you do we recommend that it runs outside business hours. To learn more, go to [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md). 

You can manually apply a policy by using the **Apply Manually** action on the **Retention Policies** page. If you want to always apply a policy manually, turn on the **Manual** toggle. The job queue entry will disregard the policy when it runs.

## View retention policy log entries

You can view activity related to retention policies in the **Retention Policy Log** page. For example, entries are created when a policy is applied, or if errors occurred.

## Include your extension in a retention policy (requires help from a developer)

By default, retention policies cover only [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the list we provide. You can remove default tables from the list, and you can add tables that you own. That is, you can't add a table that you did not create yourself. For example, you can't add other tables from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or from an extension that you have purchased.

To add your tables to the list of allowed tables, a developer must add some code. For example, to the installer codeunit for the extension (a codeunit with the *install* subtype).

When a developer adds a table, they can specify mandatory and default filters. Mandatory filters can't be removed or modified later when you add tables to define a retention policy. The default filters are just suggestions.

The following are examples of how to add a table to the list of allowed tables with, and without, mandatory or default filters. For a more complex example, go to codeunit 3999 "Reten. Pol. Install - BaseApp".

```al
 trigger OnInstallAppPerCompany()
    var
        RetenPolAllowedTables: Codeunit "Reten. Pol. Allowed Tables";
    begin
        RetenPolAllowedTables.AddAllowedTable(Database::"Retention Policy Log Entry");
    end;
```

The following example includes a mandatory filter.

```al
 trigger OnInstallAppPerCompany()
    var
        ChangeLogEntry: Record "Change Log Entry";
        RetenPolAllowedTables: Codeunit "Reten. Pol. Allowed Tables";
        RetentionPeriod: Enum "Retention Period Enum";
        RecRef: RecordRef;
        TableFilters: JsonArray;
        Enabled: Boolean;
        Mandatory: Boolean;
    begin
        ChangeLogEntry.Reset();
        ChangeLogEntry.SetFilter("Field Log Entry Feature", '%1|%2', ChangeLogEntry."Field Log Entry Feature"::"Monitor Sensitive Fields", ChangeLogEntry."Field Log Entry Feature"::All);
        RecRef.GetTable(ChangeLogEntry);
        Enabled := true;
        Mandatory := true;
        RetenPolAllowedTables.AddTableFilterToJsonArray(TableFilters, RetentionPeriod::"28 Days", ChangeLogEntry.FieldNo(SystemCreatedAt), Enabled, Mandatory, RecRef);
        RetenPolAllowedTables.AddAllowedTable(Database::"Change Log Entry", ChangeLogEntry.FieldNo(SystemCreatedAt), TableFilters);
    end;
```

After a developer has added tables to the list, an administrator can include them in a retention policy.

# Troubleshoot synchronization errors

There are lots of moving parts involved in integrating [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], and sometimes things go wrong. This article points out some of the typical errors that occur and gives some pointers for how to fix them.

Errors often occur either because of something that a user did to coupled records, or something is wrong with how the integration is set up. For errors related to coupled records, users can resolve them themselves. Causes for these errors are often actions, such as deleting data in one, but not both, business apps and then synchronizing. For more information, see [View the Status of a Synchronization](admin-how-to-view-synchronization-status.md).

Errors that are related to how the integration is set up typically require an administrator's attention. You can view these errors on the **Integration Synchronization Errors** page. 

The following table provides examples of typical issues:  

|Issue  |Resolution  |
|---------|---------|
|The permissions and roles assigned to the integration user aren't correct. | This error comes from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and it often includes the following text, **Principal user (Id=\<user id>, type=8) is missing \<privilegeName> privilege**. This error happens because the integration user is missing a privilege that allows it to access an entity. Typically, this error happens if you're synchronizing custom entities, or if you have an app installed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] that requires permission to access other [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entities. To resolve this error, assign the permission to the integration user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].<br><br> You can find the integration user name on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page. The error message provides the name of the permission, which can help you identify the entity for which you need permission. To add the missing privilege, sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with an administrator account and edit the security role assigned to the integration user. For more information, see [Create or edit a security role to manage access](/power-platform/admin/create-edit-security-role). |
|You're coupling a record that uses another record that isn't coupled. For example, a customer whose currency isn't coupled or an item for which the unit of measure isn't coupled. | You must first couple the dependent record, for example, a currency or unit of measure, and then retry the coupling. |
|Your connection to Dataverse paused during synchronization. For example, because your session timed out. When that happens, the following error displays when you resume your session: _Table connection for table type CRM must be registered using RegisterTableConnection or cmdlet New-NAVTableConnection before it can be used._|* For session timeouts, refresh the page to reconnect to Dataverse. The error message disappears.<br><br>* For an issue in the code, for example, if you're using a custom page to show data from a Dataverse entity, contact your Microsoft partner or support. When you do, use the **Copy details** action to share details about the error. |
|User does not have required privileges (or role membership) to access the org when it is in Admin Only mode.|You can set a sandbox, production, or trial (subscription-based) environment in administration mode so that only users with System Administrator or System Customizer security roles will be able to sign in to that environment. Administration mode is useful when you want to make operational changes and not have regular users affect your work, and not have your work affect end users (non-admins). 
Data synchronization doesn't work on Dataverse environments in Administration mode. Learn how to disable Administration mode in [Administration mode](/power-platform/admin/admin-mode#set-administration-mode).|

The following are some tools on the Integration Synchronization Errors page that can help you manually resolve these issues.  

* The **Source** and **Destination** fields can contain links to the row where the error was found. Choose the link to investigate the error.  
* The **Delete Entries Older than 7 Days** and the **Delete All Entries** actions clean up the list. Typically, you use these actions after you resolve the cause of an error that affects many records. Use caution, however. These actions might delete errors that are still relevant.
* The **Show Error Call Stack** action shows information that can help identify the cause of the error. If you can't resolve the error yourself and you decide to submit a support request, include the information in the support request.

# Create special orders

You can create a special order for a specific catalog item to be shipped to a specific customer. Your vendor ships the item to your warehouse and you can then ship the item on to your customer either independently or together with other items on another order.  

Special orders imply that the purchase and sales order are linked to ensure that the specific catalog item is picked and delivered to the customer.  

Before you can use this feature, you must first set up the customer, vendor, and item cards necessary for the order.  

## To create a special order

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. Create and fill in a  sales order for the item. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
3.  On the **Lines** FastTab, fill in the sales line. In the **Purchasing Code** field, select a purchasing code that has the **Special Order** field selected.

    You must now create a purchase order from a requisition worksheet.  
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Requisition Worksheets**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Choose the **Special Order** action, and then choose the **Get Sales Orders** action.  
6.  On the **Get Sales Orders** page, show results where the **Document No.** is the sales order number. Choose the **OK** button. A requisition worksheet line is created for the item.  
7.  On the requisition worksheet line, in the **Action Message** field, select **New**.  
8.  On the **Requisition Worksheets** page, choose the **Carry Out Action Message** action. The **Carry Out Action Msg. - Req.** page opens. Choose the **OK** button.  

    A message appears telling you that the purchase orders have been created. Choose the **OK** button.  

A purchase order created as a special order for a sales order is respected by the planning system as it balances demand and supply. That is, the purchase order (supply) remains linked to the sales order (demand), even if that purchase order could supply another earlier demand. For more information, see [Design Details: Reordering Policies](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot use the special order functionality if the item is already reserved. Therefore, for items that are sold on special orders, make sure the **Reserve** field on the item card is not set to **Always**.

# Create Service Quotes
You can think of service quotes as the basis for service orders. In fact, they are almost identical. They both contain information such as who the customer is, the type of order, the item that needs service, billing and shipping information, and information about the actual service work.

# Record and reimburse employees' expenses

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports transactions for employees in a similar way as for vendors. Accordingly, employee posting groups exist to make sure that employee ledger entries are posted to the relevant accounts in the general ledger.

> [!NOTE]  
> Reimbursement payments to employees do not support discounts and payment tolerances.

If employees spend their own money during business activities, you can post the expense to the employee's account. Then you can reimburse the employee by making a payment to the employee's bank account, similarly to how you pay vendors.  

This article explains how to record the expense in the books and how to reimburse the employee. Your organization might have a portal or app where employees can submit their expense reports.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is flexible enough to suit many different practices. The exact account numbers to use depend on your organization's configuration and processes.  

You can use general journals for employee accounts to register employee expenses and reimbursement transactions in foreign currencies, and then easily track the amounts and compare them to receipts. Leave your calculator in your desk drawer—Business Central can adjust the exchange rate for you. When you use general journals to post transactions for employee accounts, such as when you reimburse expenses, you can use the **Currency Code** field to specify the currency for the transactions. Specifying a currency lets you use the same features as when you register transactions in the customer and vendor ledgers. For example, employees can register an expense in euros but get paid in dollars.

To ensure that the exchange rate for the amounts is up to date, you can adjust employee balances when you run the currency exchange rate batch job. If you want to use the exchange rate table, but settle employee balances in your local currency, you can exclude employee accounts when you adjust exchange rates.

## To record an employee's expense

You post employees' expenses on the **General Journal** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant general journal batch. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).
3. On a new journal line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!INCLUDE[journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip](includes/journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip.md)]
4. Repeat step 3 for all the expenses that the employee has incurred.

    > [!TIP]  
    > If you want to enter multiple expense lines above one balance-account line for the employee's bank account, then select the **Suggest Balancing Amount** check box on the line for your batch on the **General Journal Batches** page. Then the **Amount** field on the balance-account line is automatically prefilled with the value that is required to balance the expenses.
5. Choose the **Post** action to record the expenses on the employee's account.

## To reimburse an employee

You reimburse employees by posting payments to their bank account on the **Payment Journal** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant payment journal batch. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. For more information, see [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).
4. Alternatively, choose the **Suggest Employee Payment** action to automatically insert journal lines for pending employee reimbursements.
5. Choose the **Post** action to register the reimbursement.  

## To reconcile reimbursements with employee ledger entries

You apply employee payments to their related open employee ledger entries in the same way as you do for vendor payments, for example on the **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page, based on the related bank statement entries. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md). Alternatively, you can apply manually on the **Employee Ledger Entries** page. For more information, see the related [Reconcile Vendor Payments with the Payment Journal or from Vendor Ledger Entries](payables-how-apply-purchase-transactions-manually.md).

# Manage user profiles

Assign all users to profiles that reflect:

* Their business role
* The department they work in
* Another type of categorization

Profiles allow administrators to centrally define and manage what different types of users can access in Business Central.

The typical business use of a profile is a role. A profile is therefore named *Profile (Role)* in the UI.

As an administrator, you create and manage profiles on the **Profiles (Roles)** page. Each profile has a card where you manage settings for the related role. The card contains the following information:

* Name of the role
* User settings
* The Role Center that the profile uses

For more information about user settings and Role Centers, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).

Before you can manage user profiles, you must create and add the users through the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. You can then assign permissions to each user or user group. Permissions define the features that users can access. For more information about permission settings, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

## Page customization

You can customize page layouts for a profile so that all users assigned the profile sees the customized pages. As an administrator, you customize pages by using the same functionality as users do when they personalize. For more information about customize page layouts, see [Customize Pages for Profiles](ui-personalization-manage.md).

## Create a profile

If you can't copy an existing profile, you can create a new one manually.

1. Select the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Profiles (Roles)**, and then select the related link.  
2. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> If you want a particular profile to be available only for very specific users, you can set the **Description** field to `Navigation menu only.`. This way, the profile is excluded from the list of available roles in **My Settings**.

## Copy a profile

To save time, you can create a new profile by copying an existing one. Copy one that has similar settings to the one you want to create.

When you copy a profile, all the involved page customizations are copied as well, both the user-created and those derived from extensions.

1. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the line for the profile that you want to copy, and then select the **Copy Profile** action.
2. Fill in the **Profile ID** and **Display Name** fields, and then select the **OK** button.
3. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, open the newly created profile card, and then edit other fields as necessary.

## Edit a profile

You can edit a profile by changing the fields on the **Profiles (Roles)** page. However, the changes aren't visible to the user assigned the profile until they sign out and back in.

> [!Caution]
> Do not rename a profile while users assigned the profile are signed in as users may experience that the product freezes and must be restarted.

## Assign a profile to a user

Users can assign themselves a role (representing a profile) by choosing the **Role** field on the **My Settings** page. As an administrator, you can do the same through the **Profiles (Roles)** page.

1. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the profile that you want to assign, and then select the **User Personalization List** action.
2. On the **User Settings** page, select the user that you want to assign the profile to, and then select the **Edit** action.
3. In the **Profile ID** field, select the relevant profile.

If you assign another profile to a user, any personalizations made by the user with the previous profile are preserved.

## Define user settings for a profile

On the **My Settings** page, users can define basic behavior of their account, such as the Role Center, the language, and which notifications they get. For more information about user settings, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).

As an administrator, you can define settings for a profile. The settings apply to all users assigned to the role.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Profiles (Roles)**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the line for the profile that you want to change user settings for, and then select the **User Personalizations List** action.
3. On the **User Personalizations** page, open the card for the user whose settings you want to change.
4. On the **User Personalization Card** page, edit the fields as necessary.

## Activate a profile

When you create a profile, you can define if, where, and how the profile and its information are available to users.

On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the following checkboxes:

* **Enabled** to specify if the related role is visible in the **Available Roles** page for users to choose from.  
* **Use as default profile** to specify the profile that applies to users who aren't assigned a specific role.
* **Disable personalization** to specify if users of the related role can personalize their workspace.
* **Show in Role Explorer** to specify if actions to business features included in the profile are shown in the extended view of the role explorer, a feature overview. For more information about role explorer, see [Finding Pages with the Role Explorer](ui-role-explorer.md).

## Export profiles

You can export profiles from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and reuse them in another tenant. The profiles are exported to a zip file that contains Application Language (AL) files. You can reuse the AL files to develop extensions. For more information about exporting profiles, see [Use the Client to Create Profiles and Page Customizations](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-design-profiles-using-client).

* On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the **Export Profiles** action.

    This action exports a zip file that contains AL files for all profiles.

## Import profiles

You can import profiles that are exported from Business Central. The steps are more or less the opposite of the steps to export profiles.

1. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the **Import Profiles** action.
1. Follow the steps on the **Import Profiles** wizard.

    If you only want to import selected profiles, use the **Selected** checkbox to indicate which to import.
1. Select the **Import Selected** button.

    This action imports a zip file that contains AL files for the selected profiles.

## Delete a profile

You can delete a profile by choosing the **Delete** action on the **Profiles (Roles)** page. However, the following limitations apply:

* You can't delete a profile that is assigned to a user or a user group.
* You can't delete profiles that originate from extensions. The extension must first be uninstalled.
* You can only delete one profile at a time.

## Delete personalizations

### Delete all personalizations made by a specific user

You can delete all changes that a user makes to any pages, which reverts the pages to the the original layout. Personalizations aren't associated with a profile (role). If a user personalizes a page, then they experience the personalizations on the page no matter which role they are using.<!--Deleting changes can be useful, for example, if an employee changes role and no longer needs them. The profile defines the page layout and deletions restore it back to that definition.--> 

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Settings**, and then select the related link.

    The **User Settings** page lists all users<!--who make personalizations-->.

2. Select the user whose personalizations you want to delete.
3. On the **User Settings** card page, select the **Clear Personalized Pages** action, and then accept the message that appears.

The user sees the changes the next time they sign in.

You can also delete all page customizations for a profile. For more information, see [To delete all customizations for a profile](ui-personalization-manage.md#delete-all-customizations-for-a-profile).

### Delete personalizations for specific pages

You can delete personalizations that one or more users make to specific pages. Deleting personalizations can be useful, for example, if a business process change means that a personalization can't be used. Deletions restore the page layout back to what the profile defines.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Personalized Pages**, and then select the related link.

    The **Personalized Pages** page lists all the pages that are personalized and the user that they belong to.

    <!--A checkmark in the **Legacy Personalization** field indicates that the personalization was done in an older version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], which handled personalization differently. Users who try to personalize these pages are locked from doing so unless they choose to unlock the page.-->

2. Select the line for the page personalization that you want to delete, and then select the **Delete** action.

The user will see the changes the next time they sign-in.  

You can also delete individual page customizations for a profile. For more information, see [To delete customization for specific pages for a profile](ui-personalization-manage.md#delete-customization-for-specific-pages-for-a-profile).

## Managing user sessions

As the administrator of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can manage user sessions in the administration center. For more information, see [Managing Sessions][def] in the administration content.  

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you can manage sessions using SQL Server Management Studio, for example. For more information, see [SQL Server technical documentation](/sql/sql-server).

# Power BI FAQ

This article answers some of the questions you might have about working with Power BI and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

<!-- ## [General questions](#tab/general) -->
## General questions

<!-- 26 -->
### I selected a report for my role center in Business Central. If I later make changes to the report's visuals online, does the role center automatically update to my changes?

Yes. The reports you see inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are embedded directly from Power BI, and not a copy.

<!-- 3 -->
### Are the Business Central apps for Power BI available in languages other than English?

No. These apps are currently only available in English.

<!-- 24 -->
### Once a report is published on my powerbi.com workspace, can I download its pbix? 

Yes. Learn more at [Download a report from the Power BI service to Power BI Desktop](/power-bi/create-reports/service-export-to-pbix).  

<!-- 27 -->
### Can I download the apps as pbix files?

No. Currently, we don’t offer downloading pbix files for the official Power BI apps, because they're published on AppSource.

<!-- ## [User access and licensing](#tab/license) -->
## Questions about user access and licensing


<!-- 14 -->
### Do I need a Power BI Pro license to publish reports?

<!-- todo What does " or for every user that consults the published report" mean? fixed -->
No. A Pro license isn't needed to publish reports. The standard (free) Power BI license is enough. Learn more in [Power BI Licensing](admin-powerbi-setup.md#license).

<!-- 15 -->
### Is there anything I can't do with the free license?

You can't share reports or install the Business Central apps for Power BI. The free license allows you to create almost all variations of charts and reports.

<!-- 16 -->
### If someone shares a report with another person, then that person needs a Pro license to see the report. Are there plans to make this capability possible with the free license?

We don't have control over this requirement. Power BI sets this requirement. Learn more at [Share Power BI dashboards and reports with coworkers and others](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards).  

### How do guest users and delegated admins access my organization's data and reports?

There are some differences and limitations for external users, like guest users and delegated admins. For instance, external users typically have a Power BI license assigned by their own organization. When they sign in to Power BI or Power BI Desktop, they connect to their organization's tenant and shared workspaces by default.

To access your organization's data and shared workspaces or reports, external users must connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant. From Power BI service, they can use the tenant switcher (preview) to connect. Power BI Desktop doesn't support connecting to a provider tenant's data source or service for creating and publishing reports. External users need to use the Power BI service to upload Power BI Desktop files.

<!--
1. Sign in to [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com).
1. In the upper-right corner, select the profile picture to open the account manager, and then select **Switch** next to **Tenant name**.
1. In the **Switch tenant (preview)** dialog, open the dropdown menu and choose the tenant.-->

Learn more about the features and limitations for guests users in [Distribute Power BI content to external guest users](/power-bi/enterprise/service-admin-azure-ad-b2b).
<!--
To access and design reports with your organization's data, external users must connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant. The connection method differs in Power BI service and Power BI Desktop.

#### In Power BI service
From the Power BI service, use the tenant switcher:

1. Sign in to [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com).
1. Select your profile picture to open your account manager and select **Switch** next to **Tenant name**.
1. In the **Switch tenant (preview)** dialog, open the dropdown menu and choose the tenant you want to navigate to.

Learn more in [Distribute Power BI content to external guest users](/power-bi/enterprise/service-admin-azure-ad-b2b#tenant-switcher).

#### In Power BI Desktop

The methods in this section require that guest users know the domain name of your Microsoft 365 tenant, such as `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`.

> [!NOTE]
> The methods described in this section aren't supported. You might experience unexpected behavior.

##### Creating and refreshing reports: Change data source to host's Business Central tenant

1. Clear the current data source connection. Learn more in [How do I change or clear the user account I'm currently using to connect to Business Central from Power BI Desktop](#how-do-i-change-or-clear-the-user-account-im-currently-using-to-connect-to-business-central-from-power-bi-desktop).
1. Select **Get Data**.
1. On the **Get Data** page, select **Online Services** > **Dynamics 365 Business Central** > **Connect**.
1. On the **Dynamics Business Central** connector dialog box, select **Sign in** and then follow the instructions to [sign in to the host's organization](#sign-in-to-hosts-organization).

##### Sign in to host's organization

1. On the **Pick an account** dialog box, select **Use another account**.
1. On the **Sign in** dialog box, select **Sign-in options**.
1. On the **Sign in options** dialog box, select **Sign in to an organization**.
1. On the **Find your organization** dialog box, enter the domain name of the tenant, for example, `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`.
1. Select **Next**.
1. On the **Pick an account** dialog box, select your account, and then sign in usual.
1. On the **Dynamics Business Central** connector dialog, select **Connect**.-->

<!-- ## [Designer](#tab/designer) -->
## Questions about the Power BI Designer

<!-- 7 -->
### Does the connector work with pages exposed as web services?

Web services are an old technology and aren't recommended to use with Power BI. The Power BI connector supports both Business Central web services and API pages, but API pages generally have better performances and are more suited for making data available to other systems. Learn more at [Enable Power BI connector to work with Business Central APIs, instead of with web services only](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/enable-power-bi-connector-work-business-central-apis-instead-web-services-only).

### Can I build a Power BI report using the Sales Invoice Lines or Journal Lines APIs?

The most commonly used line records are available in the [Business Central APIs v2.0](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/)). So you can use them to build reports in Power BI by selecting them in the **Dynamics 365 Business Central** connector. However, the **Lines** APIs are designed for use with specific filters only, and might not work in your scenario. You might get an error similar to "You must specify an ID or a Document ID to get the lines." To fix this problem, do the following steps when getting data from Business Central for the report in Power BI Desktop:

1. Instead of including the data source for the lines entity, add the parent data source. For example, add **Sales Invoice** instead of **Sales Invoice Lines**.
2. Select **Transform Data** in the Power BI Desktop action bar.
3. Select the query you just added, for example **Sales Invoices**.
4. To reduce the number of records loaded in your report, apply any needed filtering on the records.
5. Scroll vertically until you find a column named as the lines, for example **SalesInvoiceLines**.
6. Select the expand button in the header of the column, next to the column name.

   :::image type="content" source="media/saleinvoicelines.png" alt-text="Shows the SalesInvoiceLines column in Power BI Desktop.":::
<!-- 11 --> 
### Is it possible to choose which Business Central environment to get data from for Power BI, for example, like a sandbox or production environment? 

Yes. It can be easily chosen. When you connect to Business Central using the connector, you have to choose the environment and company name.

<!-- 6 --> 
### Can I merge data from several production environments of the same tenant?

Yes. In Power BI, just run the "get data" operation again and choose the environment you want.

<!-- 25 -->
### Which pages in Business Central have the Power BI Report part?  

Currently, there are a few selected pages that have a FactBox with a **Power BI Reports** part for displaying a report. 

On list pages, the **Power BI Reports** part is filtered to show reports that pertain to data in the list. Here's the list type pages that include the **Power BI Reports** part:

|Page ID|Name|
|-------|----|
|22|Customer List|
|27|Vendor List|
|31|Item List|
|9305|Sales Order List|
|9308|Purchase Invoices|

Here are other pages that contain the larger, nonfiltered **Power BI Reports** part:

|Page ID|Name|
|-------|----|
|1156|Company Detail|
|4013|Intelligent Cloud Insights |
|9006|Order Processor Role Center|
|9008|Whse. Basic Role Center|
|9010|Production Planner Role Center|
|9015|Job Project Manager RC|
|9016|Service Dispatcher Role Center|
|9022|Business Manager Role Center|
|9024|Security Admin Role Center|
|9026|Sales & Relationship Mgr. RC|
|9027|Accountant Role Center|

> [!TIP]
> We don't have plans to add it to all list pages at the moment. However, you can create a simple page extension that adds the **Power BI Reports** part in a FactBox. Learn more at [Adding Power BI Report Parts to Pages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-power-bi-report-parts) in the Developer and IT Pro help.

<!-- 5 -->
### Is there any way to filter a dataset from Business Central *before* I pull it into Power BI, instead of applying filters afterwards?

To filter larger datasets, the easiest way is to set a filter on your Power BI report by editing directly the Power Query formula. Most of the filters you set this way are passed on to Business Central through query folding. See [Incremental refresh for datasets](/power-bi/admin/service-premium-incremental-refresh).

There's currently no way of setting a filter for the web service data from within Business Central. If your application needs to set a filter from within Business Central, you must create a custom Business Central App for this purpose.

<!-- 10 -->
### From Power BI, besides using a query, is there another way to get data from Business Central tables that don't have an associated page? For example, like the *Item Attributes Value Mapping* table.

No. Not at this point.

<!-- 12 --> 
### Are published queries faster to use than published pages?

When it comes to web services, published queries are usually faster than equivalent published pages. The reason is that queries are optimized for reading data and don’t contain expensive triggers like OnAfterGetRecord.

Web services are based on pages or queries that are built for access from the web and not optimized for access from external services. Even though the Business Central connector still supports getting data from web services, we encourage you to use API pages instead of web services whenever possible.

<!-- 13 --> 
### Is there a way for an end user to create a web service with a column that's in a Business Central table, but not a page? Or does the developer have to create a custom query? 

There's currently no way of adding a new field to a web service. API pages offer full flexibility on the page structure, so a developer can create a new API page to meet this requirement. 

<!-- 28 --> 
### Can I connect Power BI to a read-only database server of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online? 

By default, the Power BI connector reads data from a read-only replica of the Business Central database, which is the case for all reports created after February 2022. This behavior causes your reports to refresh faster and has less impact on performance if you're using Business Central while a report is refreshing. We still recommend that you schedule your reports to refresh outside of normal working hours whenever possible.

If you have old reports based on Business Central data, they don't connect to the read-only database replica. In this case, consider recreating the query inside Power BI so that it uses the latest defaults.

### <a name="databasemods"></a>When I use the Power BI connector to connect to my custom [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] API page, I get the error "Cannot insert a record. Current connection intent is Read-Only." How can I fix it?

Reports that use Business Central data connect to a read-only replica of the Business Central database by default. In rare cases, this behavior might cause the error "Current connection intent is Read-Only.". This error typically happens because your custom API is making modifications to Business Central records while Power BI tries to get the data. In particular, it happens as part of the AL triggers: OnInit, OnOpenPage, OnFindRecord, OnNextRecord, OnAfterGetRecord, and OnAfterGetCurrRecord.

To fix this issue by forcing the Business Central connector to allow this behavior, see [Building Power BI Reports to Display Business Central Data - Fixing Problems](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md#fixing-problems).

<!--
In general, we recommend avoiding any database modifications in API pages when they're opening or loading records, because they cause performance issues and might cause your report refresh to fail. In some cases, you might still need to make a database modification when your custom API page opens or loads records. You can force the Business Central connector to allow this behavior. Do the following steps when getting data from Business Central for the report in Power BI Desktop:

1. Start Power BI Desktop.
2. In the ribbon, select **Get Data** > **Online Services**.
3. In the **Online Services** pane, select **Dynamics 365 Business Central**, then **Connect**.
4. In the **Navigator** window, select the API endpoint that you want to load data from.
5. In the preview pane on the right, you'll see the following error:

   *Dynamics365BusinessCentral: Request failed: The remote server returned an error: (400) Bad Request. (Cannot insert a record. Current connection intent is Read-Only. CorrelationId: [...])".*

6.	Select **Transform Data** instead of **Load** as you might normally do.
7. In **Power Query Editor**, select **Advanced Editor** from the ribbon.
8.	Replace the following line:

   ```
   Source = Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions(null, null, null, null),
   ```

   with the line:

   ```
   Source = Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions(null, null, null, [UseReadOnlyReplica = false]),
   ```

9.	Select **Done**.
10. Select **Close & Apply** from the ribbon to save the changes and close Power Query Editor.

-->
### <a name="perms"></a>How do I change or clear the user account I'm currently using to connect to Business Central from Power BI Desktop?

In Power BI Desktop, do the following steps:

1. In the File menu, select **Options and settings** > **Data source settings**.
2. Select **Dynamics Business Central** from the list, then select **Clear permissions** > **Delete**.

Then next time you connect to Business Central to get data, you'll be asked to sign in.


<!-- ## [Performance](#tab/performance) -->
## Questions about data refresh performance

<!-- 17 -->

### Is it faster to get data using API pages than using web services?

Yes. Our tests indicate that API pages are up to 25% more performant than web services.

<!-- 18 -->
### Are there plans to have a mirror on the Azure SQL Database instance, which I can connect to directly?

No. Not at this point. You can only communicate with Business Central through APIs.

<!-- 19 -->
### Loading data from Business Central web services seems slow. Is there any way to get data directly from the SQL database table?

No. Direct access to the database isn't possible, but switching to API pages helps greatly.

## Troubleshooting questions

### My semantic model does not refresh. How do I see what is wrong?

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-refresh-tsg-include](includes/powerbi-refresh-tsg-include.md)]

<!-- ## [Advanced](#tab/advanced) -->
## Advanced questions
<!-- 1 -->

### Are there plans for the Power BI connector to support the incremental refresh features in the Power BI Service?

Yes. It's on our roadmap.

<!-- 2 -->
### If a Business Central on-premises solution doesn't have internet access, can I still use Power BI?
<!-- todo: please explain this one-->

Yes. In this case, you use Power BI Desktop locally and connect to the Business Central on-premises. Once connected, can create and view reports, but you just can't publish them to the Power BI Service. 
<!-- 20 -->
### Are there any plans to make it possible to replicate Business Central online databases so they're accessible for read-only SQL queries? This capability would support incremental refresh and be a lot faster than APIs or web services.

<!-- todo: what does "BC-Saas-DB-replicated DB accessible" mean? fixe-->
Yes. We have this feature on our long-term roadmap. 

<!-- 21 -->
### If I use Azure Data Factory to get data from Business Central and consume it on Power BI, does that help in increase in performance? 

Yes. This advanced scenario helps Business Central stay performant, because the data access would be done via the Azure Data Factory.

<!-- 22 -->
### Are there any plans to support Power BI deployment pipelines or a way to build deployment pipelines for PBI reports, similar to extensions? Or maybe even a simple API in the Business Admin Center? 

We're looking into this feature. Power BI offers rich APIs to control report deployments. Learn more at [Introduction to deployment pipelines](/power-bi/create-reports/deployment-pipelines-overview).

### When I get data from Business Central to use in my Power BI reports, I see some values like "_x0020_". What are these values?

Some API pages, including most API v2.0 pages, have fields based on [AL Enum objects](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-extensible-enums). Fields based on AL enum objects must have names that are consistent and always the same, so that filters on the report always work&mdash;no matter the language or operating system you're using. For this reason, the fields based on AL enums aren't translated and are encoded to avoid any special character, including the space. In particular, whenever there's an empty option in the AL Enum object, it's encoded to "_x0020_". You can always apply a transformation to your data on Power BI if you want to display some different value for these fields, for example "Empty".

# Gross Requirement (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Gross Requirement** report looks at all outbound transactions to determine the quantity required per item.

The report shows the gross requirement for an item and the different documents that include it. This information is coupled with the **Project Available Balance** that calculates the balance at any point in time.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/gross-requirement.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Gross Requirement Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/gross-requirement.png":::

## Use the report

The report helps management and procurement officers to determine whether the organization is keeping up with demand.

Managers can use the report to ensure that stock levels are high enough to maintain the production schedule and sales demand for each item. The report helps identify bottlenecks in production by showing items where the available inventory doesn't meet the gross requirement.

Procurement officers can view sales and production volumes and ensure your available balance meets the requirements for each item. With this information, you can make informed decisions on the items you should replenish.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Gross Requirement* report includes the following KPIs:

- [**Gross Requirement**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#gross-requirement)
- [**Project Available Balance**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#projected-available-balance)
- [**Qty. on Sales Order**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#qty-on-sales-order)

title: Reconcile inventory costs with the general ledger

# Reconcile inventory costs with the general ledger

When you post inventory transactions, such as sales shipments, purchase invoices, or inventory adjustments, the changed item costs are recorded in item value entries. To reflect this change of inventory value in your financial books, the inventory costs also need to be posted to the related inventory accounts in the general ledger, such as the inventory account, adjustment account, and COGS account in the general ledger.

Unless you have selected the **Automatic Cost Posting** check box in the **Inventory Setup** window, inventory costs aren't recorded dynamically in the general ledger, and COGS isn't calculated with a sale. Therefore, you must post to the general ledger manually by running the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job to update the general ledger and potentially print a report of the value entries that are posted.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before you use this batch job, you should run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. This ensures that, when you run this batch job, the costs that will be posted to the general ledger are up to date. This is referred to as cost adjustment. For more information, see [Adjust Item Costs](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md).

## To post inventory costs manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**, and then choose the related link.

2. Post inventory costs to the general ledger manually by running the batch job. When you run this batch job, general ledger entries are created on the basis of value entries. To calculate the value to post, it uses the difference between the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field and the **Cost Posted to G/L** field in the value entries. If you have selected the **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** checkbox on the **Inventory Setup** page, the batch job also posts the difference between the **Cost Amount (Expected)** field and the **Exp. Cost Posted to G/L** field to interim accounts in the general ledger. You can post the entries so that they are summarized per posting group.

|Option  |Description  |
|--------------|---------|
|**Posting Method**|The batch job can either post inventory value to the general ledger per posting group or per posted entry. If you post per entry, you achieve a detailed specification of how the inventory affects the general ledger, but you also get numerous G/L entries. If you post per posting group, the batch job creates a general ledger entry per posting date per posting group combination. This means that a general ledger entry is created for each combination of posting date, general business posting group, general product posting group, inventory posting group, and location code. In addition, the batch job creates separate general ledger entries for costs with different signs.|
|**Document No.**|In this field, you can enter a document number if you have chosen the *Post per Inventory Posting Group* option. The document number appears on posted entries.|
|**Post**|Select this field if you want the batch job to post to the general ledger automatically. If you don't choose to post the inventory cost to G/L, the batch job will only print a test report showing the values that can be posted to the general ledger, and on the report will appear: **Test Report (not posted)**.|

> [!NOTE]  
> When you run this batch job, you might encounter errors having to do with missing setup or incompatible dimension setup. If the batch job encounters errors in the dimension setup, it overrides these errors and uses the dimensions of the value entry. For any other errors, the batch job skips posting the value entries and lists them at the end of the report in a section titled “Skipped Entries.” To post these entries, you must fix the errors.
> For example if you have not selected the **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** check box in the **Inventory Setup** window, then the last section of the report will list value entries that are skipped because they represent expected costs.

To see a list of errors before running the posting batch job, you can run the **Post Invt. Cost to G/L - Test** report. The test report lists all the errors encountered during a test posting. You can then fix the errors, and run the inventory cost posting batch job without skipping any entries.

If you would like to get an overview of what values could be posted to the general ledger without actually performing the posting, you can run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job without actually posting the values to the general ledger. You do this by clearing the check mark from the **Post** field on the request page. This way, when you run the batch job, the report is produced showing the values that are ready to be posted to the general ledger, but they aren't posted.

## To audit the reconciliation between the inventory ledger and the general ledger

The **Inventory - G/L Reconciliation** page provides the following:

- Exposes reconciliation differences by comparing what is recorded in G/L and what is recorded in the inventory ledger (value entries).
- Displays unreconciled cost amounts in the value entries in the inventory ledger as if they were mapped to corresponding inventory-related accounts in G/L and compares those to the totals recorded in the same accounts in G/L.
- Reflects the double entry structure of G/L by visually presenting data as such. For example, a COGS entry has a corresponding inventory entry.
- Lets users drill down and see the entries that make up the cost amounts.
- Includes filters to narrow the analysis by date, item, and location.
- Explains reasons for reconciliation differences in informative messages.


The **Name** column on the far left in the grid lists the various G/L account types that are associated with inventory.

The **Inventory**, **Inventory (Interim)**, and **WIP Inventory** columns show the invoiced, non-invoiced, and WIP totals of each G/L account type. These are calculated from value entries, that is, they're projected onto the G/L account types where they'll end when they're eventually posted to G/L.

The **Total** column shows the sum (in bold font) of the value entry amounts in the three inventory columns.

The **G/L Total** column shows the amounts (in bold font) for each G/L account type that exists in G/L. These are calculated from G/L entries, that is, they represent inventory costs already posted to G/L.

The **Difference** column represents the difference between the value in the **G/L Total** and **Total** fields.

In the top of the **Inventory - G/L Reconciliation** page, you can enter filters to limit, for example, the period of time for which you want information.

If you select the **Show Warning** check box and if there are any discrepancies between the inventory totals and G/L totals, application shows messages in the **Warning** field of the grid that explain the discrepancy. If you choose the Warning field, application gives you more information on what the warning means.

When you have entered all relevant filters, choose the **Show Matrix** action. The data is calculated and the matrix page appears.

On the far left column in the grid, you see the various general ledger account types that are associated with inventory. The grid then shows the invoiced, non-invoiced (interim), and WIP inventory totals for each of these account types. These totals are calculated from the value entries.

The next columns show the totals for the same account types calculated from the general ledger entries.

Choose the  amount in any of the total fields to see the inventory report entries that were used to calculate the totals. For inventory totals, the inventory report entries are the sums of the value entries for the items. For the G/L totals, the inventory report entries are the sums from the general ledger entries.

## Reporting Costs and Reconciling with the General Ledger
Other reports, tracing functions, and a special reconciliation tool are available to the auditor or controller responsible for reporting a correct and balanced inventory value to the finance department.

The following table describes them.    

|**To**|**See**|  
|------------|-------------|  
|View the inventory value of selected items, including information about the quantities and values of increases and decreases in inventory over a selected period.|**Inventory Valuation** report|  
|View the inventory value of selected production orders in your WIP (work in process) inventory, such as the quantities and values of consumption, capacity usage, and output in ongoing production orders.|**Inventory Valuation - WIP** report|  
|View the inventory value of selected items, including their actual and expected cost on the date specified.|**Invt. Valuation - Cost Spec.** report|  
|Use a report to analyze the reasons for cost variances or to gain insight into the cost shares of sold items (COGS).|**Cost Shares Breakdown** report|

# The Basic Experience extension

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

If you have been using Microsoft Dynamics C5, Microsoft partners can help you transition to a more modern solution that is based on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], so you can continue to enjoy the same streamlined capabilities as Dynamics C5.

This extension is intended for small businesses and can support up to three users. If you need more users, you must upgrade to a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license and uninstall this extension.

> [!NOTE]
> As of now, this extension is available only to customers in Denmark and Iceland.

## What's available

The following table describes the capabilities that are available if you install the Basic Experience extension.

|Area  |Functionality  |
|---------|---------|
|**General Ledger** |Basic finance, financial reports, fixed assets, bank management, bank reconciliation, payments, direct debit, dimensions, multiple currencies, budgets, workflow, document management/OCR, consolidation, unlimited companies|
|**Accounts Receivable/Sales** |Basic receivables, sales invoicing, sales discounts, pricing, sales tax, contact management |
|**Accounts Payable/Purchase** |Basic payables, purchase invoicing |
|**Project Management** |Jobs, job pricing, time sheets, assignments, tasks, resources |
|**Inventory** |Basic inventory, item substitutions, item cross reference |

## Getting started

This extension is a bit different than most, and you'll need help from a Microsoft partner to install and set it up. So that you know what to expect, here's a high-level view of what the Microsoft partner does.

1. Create a new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant. This can be either a trial or a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) version.
2. Add at least one user who is assigned to a Basic Experience license in your Microsoft Entra account.
3. Remove all companies, including the sample Cronus company.
4. Create a new company that doesn't contain any sample data or setups.
5. Add the **Demo RapidStart** package. <!--what does the package contain?-->
6. Download and install the Basic Experience extension from AppSource.

## Migrating data

Bring your Dynamics C5 data along. After your Microsoft partner installs the Basic Experience extension, you'll have an empty company. An easy way to move your data from Dynamics C5 to Basic Experience is to use the C5 Data Migration extension, which is included in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The extension migrates customers, vendors, items, and your general ledger accounts and their entries.

# Design Details: Item Tracking
As the flow of goods in today's supply chain becomes more and more complex, the ability to keep track of items is increasingly important to the companies involved. Monitoring an item's transaction flow is a legal requirement in the business of medical and chemical supply, but other businesses may want to monitor products with warranties or expiration dates for customer service reasons.  

An item tracking system should provide a company with easy handling of serial and lot numbers, considering each unique piece of merchandise: when and where received, where stored, when and where sold. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has gradually expanded its coverage of this business requirement and today provides application-wide functionality and a solid core on which to develop extensions.

# Process purchase returns or cancellations

If you want to return items to your vendor or cancel services that you have purchased, then you can create and post a purchase credit memo that specifies the requested change with regard to the original purchase invoice. To include the correct purchase invoice information, you can create the purchase credit memo directly from the posted purchase invoice or you can create a new purchase credit memo with copied invoice information.

If you need more control of the purchase return process, such as warehouse documents for the item handling or better overview when shipping back items from multiple purchase documents with one purchase return, then you can create purchase return orders. A purchase return order automatically issues the related purchase credit memo. For more information, see [To create a purchase return order based on one or more a posted purchase documents](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-purchase-credit-memo-from-a-posted-purchase-invoice).

> [!NOTE]  
> If a posted purchase invoice has not yet been paid, then you can use the **Correct** or **Cancel** functions on the posted purchase invoice to automatically reverse the involved transactions. These functions only work for unpaid invoices, and they do not support partial returns or cancellations. You can also not correct or cancel purchase invoices that were posted with with receipts from more than one purchase order. For more information, see [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-correct-cancel-unpaid-purchase-invoices.md).

Typically, you create a purchase credit memo or purchase return order in reaction to a credit memo sent to you by a vendor. The purchase credit memo or purchase return order functions as your internal documentation of the credit memo process for accounting purposes or to control the shipping of the involved items.

The change might relate to all the products on the original purchase invoice or only to some of the products. Accordingly, you can partially return received items or demand partial reimbursement of received services. In that case, you must edit the information on the purchase credit memo or purchase return order.

In addition to the original posted purchase invoice, you can apply the purchase credit memo or purchase return order to other purchase documents, for example another posted purchase invoice because you're also returning items delivered with that invoice.

The credit memo posting will also revert any item charges that were assigned to the posted document, so that the item's value entries are the same as before the item charge was assigned.

## Inventory costing
To preserve correct inventory valuation, you typically want to pick return items from inventory at the unit cost that they were purchased at, not at their current unit cost. This is referred to as exact cost reversing.

Two functions exist to assign exact cost reversing automatically.  

|Function|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function on the **Purchase Return Order** page|Copies lines of one or more posted documents to be reversed into the purchase return order. For more information, see [To create a purchase return order based on one or more posted purchase documents](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-purchase-return-order-based-on-one-or-more-posted-purchase-documents).|  
|**Copy from Document** function in the **Purchase Credit Memo** and **Purchase Return Order** pages|Copies both the header and lines of one posted document to be reversed.<br /><br /> Requires that the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** check box is selected on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page.|

To assign exact cost reversing manually, you must choose the **Appl.-from Item Entry** field on any type of return document line, and then select the number of the original purchase entry. This links the purchase credit memo or purchase return order to the original purchase sales entry and ensures that the item is valued at the original unit cost.

For more information, see [Design Details: Inventory Costing](design-details-inventory-costing.md).

## To create a purchase credit memo from a posted purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Posted Purchase Invoices** page, select the posted purchase invoice that you want to reverse, and then choose the **Create Corrective Credit Memo** action.

    Most fields on the purchase credit memo header are filled with the information from the posted purchase invoice. You can edit all the fields, for example with new information that reflects the return agreement.
3. Edit information on the lines according to the agreement, such as the number of items returned or the amount to be reimbursement.
4. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
5. On the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, select the line with the posted purchase document that you want to apply the purchase credit memo to, and then choose the **Applies-to ID** action. The number of the purchase credit memo is inserted in the **Applies-to ID** field.
6. In the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount that you want to apply if smaller than the original amount.

    At the bottom of the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, you can see the total amount to apply to reverse all involved entries, namely when the value in the **Balance** field is zero.
7. Choose the **OK** button. When you post the purchase credit memo, it will be applied to the specified posted purchase documents.

    When you have created or edited the needed purchase credit memo lines and the single or multiple applications are specified, you can proceed to post the purchase credit memo.
8. Choose the **Post** action.

The posted purchase invoices that you apply the credit memo to are now reversed. If you have already paid the original invoice, the vendor should now refund the payment to you. If the credit memo is only for part of the product on the original invoice, you might only pay the remaining amount on the original purchase invoice to close it.

The purchase credit memo is removed and replaced with a new document in the list of posted purchase credit memos.

## To create a purchase credit memo by copying a posted purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty purchase credit memo.
3. In the **Vendor** field, enter the name of an existing vendor.
4. Choose the **Copy from Document** action.
5. On the **Copy Purchase Document** page, in the **Document Type** field, select **Posted Invoice**.
6. Choose the **Document No.** field to open the **Posted Purchase Invoices** page, and then select the posted purchase invoice that contains lines that you want to reverse.
7. Select the **Recalculate Lines** check box if you want the copied posted purchase invoice lines to be updated with any changes in item price and unit cost since the invoice was posted.
8. Choose the **OK** button. The copied invoice lines are inserted in the purchase credit memo.
9. Complete the purchase credit memo as explained in [To create a purchase credit memo from a posted purchase invoice](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-purchase-credit-memo-from-a-posted-purchase-invoice).

## To create a purchase return order based on one or more posted purchase documents

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab as necessary.
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, fill the lines manually, or copy information from other documents to fill the lines automatically:

    - Use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function to copy one or more posted document lines from one or more posted documents. This function always exactly reverses the costs from the posted document line. This function is described in the following steps.    
    - Use the **Copy from Document** function to copy an existing document to the return order. Use this function to copy the entire document. It can be either a posted document or a document that isn't yet posted. This function only enables exact cost reversing when the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** check box is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.  

5. Choose the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** action.
6. At the top of the **Posted Purchase Document Lines** page, select the **Show Reversible Lines Only** check box if you want to see only lines that have quantities that haven't yet been returned. For example, if a posted purchase invoice quantity has already been returned, you might not want to include that quantity on a new purchase return document.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This field only works for posted receipts and posted invoice lines, not for posted return or posted credit memo lines.  

    At the left side of the page, the different document types are listed, and the number in brackets shows the number of documents available of each document type.

7. In the **Document Type Filter** field, select the type of posted document lines you would like to use.  
8. Select the lines that you would like to copy to the new document.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to select all lines, all lines within the filter you have set are copied, but the **Show Reversible Quantity Only** filter is ignored. For example, suppose you have filtered the lines to a particular document number with two lines, one of which has already been returned. Even if the **Show Reversible Quantity Only** field is selected, if you select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to copy all lines, both lines are copied, instead of only the one that has not yet been reversed.  

9. Choose the **OK** button to copy the lines to the new document.  

    The following processes occur:  

    - For posted document lines of the type **Item**, a new document line is created that is a copy of the posted document line, with the quantity that hasn't yet been reversed. The **Appl.-to Item Entry** field is filled in as appropriate with the number of the item ledger entry of the posted document line.  

    - For posted document lines that aren't of the type **Item**, such as item charges, a new document line is created that is a copy of the original posted document line.  

    - Calculates the **Unit Cost (LCY)** field on the new line from the costs on the corresponding item ledger entries.  

    - If the copied document is a posted shipment, posted receipt, posted return receipt, or posted return shipment, the unit price is calculated automatically from the item card.  

    - If the copied document is a posted invoice or credit memo, the unit price, invoice discounts, and line discounts from the posted document line are copied.  

    - If the posted document line contains item tracking lines, the **Appl.-to Item Entry** field on the item tracking lines is filled with the appropriate item ledger entry numbers from the posted item tracking lines.  

     When you copy from a posted invoice or posted credit memo, application copies any relevant invoice discounts and line discounts as valid at the time of posting that document from the posted document line to the new document line. Be aware, however, that if the **Calc. Inv. Discount** option is activated on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page, then the invoice discount will be newly calculated when you post the new document line. The line amount for the new line might therefore be different than the line amount for the posted document line, depending on the new calculation of the invoice discount.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If part of the quantity of the posted document line has already been reversed or sold or consumed, a line is created for only the quantity that remains in inventory or that has not been returned. If the full quantity of the posted document line has already been reversed, a new document line is not created.  
    >
    >  If the flow of goods in the posted document is the same as the flow of goods in the new document, a copy of the original posted document line in the new document is created. The **Appl.-from Item Entry** field is not filled in because, in this case, exact cost reversing is not possible. For example, if you use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function to get a posted purchase credit memo line for a new purchase credit memo, only the original posted credit memo line is copied to the new credit memo.  

10. On the **Purchase Return Order** page, in the **Return Reason Code** field on each line, select the reason for the return.
11. Choose the **Post** action.

## To create a replacement purchase order from a purchase return order

You might agree with your vendor that they compensate you for a purchased item by replacing the item. The replacement item can be the same or it can be different. This situation could occur if the vendor mistakenly shipped the wrong item.  

1.  On the **Purchase Return Order** page for an active return process, on an empty line, make a negative entry for the replacement item by inserting a negative amount in the **Quantity** field.  
2. Choose the **Move Negative Lines** action.  
3. On the **Move Negative Purchase Lines** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The negative line is deleted from the purchase return order, and a new purchase order is created. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).  

## To create a purchase allowance

If you receive items from your vendor that aren't what you wanted, for example, if they're slightly damaged, the wrong color or the wrong size, the vendor might offer you a purchase allowance.  

You can post this reduced purchase cost as an item charge on a credit memo or return order and link it to the posted receipt. The following describes it for a purchase return order, but the same steps apply to a purchase credit memo.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty purchase credit memo.  
3. Fill in the credit memo header with information about the vendor who sent you the purchase allowance.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select **Charge (Item)**.  
5. In the **No.** field, select the appropriate item charge value.  

    You might want to create a special item charge number to cover purchase allowances.  
6. In the **Quantity** field, enter **1**.  
7. In the **Direct Unit Cost** field, enter the amount of the purchase allowance.  
8. Assign the purchase allowance as an item charge to the items in the posted receipt. For more information, see [Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md). When you have assigned the allowance, return to the **Purchase Credit Memo** page.

When you post the purchase return order, the purchase allowance is added to the relevant purchase entry amount. In this way, you can maintain accurate inventory valuation.  

## To combine return shipments

If you want to return items covered by different purchase return orders to the same vendor, then you can use the **Combine Return Shipments** function.  

When you ship the items, you post the related purchase return orders as shipped and this creates posted purchase return shipments.  

When you're ready to invoice these items, instead of invoicing each purchase return order separately, you can create a purchase credit memo and automatically copy the posted purchase return shipment lines to this document. Then you can post the purchase credit memo and conveniently invoice all the open purchase return orders at the same time.  

When return shipments are combined on a credit memo and posted, then a posted purchase credit memo is created for the invoiced lines. The **Quantity Invoiced** field on the originating purchase return order is updated based on the invoiced quantity. However, this original purchase return order isn't deleted, even if it has been fully received and invoiced, and you must therefore delete the purchase return order manually.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedure assumes that there are several purchase return orders for the vendor, and that they have been posted as shipped.     

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **Get Return Shipment Lines** action.  
5. Select multiple return shipment lines that you want to include in the invoice.  

    If an incorrect return shipment line was selected or you want to start over, you can just delete the lines on the purchase credit memo and then use the **Get Return Shipment Lines** function again.  
6. Choose the **Post** action.  

### To remove open purchase return orders after combined return shipment posting  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Purchase Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.  
3. Alternatively, delete the individual purchase return orders manually.

# Design Details: Inventory Periods
Backdated transactions or cost adjustments often affect balances and stock valuations for accounting periods that may be considered closed. This can have adverse effects on accurate reporting, especially within global corporations. The Inventory Periods feature can be used to avoid such problems by opening or closing inventory periods to limit posting in a set period of time.  

 An inventory period is a period of time, defined by an ending date, in which you post inventory transactions. When you close an inventory period, no value changes can be posted in the closed period. This includes new value postings, expected or invoiced postings, changes to existing values, and cost adjustments. However, you can still apply to an open item ledger entry that falls in the closed period. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md).  

 To make sure that all transaction entries in a closed period are final, the following conditions must be met before an inventory period can close:  

-   All outbound item ledger entries in the period must be closed (no negative inventory).  
-   All item costs in the period must be adjusted.  
-   All released and finished production orders in the period must be cost adjusted.  

 When you close an inventory period, an inventory period entry is created by using the number of the last item register that falls in the inventory period. In addition, the time, date, and user code of the user closing the period are recorded in the inventory period entry. By using this information with the last item register for the previous period, you can see which inventory transactions were posted in the inventory period. It is also possible to reopen inventory periods if you need to post in a closed period. When you reopen an inventory period, an inventory period entry is created.

# Set Up Units of Measure

As part of setting up your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you set up general units of measure on the **Units of Measure** page. Then, when you register new items, you specify the base unit of measure on the **Item Card** page. You can also add units of measure later.  

You can set up multiple units of measure for an item:

- Assign a base unit of measure to the item on the Item Card page. The base unit of measure defines how you store it in inventory and is the basis for conversion to alternate units of measure.
- Assign alternate units of measure to purchase, production, or sales documents to specify how many units of the base unit of measure you handle at a time in those processes. For example, you might buy the item on pallets and only use single pieces in your production.

If an item is stocked in one unit of measure but produced in another, a production order is created that uses a manufacturing batch unit of measure to calculate the correct quantity of the components during the **Refresh Production Order** batch job. An example of a manufacturing batch unit of measure calculation is when a manufactured item is stocked in pieces but produced in tons. To learn more, go to [Work with Manufacturing Batch Units of Measure](production-how-to-use-the-manufacturing-batch-unit-of-measure.md).  

Another tool that makes it easier to work with multiple units of measure for items is the ability to specify a rounding precision for base units of measure. Specifying a rounding precision provides guidance on what someone should enter for a given business process, and helps reduce rounding issues. When you use alternate units of measure, the value in the **Qty. per Unit of Measure** field helps calculate the quantity in the base unit of measure, which can lead to rounding issues. For example, imagine you're receiving one box that contains six items. When the box arrives at your warehouse, you discover that one of the six items is missing. You decide not to post the receipt of one box, but instead change the quantity received to five of six pieces. That decision would lead to a receipt of 4.99998 pieces, rather than five. On the **Item Units of Measure** page, the **Quantity Rounding Precision** field lets you specify a value that converts the quantity to a number that's easier to understand. Continuing with the example, we would enter **1** in the field to round up to an even five pieces.

## To set up units of measure

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Units of Measure**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. A new empty line is inserted.  
3. Fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. If you know that your organization sells items with this unit of measure to customers in other countries/regions, you can add translations.  
    1. Select the code for which you want to set up translations, and then choose the **Translations** action.
    2. In the **Language Code** field, select the drop-down arrow to see a list of available language codes. Select the language code for which you want to enter a translation, and then choose the OK button to copy the code to the field.
    3. In the **Description** field, enter the appropriate text.
5. Repeat the previous steps for any other units of measure that you want to add.  

When you register a new item, you can choose the base unit of measure from the list of units of measure that you set up. You can also set up multiple units of measure for an item.  

## To set up multiple item units of measure

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of the item for which you want to set up alternate units of measure.
3. Choose the **Units of Measure** action. The **Item Units of Measure** page opens.
4. If the **Base Unit of Measure** field on the item card is filled, then that unit of measure is already set up.
5. Choose the **New** action. A new empty line is inserted.
6. In the **Code** field, enter the name of the unit of measure. Alternatively, choose the field to select from the unit of measure codes that are in the database.
7. In the **Qty. per Unit of Measure** field, enter how many units of the base unit of measure the new unit of measure contains.
8. Optionally, in the **Height**, **Width**, **Length**, and **Weight** fields, specify precise information about the size of one unit of measure so that the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can calculate how many of each item unit can be placed in any given bin. The **Cubage** field is calculated automatically based on **Height**, **Width**, and **Length**.

    If any of these fields contain a value other than 0, then that measure is used during all processes that involve placing items in a bin: put-away, movements, receipts, shipments, picks, and adjustments. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks the sum of each physical measure of the items being put away. It also checks the items already in the bin against the maximum size or other measure that can fit into a bin. This information comes from the bin capacity policy on the location card where you store this item. In other words, you must use the same unit measure for each dimension across all item units of measure - use kilograms or pounds for weight, for example, but be consistent.
9. Repeat steps 5 through 7 to set up all the alternate units of measure that you want to use in different processes for this item.

    In the **Base Unit of Measure** field at the bottom of the window, you can view or change the item's base unit of measure. You can also change the base unit of measure in the **Base Unit of Measure** field on the item card. In the **Item Units of Measure** page, the base unit of measure must have the value **1** in the **Qty. per Unit of Measure** field.

You can now use the alternate units of measure on purchase, production, and sales documents. To learn more, go to [To enter a default unit of measure code for sales and purchasing transactions](#to-enter-a-default-unit-of-measure-code-for-sales-and-purchasing-transactions).  

## To set up unit of measure translations

When you sell items to foreign customers, you might want to specify the unit of measure in the customer's language. You can do that by specifying translations for units of measure.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Units of Measure**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the code for which you want to set up translations, and then choose the **Translations** action.
3. In the **Language Code** field, select the drop-down arrow to see a list of available language codes. Select the language code for which you want to enter a translation, and then choose the OK button to copy the code to the field.
4. In the **Description** field, enter the appropriate text.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for the unit of measure codes and the languages for which you want to enter translations.

## To enter a default unit of measure code for sales and purchasing transactions

If you usually buy or sell in units different from the base unit of measure, you can specify separate units of measure for purchases and sales. To use separate units of measure, set up the units of measure on the **Item Units of Measure** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant item card for which you want to specify a default sales or purchase unit of measure code.
3. For sales, on the **Invoicing** FastTab, in the **Sales Unit of Measure** field, open the **Item Units of Measure** page.
4. For purchasing, on the **Replenishment** FastTab, in the **Purch. Unit of Measure** field, open the **Item Units of Measure** page.
5. Select the code you want to set up as the default unit of measure for sales or purchasing respectively, and then choose the **OK** button.

# Power BI integration component and architecture overview

In this article, you'll learn about the different aspects of Power BI integration with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to help you understand its implementation and use.

## Components

The following table describes the major components involved with Power BI integration.

|Component|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|Power BI|A cloud-based report hosting and management service.|
|Power BI Desktop|An authoring tool for building reports and dashboards, and allows you to run reports. It's available as a free download on Microsoft Store and is installed locally.|
|[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]|Online or on-premises solution with connectors exposed to Power BI and the ability to embed a Power BI part.|

## What's available from the start

The following table describes available features.

|Feature|[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online or on-premises support|
|-------|---------------------|
|Power BI connectors|Both. Different connectors for online and on-premises. Same connector used for Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service |
|Embedded experience for viewing a given report inside a FactBox in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]|Both. Requires configuration to display reports for on-premises.|
|Power BI report management from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]|Online|
|Default Power BI reports on role centers deployed to Power BI|Online|
|Power BI Apps on Microsoft AppSource|Online|

## Architecture

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] integrates with Power BI through a connector using OData. The data source for Power BI reports is exposed as API pages and OData web services.

:::image type="content" source="./media/power-bi-architecture.svg" alt-text="Image alt text." lightbox="./media/power-bi-architecture.svg":::

Starting in February 2022, Power BI reports for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online are sourced from a secondary, read-only database replica. The database replica is part of the [read scale-out](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/database-read-scale-out-overview) capability in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. This configuration frees up the main database for transactions, which enhances performance of the system. Connecting to the read-only database replica is an integral part of the Business Central online connector, and requires no extra setup on your part. All new reports will connect to the read-only database replica by default. Old reports will still use the main database. For more information, see [Business Central 2021 Release Wave 2 Plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/smb/dynamics365-business-central/use-secondary-read-only-database-power-bi-reporting).

## General Flow

The following diagram illustrates the basic workflow for users when connecting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to Power BI.

![Power BI workflow  for integration with Business Central.](./media/power-bi-flow-v2.svg)

1. User signs up for a Power BI account.
2. User connects to Power BI from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
3. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the license.
4. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] deploys default reports to the Power BI service. This step only happens for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online.
5. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes reports in Power BI available for selection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Default reports are automatically displayed in Power BI parts.
6. User creates a report in Power BI Desktop.
7. User publishes the report to the Power BI service. The reports are then available for selection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# About production orders

Use production orders to manage the conversion of purchased materials into manufactured items. Production orders route work through various work or machine centers on the shop floor.  

Before they start production, most companies do supply planning, typically once a week, to calculate how many production orders and purchase orders they need fulfill sales demand. Purchase orders supply the required components according to the end item's bill of materials (BOM).

Production orders are central components in manufacturing, and contain the following information:  

- Products planned for manufacturing  
- Materials required for the planned production orders  
- Materials that are already selected  
- Products that were manufactured in the past  
- Materials that were used in previous manufacturing operations  

Production orders are the starting points for:  

- Planning future manufacturing  
- Controlling current manufacturing  
- Tracking of finished manufacturing  

## Production order creation  

You can create production orders on an order-by-order basis manually on the **Production Order** page, or generate them from the **Sales Order Planning** or **Order Planning** pages. You can also create multiple orders from the **Planning Worksheet** page.  

You create production orders using information from:  

- Items  
- Production BOMs

- Machine centers  
- Work centers  

## Reserving and tracking production orders to their source

Production orders are automatically reserved and tracked to their source when you create them from:  

- The [Planning Worksheet](production-how-to-run-mps-and-mrp.md) page.
- The [Sales Order Planning](production-how-to-create-production-orders-from-sales-orders.md) page.
- The [Order Planning](production-how-to-plan-for-new-demand.md) page.  
- The [Replan](production-how-to-replan-refresh-production-orders.md) action on production orders.  

To learn more, go to [Track Relations Between Demand and Supply](production-how-track-demand-supply.md).

If you create production orders by other means, they aren't automatically reserved and tracked.

## Production order status  

A production order can have one of the following statuses:

- Simulated
- Planned
- Firm Planned
- Released
- Finished

The status of a production order controls what you can do with it, and the form and content of the production. Production orders display on different pages according to their status. You can't change the status of a production order manually. To change the status of an order, use the **Change Status** action on the production order or use the **Change Production Order Status** page to change the status of one or orders in one go.

The **Change Status** action is available for the following types of orders:

- Simulated production orders
- Planned production orders
- Firm planned production orders
- Released production orders

> [!TIP]
> A confirmation dialog with additional questions displays for each order individually. If there are multiple orders with partial output or consumption, confirm each one separately.

If the status of orders can't change, they're skipped. The **Error Message** page shows the orders that were skipped and the reasons.  

### Simulated production order  

A simulated production order is unique because of the following characteristics:  

- It's a simulation you can use for quotes and costing. For example, when the Research and Development department wants a cost estimate for a proposed item. A simulated production order serves as an example of a production order.  
- They don't influence the planning of orders. MPS and MRP don't consider and aren't affected by simulated production orders. Also, you can't use a simulated production order as a template because it disappears when you change its status.  

### Planned production order  

A planned production order is unique because of the following characteristics:  

- You can automatically create a planned production order from a sales order.  
- Planned production orders are like released production orders and provide input to planning by showing the total capacity requirements by work center or machine center.  
- A planned production order represents the best estimate of the future load for the work center or machine center load based on available information. Typically, they're generated from planning, but you can also manually create them. However, they're erased the next time you run planning so it isn't practical to create them manually.  
- Their generation in planning results in a suggested "planned order release" that includes the quantity, release date, and due date. The planning system logic is based on the replenishment system, reorder policies, and order modifiers that it encounters in the net requirement planning process.  
- The load for each work center or machine center on the planned production order's routing shows their effect.  

### Firm planned production order  

A firm planned production order is unique because of the following characteristics:  

- You can automatically create a firm planned production order from a sales order.  
- A firm planned production order acts as a placeholder in the planning schedule for a future project released to the floor.  
- You can generate them during planning, create them manually, or create them from sales orders. They aren't erased during subsequent planning.  
- Their generation in planning results in a suggested "planned order release" that includes the quantity, release date, and due date. The planning system logic is based on the replenishment system, reorder policies, and order modifiers that it encounters in the net requirement planning process.  
- The load for each work center or machine center on the firm planned production order's routing show their effect.  

### Released production order  

The released production order is unique, based on the following characteristics:  

- You can automatically create a released production order from a sales order.  
- A released production order doesn't necessarily mean that materials are picked or the project moves to its first operation.  
- People typically create a released production order immediately after they enter the sales order in make-to-order (MTO) environments.  
- You can use a released production order to record the actual material consumption and product output. In addition, automatic flushing of consumption and product output only occur for released production orders.  

### Finished production order  

A finished production order is unique, based on the following characteristics:  

- A finished production order is typically one that is manufactured.  
- Finishing the production order is an important task in completing the costing lifecycle of the produced item. After you finish a production order, you can adjust and reconcile costing.  
- Finished production orders are used for reporting and to support the ability to track back to other orders (for example, sales, production, and purchases). The ability to track back to a finished production order allows you to review the detailed history.  
- You can't change finished production orders.  

#### Reopen a finished production order to make corrections

After you complete a production order and set its status to **Finished**, you might discover a mistake. For example, you might find that consumption is missing or the item tracking information is incorrect. To make sure that your inventory and cost transactions are correct, use the **Reopen** action on the **Finished Production Orders** page to make adjustments. However, to protect your data there are a few restrictions:

- You can only reopen an order one time.
- You can't reopen an order that has no output and cost was written off to an adjustment account.

## Production order execution  

After you create and schedule a production order, you must release it to the shop floor so that work can start. While you work on an order, you record:  

- The materials that were picked or consumed.  
- The time spent working on the order.
- The quantity of the item produced.

You can record this information manually or through automatic reporting. The method depends on the selection in the **Flushing Method** field on the item and work center.  

### Material consumption  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers options for how to record material consumption. For example, you can record material consumption manually, which can be useful if you often substitute components or generate more scrap than you expected.  

Consumption of materials can be processed through the [consumption journal](production-how-to-post-consumption.md), or [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can record it automatically, which is known as automatic reporting (flushing). The **Manual**, **Forward**, and **Backward** reporting methods are available.

Manual consumption reporting uses consumption journals to specify material picking.  

Forward consumption reporting assumes the expected quantity of all materials for the entire order is consumed at the release of a production order, unless you use routing link codes. When you use routing link codes, the material consumed after the start of the operational step is recorded in the output journal. To forward flush the entire production order, you need to do two things:  

- All items in the top-level production BOM need to have forward flushing selected on their respective item card.  
- All routing link codes on the production BOM must be removed.  

Backward consumption reporting records the actual quantity of all material picked or consumed when the status of a production order is changed to *Finished,* unless using routing link codes. When you use routing link codes, the material is consumed after a quantity of the parent item is recorded for the operational step in the output journal.  

When you refresh the production order, the flushing method is copied from the item card. The flushing method for each production order component controls how and when you record consumption. Therefore, it's important to note that you can change flushing method for specific items directly on the production order. To learn more, go to [Flush Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md).

### Production output  

You can track the time spent working on a production order and the quantity produced. This information can help you determine the costs of production. Also, manufacturers who use a standard costing system might want to record actual information in order to help them develop better standards.  

Output can be processed through [output journals](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md), but can also be recorded automatically. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] copies the flushing method from the machine center or work center card to the production order routing when refreshing. As with material consumption, there are **Manual**, **Forward**, and **Backward** reporting methods for output.

The Manual method uses the output journal to specify time consumed and quantity produced.  

The Forward method records the expected output (and time), which is automatically recorded at the release of a production order. Routing link codes aren't a factor in the forward flushing of the output.  

Backward method records the expected output (and time), which is automatically recorded at the finish of a production order. Routing link codes aren't a factor in the back flushing of the output.  

### Posting consumption and output  

You can use any combination of automatic flushing and manually recorded information for both consumption and output. For example, you might want to automatically forward flush components, but still use a consumption journal to record scrap. Similarly, you might want to automatically record output, but use an output journal to record scrap of the parent item or extra time spent on the order.  

Finally, if you enter consumption and output manually, you need to determine the sequence in which you're going to record this information. You can record consumption first and use a shortcut method to enter the information, which is based on expected quantity of output. Or, you can enter output first, using the **Explode Routing** action. You would then record consumption based on actual quantity of output.  

### Production journals  

The [Production Journal](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md) combines the functions of a consumption journal and output journals into one journal, which is accessed directly from the released production order.  

The purpose of a production journal is to provide a single interface for you to register consumption and output from a production order.  

Production journals have a simple view and provide you with the ability to:  

- Easily record output and consumption related to a production order  
- Relate the components to operations  
- Relate actual operation data with the standard estimates on a production order routing and component lines  
- Post and print an overview of registered operation data for a production order  

Production journals do many of the same things as consumption and output journals. Dimensions, item tracking, and bin contents are handled in the same way.  

However, production journals differ from the consumption and output journals in the following ways:  

- You open them directly from a released production order line and they're preset with the relevant data.
- They let you define which types of components to handle based on a flushing method filter on the journal.  
- Quantities and times already posted for the order display at the bottom of the journal as actual entries.  
- Fields where data entry is irrelevant are blank and noneditable.  
- You can specify how output quantities are preset in the journal. For example, that the last operation must have zero as the output quantity.  
- A confirmation message displays if you exit a journal without posting your changes.  
- They display operations and components together in a structure that provides an overview of the production process.  

In the production journal, consumption quantities are posted as negative item ledger entries, output quantities are posted as positive ledger entries, and times spent are posted as capacity ledger entries.

# Combine shipments on a single invoice

You can manually or automatically combine shipments from sales or service orders in a single sales or service invoice.  

Before you can create a combined shipment, you must post, but not invoice, more than one sales or service shipments for the same customer in the same currency.

> [!NOTE]
> The procedures in this article describe how to combine shipments in a sales invoice. The steps are the same for service invoices. Just replace the word "sales" with "service."

## To manually combine shipments on a single invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary. To learn more, go to [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md) or [Create service invoices or credit memos](service-how-create-invoices.md).
3. In the **Sell-to Customer No.** field, enter the customer to invoice for the shipped items.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Get Shipment Lines** action.  
5. Select the shipment line that you want to include in the invoice:  

    - To insert all lines, select all lines and choose the **OK** button.  
    - To insert specific lines, select the lines and choose the **OK** button. You can use the Ctrl key to select multiple nonsequential lines.  

    If an incorrect shipment line was selected or you want to start over, you can delete the lines on the invoice and rerun the **Get Shipment Lines** action.  
6. To post the invoice, choose the **Post** action.  

> [!TIP]  
> If you shipped orders where the **Sell-to Customer No.** is different from the **Bill-to Customer No.**, those lines don't display in the **Get Shipment Lines** report. Use personalization to add the **Sell-to Customer** field to the page and remove the filter. Now you can add shipment lines to the invoice regardless of the value in the **Sell-to Customer No.** field, as long as the **Bill-to Customer No.** field on the shipment lines matches the value on the sales invoice.  

## To automatically combine shipments on a single invoice

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] selects only sales orders where **Combine Shipments** is chosen.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Combine Shipments**, and then choose the related link. The batch job request page opens.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Choose the **Post Invoices** checkbox.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must manually post the invoices if the **Post Invoices** checkbox wasn't selected on the batch job.  

## To remove open sales orders after combined shipment posting

When you combine and post shipments on an invoice, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a posted sales or service invoice for the invoiced lines. The **Quantity Invoiced** field on the original order updates based on the invoiced quantity. The orders from which you post the shipments still exist, even if they're fully shipped and invoiced.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Sales Orders**, and then select the link.  
2. Specify in the **No.** filter field which sales orders to delete.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

Alternatively, delete individual sales or service orders manually.  

Repeat steps 1 through 3 for other affected documents, such as blanket sales orders.

# Get started creating report layouts

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes many built-in layouts that you can use on your reports. Other layouts might be added as part of extensions. In addition, you can create your own report layouts, either from scratch or based on an existing layout.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use report layouts to add content to email messages. Report layouts can help save time and ensure consistency by reusing the same content when you communicate with your customers. Only custom report layouts of the **Word** type can be used with email. You can't use layouts of the **RDLC** with email. Learn more in [Set up reusable email texts and layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts).

## Overview of report layouts

It can be helpful to think of a report layout as a file that is imported and assigned to a report. You manage all layouts in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in basically the same way, regardless of the layout type. Usually, you work from the **Report Layouts** page. The layouts differ mainly in the way that you design them. Each layout is designed by using the software that the layout is built on, such Word, Excel, or SQL Server Report Builder.

The process of setting up a layout for a report involves three or four basic tasks.

1. Choose the layout type.
2. Export a copy of an existing layout so that you can use it as a starting point.
3. Make changes to the layout file in the appropriate application.
4. Add the new layout file to the report.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can modify or replace only user-defined layouts. You can't modify or replace *extension layouts*, which are layouts that originate from an extension. On the **Report Layouts** page, you can tell whether a layout is a user-defined layout or an extension layout by looking in the **Extension** column. For an extension layout, the **Extension** column shows information about the source extension. For a user-defined layout, the **Extension** column is blank.
>
> Learn more about the difference between extension layouts and user-defined layouts in [Layout sources](ui-manage-report-layouts.md#layout-sources).

## Get started

Depending on your situation, the actual tasks vary. Use the following table to get started.

| What do you want to do? | Learn more |
|---|---|
| Figure out the best layout type to use for my situation. | [Decide what type of layout you want](#decide) |
| Create a new layout for a report, either from scratch or based on a copy of an existing layout. | [Create a new layout](#create) |
| Make changes to the layout that a report uses. | [Modify a layout](#modify) |
| Replace the current layout file that a report uses with a new version of the layout file. | [Replace a layout](#replace) |
| Change the current layout that a report uses to another layout. | [Setting the Layout Used by a Report](ui-set-report-layout.md) |
| Change the name and description of a layout. | [Rename a layout](#rename) |

| Validate a layout. | [Validate a layout](#validate) |
| View information about a layout. | [Get information about a layout](#get-information-about-a-layout) |
| Delete a user-defined layout. | [Delete a layout](#delete) |

## <a name="decide"></a>Decide what type of layout you want

The first task when you create a layout is to decide which [layout type](ui-manage-report-layouts.md#layout-types) you want. You can choose among the **Word**, **Excel**, and **RDLC** layout types. Your choice depends on how you want the generated report to look. It also depends on your knowledge of the software that is used to create the layout, such as Word, Excel, and SQL Server Report Builder.

* **Excel** layouts are generally the easiest to create and modify because summarizing data, adding graphics, and styling are common Excel features. However, not all reports have datasets optimized for Excel layouts. Aggregations and complex calculations work best with **RDLC** or **Word** layouts. The same applies to documents.
* If you're making only style changes, such as changes to the font type, size, and colors, a **Word** layout is a good choice.
* The capabilities for adding and rearranging data fields are more advanced in **Word** and **RDLC** layouts than in **Excel** layouts.
* **Word** and **RDLC** layouts are good choices for printable reports.
* The design concepts for **Word** and **RDLC** layouts are similar, but each has specific features that affect the report's appearance in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The same report might look different depending on whether a **Word** or **RDLC** layout is used.

## <a name="create"></a>Create a new layout

There are different methods for creating a new layout. The easiest methods involve using a copy of an existing layout. For these methods, you can either save the existing layout directly as a copy, or export it and then import it into a new layout. Another, more advanced method is to create a layout from scratch by using a blank layout.

### [Copy a layout](#tab/copy)

Copying an existing layout lets you quickly create a new, identical layout that you can customize.

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]

   The **Report Layouts** page lists all layouts for all reports.
1. Select the layout that you want to copy for the new layout, and then select the **Edit Info** action.

    If you select an extension layout, you're asked whether you want to edit a copy of it. Select **Yes**.

    > [!TIP]
    > To find the layout that you want, use the search field, the filter pane, and column sorting.

1. In the **Layout Name** field, enter a new name.
1. Turn on the **Save Changes to Copy** toggle, if it isn't already on.
1. Select **OK**.

    The new layout appears on the **Report Layouts** page.

If needed, you can change the settings in your new layout. To learn more, go to [Change settings in a new layout](#modify).

### [Export a layout copy and import it as a new layout](#tab/export)

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
1. Select the layout that you want to copy for the new layout, and then select the **Export Layout** action.

    The layout file is downloaded to your device.

    > [!TIP]
    > To find the layout that you want, use the search field, the filter pane, and column sorting.

1. Open the layout file in the appropriate application, such as Word (for a .docx file) or Excel (for an .xlsx file).

    Learn more in the following articles:

    * [Work with Word Layouts](ui-how-add-fields-word-report-layout.md)
    * [Working with Microsoft Excel layouts](ui-excel-report-layouts.md)
    * [Working with RDLC Layouts](ui-rdlc-report-layouts.md)

1. Make the required changes to the file, and then save it.
1. On the **Report Layouts** page, select **New**.
1. In the **Add New Layout for a Report** dialog box, fill in the fields described in the following table.

    | Field | Description | Mandatory |
    |---|---|---|
    | Report ID | Enter the ID that is assigned to the report. | Yes |
    | Layout Name | Enter a brief, descriptive name for the layout to help you easily identify it. | Yes |
    | Description | Enter more detailed information about the layout. | No |
    | Format Options | Set this field to match the type of the layout (for example, **Word**, **Excel**, or **RDLC**). | Yes |

1. Select **OK**.
1. Follow one of these steps to upload the layout file for the report:

    [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]

    The selected file is uploaded to the layout, and you're returned to the **Report Layouts** page.

To view how the report looks with the new layout, select the layout in the list, and then select **Run Report**.

### [Create from blank](#tab/blank)

When you create a new layout from a blank layout, you must design it completely. The layout file provides all the report fields that you can add and arrange as you require.

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
1. Select any layout that is for the same report that you want use the new layout for.
1. Select **New**.
1. In the **Add New Layout for a Report** dialog box, set the following fields.

    | Field | Description | Mandatory |
    |---|---|---|
    | Report ID | Enter the ID that is assigned to the report. | Yes |
    | Layout Name | Enter a brief descriptive name for the layout to help you easily identify it. | Yes |
    | Description | Enter more detailed information about the layout. | No |
    | Format Options | Set this field to match the type of the layout (for example, **Word**, **Excel**, or **RDLC**). | Yes |

1. Turn on the **Create a blank layout from the report object** option.
1. Select **OK**.

    The new layout appears in the list. The layout is blank, but all the report fields and captions are available so that you can start to add them to the layout.

1. You can now start to [design the layout](#modify).

    > [!TIP]
    > To find a layout, use the Search field, the Filter pane, or column sorting.

1. In the **Delete layout** dialog, select **Yes**.

## Mark a layout as obsolete

A layout can become obsolete for various reasons. For example, the data model might change, making the layout outdated, or a more efficient layout might be introduced, making the current layout redundant. Marking a layout as obsolete signals to others that it will likely be removed in a later release, so they should use an alternative layout.

To identify which layouts are obsolete, refer to the **Obsolete** column on the **Report Layouts page**. You can mark a user-defined layout as obsolete if needed. 

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. Select the layout that you want to change, and then select the **Edit Info** action.
3. Turn on the **Mark layout as obsolete** toggle.
4. Select **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> Extension layouts are marked as obsolete in AL code using the [ObsoleteState property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-obsoletestate-property) and can't be changed using the **Edit Info** action.

# Use OCR to Turn PDF and Image Files into Electronic Documents

From PDF or image files that you receive from your trading partners, you can have an external OCR service (Optical Character Recognition) generate electronic documents that can be converted to document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can [send it to the OCR service from the **Incoming Documents** page](#to-send-a-pdf-or-image-file-to-the-ocr-service-from-the-incoming-documents-page).

As an alternative to sending the file from the **Incoming Documents** page, the OCR service can offer the option to [process files forwarded to a dedicated email address](#to-send-a-pdf-or-image-file-to-the-ocr-service-by-email). Then, when you receive the electronic document back, a related incoming document record is created automatically in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

After some seconds, the OCR service will send the processed file to the **Incoming Documents** page as an electronic document record that can be [converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor](#to-receive-the-resulting-electronic-document-from-the-ocr-service), a sales invoice, credit memo or a journal entry.

Because OCR is based on optical recognition, it's likely that the OCR service will interpret characters in your PDF or image files wrongly when it first processes a certain vendor's documents, for example. It may not interpret the company logo as the vendor's name or it may misinterpret the total amount on a receipt because of its layout. To avoid these errors going forward, you can correct the errors in a separate version of the **Incoming Document** page. Then you send the corrections back to the OCR service to train it to interpret the specific characters and fields correctly next time it processes a PDF or image document for the same vendor. For more information, see [Train the OCR service to avoid errors](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md#to-train-the-ocr-service-to-avoid-errors).

The traffic of files to and from the OCR service is processed by a dedicated job queue entry. This job queue is created automatically when you enable the external OCR service connection. For more information, see [Set Up Incoming Documents](across-how-setup-income-documents.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The OCR feature is provided by external providers. Choose a service package that is appropriate for your organization and/or country/region. Find services compatible with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and details on available features at [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646).

## To send a PDF or image file to the OCR service from the Incoming Documents page

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Documents**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a new incoming document record and attach the file. For more information, see [Create Incoming Document Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).  
3. On the **Incoming Documents** page, select one or more lines, and then choose the **Send to Job Queue** action.

   The value in the **OCR Status** field changes to **Ready**. The attached PDF or image file is sent to the OCR service by the job queue according to the schedule, if no errors exist.
4. Alternatively, on the **Incoming Documents** page, select one or more lines, and then choose the **Send to OCR Service** action to immediately send the files for processing.

   The value in the **OCR Status** field changes to **Sent**, if no errors exist.

## To send a PDF or image file to the OCR service by email

From your email application, you can forward an email to the OCR service provider with the PDF or image file attached. For information about the email address to send to, see the OCR service provider's web site.

Since no incoming document record exists for the file, a new record will be created automatically on the **Incoming Documents** page when the OCR service sends the resulting electronic document. For more information, see [Create Incoming Document Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If you work on a tablet or phone, you can send the file to the OCR service as soon as you have taken a photo of the document, or you can create an incoming document directly. For more information, see [Create an incoming document record by taking a photo](across-how-create-income-document-records.md#create-an-incoming-document-record-by-taking-a-photo).

## To receive the resulting electronic document from the OCR service

The electronic document that is created by the OCR service from the PDF or image file is automatically received into the **Incoming Documents** page by the job queue entry that is set up when you enable the OCR service.

If you aren't using a job queue, or you want to receive a finished OCR document sooner than per the job queue schedule, you can choose the **Receive from OCR Service** action. This option will get any documents that are completed by the OCR service.

> [!NOTE]  
> If the OCR service is set up to require manual verification of processed documents, then the **OCR Status** field will contain **Awaiting Verification**. In that case, perform the following steps to sign in to the OCR service website to manually verify an OCR document.

1. In the **OCR Status** field, choose the **Awaiting Verification** hyperlink.
2. On the OCR service website, sign in using the credentials of your OCR service account. For more information, see [Set up an OCR service](across-how-setup-income-documents.md#to-set-up-an-ocr-service).

   Information for the OCR document is displayed, showing both the source content of the PDF or image file and the resulting OCR field values.
3. Review the field values and manually edit or enter values in fields that the OCR service has tagged as uncertain.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The OCR process is completed and the resulting electronic document is sent to the **Incoming Documents** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], according to the job queue schedule.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for any other OCR document to be verified.

Now you can proceed to create document records for the received electronic documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], manually or automatically. For more information, see the next procedure. You can also [connect the new incoming document record to existing posted or non-posted documents](across-how-connect-disconnect-income-document-records.md) so that the source file is easy to access from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## To create a purchase invoice from an electronic document received from the OCR service

The following procedure describes how to create a purchase invoice record from a vendor invoice received as an electronic document from the OCR service. The procedure is the same when you create, for example, a general journal line from an expense receipt or a sales return order from a customer.

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Description** and **No.** fields on the created document lines will only be filled if you have first mapped text found on the OCR document to the two fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can do this mapping as item references, for document lines of type Item. For more information, see [Use Item References](inventory-how-use-item-cross-refs.md). You can also use the **Text-to-Account Mapping** function. For more information, see [Map text on an incoming document to a specific vendor, G/L, or bank account](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md#to-map-text-on-an-incoming-document-to-a-specific-vendor-account).

1. Select the line for the incoming document, and then choose the **Create Document** action.

A purchase invoice will be created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on the information in the electronic vendor document that you received from the OCR service. Information will be inserted in the new purchase invoice based on the mapping that you've defined as a reference or as text-to-account mapping.

Any validation errors, typically related to wrong or missing data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], will be shown on the **Errors and Warnings** FastTab. For more information, see [Handle errors when receiving electronic documents](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md#to-handle-errors-when-receiving-electronic-documents).

### To map text on an incoming document to a specific vendor account

For incoming documents, you typically use the **Map Text to Account** action to define that a certain text on a vendor invoice received from the OCR service is mapped to a certain vendor account. Going forward, any part of the incoming document description that exists as a mapping text means that the **Vendor No.** field on resulting document or journal lines of type *G/L Account* are filled with the vendor in question.

In addition to mapping to a vendor account or G/L accounts, you can also map text to a bank account. This option is useful, for example, for electronic documents for expenses that are already paid, and for which you want to create a general journal line that is ready to post to a bank account.

1. Select the relevant incoming document line, and then choose the **Map Text to Account** action. The **Text-to-Account Mapping** page opens.
2. In the **Mapping Text** field, enter any text that occurs on vendor invoices that you want to create purchase documents or journal lines for. You can enter up to 50 characters.
3. In the **Vendor No.** field, enter the vendor that the resulting purchase document or journal line will be created for.
4. In the **Debit Acc. No.** field, enter the debit-type G/L account that will be inserted on resulting purchase document or journal line of type G/L Account.
5. In the **Credit Acc. No.** field, enter the credit-type G/L account that will be inserted on resulting purchase document or journal line of type G/L Account.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Do not use the **Bal. Source Type** and **Bal. Source No.** fields in connection with incoming documents. They are used for automatic payment reconciliation only. For more information, see [Map Text on Recurring Payments to Accounts for Automatic Reconciliation](receivables-how-map-text-recurring-payments-accounts-auto-reconcilliation.md).
6. Repeat steps 2 through 5 for all text on incoming documents that you want to automatically create documents for.

## To handle errors when receiving electronic documents

1. On the **Incoming Documents** page, select the line for an electronic document received from the OCR service with errors, indicated by the *Error* value in the **OCR Status** field.
2. Choose the **Edit** action to open the **Incoming Document** page.
3. On the **Errors and Warnings** FastTab, select the message, and then choose the **Open Related Record** action.
4. The page that contains the wrong or missing data, such as a vendor card with a missing field value, opens.
5. Correct the error or errors as described in each error message.
6. Proceed to process the incoming electronic document by choosing the **Create Manually** action again.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for any remaining errors until the electronic document can be received successfully.

## To train the OCR service to avoid errors

Because OCR is based on optical recognition, the OCR service can wrongly interpret characters in your PDF or image files when it first processes documents from a certain vendor, for example. It may not interpret the company logo as the vendor's name or it may misinterpret the total amount on an expense receipt because of its layout. To avoid such errors going forward, you can correct data received by the OCR service and then send the feedback to the service.

The **OCR Data Correction** page, which you open from the **Incoming Document** page, shows the fields from the **Financial Information** FastTab in two columns, one with the OCR data editable and one with the OCR data read-only. When you choose the **Send OCR Feedback** button, the content of the **OCR Data Correction** page is sent to the OCR service. Next time the service processes PDF or image files that contain the data in question, your corrections will be incorporated to improve the document recognition.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Documents**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open an incoming document record that contains data received from the OCR service that you want to correct.
3. On the **Incoming Document** page, choose the **Correct OCR Data** action.
4. On the **OCR Data Correction** page, overwrite the data in the editable column for each field that has an incorrect value.
5. To undo corrections that you have made since you opened the **OCR Data Correction** page, choose the **Reset OCR Data** action.
6. To send the corrections to the OCR service, choose the **Send OCR Feedback** action.
7. To save the corrections, close the **OCR Data Correction** page.

The fields on the **Financial Information** FastTab on the **Incoming Document** page are updated with any new values that you entered in step 4.

# Enable Automatic Breaking Bulk with Directed Put-away and Pick

For locations that use directed put-away and pick, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can break larger units of measure into smaller units of measure when it creates warehouse instructions for source documents, production orders, or internal picks and put-aways. To breakbulk can also mean gathering items in smaller units of measure to equal the quantity of a larger unit of measure on a source document or production order.

## Breakbulk in picks  

If you want to store items in several different units of measure in a location and allow them to be automatically combined in the picking process, turn on the **Allow Breakbulk** toggle on the Location Card page. Afterward, to fulfill a task [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will look for an item in the same unit of measure. If it doesn't find one, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest that you break a larger unit of measure into the unit of measure that is needed.  

If only smaller units of measure are available, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest that you gather items to fulfill the quantity on the shipment or production order. In effect, it breaks the larger unit of measure on the source document into smaller units for picking.  

## Breakbulk in put-aways  

In warehouse put-aways, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests Place action lines in the put-away unit of measure. For example, it might suggest pieces even though the items arrive in a different unit of measure.  

## Breakbulk in movements  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can also breakbulk in replenishment movements if the **Allow Breakbulk** toggle on the **Calculate Bin Replenishment** page is turned on.  

You can view the results of the conversion process from one unit of measure to another as intermediate breakbulk lines in the put-away, pick, or movement instructions.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you select the **Set Breakbulk Filter** field on the warehouse instruction header, application will hide the breakbulk lines whenever the larger unit of measure is going to be completely used. For example, if a pallet is 12 pieces and you'll use all 12 pieces, the pick will then direct you to take 1 pallet and place 12 pieces. However, if you must pick only 9 pieces the breakbulk lines aren't hidden, even if you've selected the **Breakbulk Filter** field. The lines aren't hidden because you must put the remaining three pieces somewhere in the warehouse.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want your units of measure to perform optimally in the warehouse, also in connection with breakbulk, you should try to:  
>
> - Set up the base unit of measure for an item as the smallest unit of measure that you expect to handle in your warehouse processes.  
> - Set up your alternative units of measure for the item as multiples of the base unit of measure.

# Design details: Creating warehouse entries

Warehouse entries contain information about item movements within the warehouse. For example, you create entries when you post a warehouse journal, or any transaction that moves items from one place to another. Each transaction can create several warehouse entries and warehouse register records. Warehouse register records have the first and last warehouse entry numbers. This information lets you identify the warehouse entries that a particular action created. And, conversely, each warehouse entry has a field that points to the warehouse register.

The following image illustrates the relationship between warehouse registers and warehouse entries for three transactions.

:::image type="content" source="media/warehouse register and entries.png" alt-text="Diagram shows the relations between warehouse register records and warehouse entries.":::

## Creating warehouse transactions

When [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates warehouse transactions, it checks the `ConcurrentWarehousingPosting` feature key to determine how to assign entry numbers to warehouse register records and warehouse entries.

### If the feature key is turned off

If the feature key is turned off, both tables are locked. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in both tables and assigns a number that is one digit higher. For example, if the last entry number is 10, then it assigns the number 11. This method of assignment ensures that warehouse entry numbers are consecutive in the warehouse register, but it blocks other users from registering warehouse transactions.

### If the feature key is turned on

If the feature key is turned on, which it is by default, entry numbers in both tables are assigned from `SequenceNumbers` in the database to allow users to register warehouse transactions at the same time. Using sequence numbers might cause warehouse entry numbers from two or more transactions to overlap, as the following image shows.

:::image type="content" source="media/warehouse register and entries 2.png" alt-text="Diagram shows how warehouse register records and warehouse entries can overlap.":::

## When to turn off the feature key

You might want to turn off the `ConcurrentWarehousingPosting` feature key if you work with a feature or extension that extends warehouse management and the following are true:

* The feature relies on consecutive entry numbers.
* The feature locks tables during a process.

# Chart of sustainability accounts and ledger

This article explains how to manage the chart of sustainability accounts (CoSA), categories and subcategories, and details about sustainability ledger entries.

## Chart of sustainability accounts

The CoSA forms the foundational structured list that is used to record all emissions, water, and waste data. It serves as a framework that categorizes and organizes sustainability accounts based on their attributes, such as the scope or other groupings. Each account is typically assigned a unique code or number for easy reference and tracking. It has the same structure as a traditional chart of accounts but is customized specifically to monitor sustainability-related data and metrics in an organization.  

Users can add sustainability account categories and sustainability account subcategories to define how the system behaves. In this way, they can select dedicated emissions, water, or waste for tracking, emission factors, formulas, and similar configurations.

> [!NOTE]
> Based on the greenhouse gas (GHG) standards, there are three emission scopes:
>
> - **Scope 1 emissions** include emissions from stationary and mobile combustion, and from inadvertent fugitive emissions.
> - **Scope 2 emissions** include indirect emissions from the generation of energy that is purchased from utility providers.
> - **Scope 3 emissions** include a wide spectrum of emissions, from purchased goods and services and capital goods, to fuel and energy–related activities, to upstream and downstream transportation, to generated waste, to business travel and employee commuting, and so on.
> - **Out of scope** is for situations where you can't assign a specific emission to the transaction.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also select **Water/Waste** as one of options in the **Emission Scope** when they want to post transactions related to the water and waste management.  

From the CoSA, you can do things such as:

- View reports that show sustainability ledger entries and balances.
- Open the sustainability account card to add or change settings.
- View the category and subcategory for the account.
- View separate balances for each emission for a single account.
- Add single or multiple dimensions to each account and set dimension filters.

You can add, change, or delete sustainability accounts. However, to prevent discrepancies, you can't delete a sustainability account if one or more ledger entries are associated with it.

### Add or change accounts

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Sustainability Accounts**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Chart of Sustainability Accounts** page, you can open each sustainability account, and then add or change settings. Hover over a field to read a short description.

For accounts of the **Total** account type, you must set the **Totaling** field.

For accounts of the **End-Total** type, the **Indent** action automatically sets the **Totaling** field. After you set up all the accounts, select the **Indent Chart of Sustainability Accounts** action to run the **Indent** action and set the **Totaling** field.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Indent Chart of Sustainability Accounts** action overwrites the value of all fields for **End-Total** accounts. Therefore, if you entered definitions in the **Totaling** field for **End-Total** accounts before you ran the **Indent Chart of Sustainability Accounts** action, you must enter them again after you run it.  

### Delete accounts

You can delete a sustainability account. However, you must first make sure that no ledger entries are associated with it. Business Central prevents you from deleting a sustainability account if one or more ledger entries are associated with it.

## Account categories

You must add a sustainability account category to each sustainability account to define how the system behaves. You can select emission scopes (gas, water, or waste), dedicated to type of transaction to track, formulas, and similar configurations.  

To review sustainability account categories, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Account Categories**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Account Categories** page, you can edit the existing list or create a new category. To create a new category, select the **New** action.
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.
4. In the **Emission Scope** field, select one of the scope options related to gas emissions or water or waste intensity.
5. Select the gas emissions, or water or waste intensity, that you want to track. Currently, the following options are available: **CO2**, **CH4**, **N2O**, **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, and **Waste Intensity**. You can select any combination that you want to track, but you must select at least one of them.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you choose one of gas emissions scopes as the **Emission Scope** you can select the **CO2**, **CH4**, or **N2O**, but you can't select the **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, or **Waste Intensity**. Also, if you select **Water/Waste** as the **Emission Scope**, you can select only the  **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, or **Waste Intensity**, but you can't select **CO2**, **CH4**, or **N2O**.

6. In the **Calculation Foundation** field, select the calculation foundation (formula) to use for emission calculations if you don't know the accurate emission or water or waste intensity amount.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the formulas in the **Calculation Foundation** field aren't enough, you can extend the field and add more calculations for use in sustainability journals.

7. If you selected **Custom** in the **Calculation Foundation** field, you can configure a custom description in the **Custom Value** field.

If you set the **Calculation Foundation** field, the following table explains how [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates emissions based on the option that you selected. In the table, **EF** represents the **Emission Factor** value that you can configure on the **Sustainability Account Subcategory** page.

| Emission Type | Calculation Foundation | Formula | Comment |
|---------------|------------------------|---------|---------|
| **Scope 1** | | | |
| Stationary combustion | Fuel/Electricity | *Emission* = *Fuel* &times; *EF* | *Fuel* = Amount of fuel that is spent for boilers, heaters, thermal oxidizers, and so on. |
| Mobile combustion | Fuel/Electricity | *Emission* = *Fuel* &times; *EF* | *Fuel* = Amount of fuel that is spent for on-road or off-road vehicles, rail, and so on. |
| | | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *EF* | *Distance* = Mileage of on-road or off-road vehicles, rail, and so on. |
| Fugitive emissions | Installation | *Emission* = *Installation multiplier* &times; *Custom Amount* &divide; 100 &times; *Time Factor* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Assembly losses, annual leak rate, and so on. |
| **Scope 2** | | | |
| Utility providers | Fuel/Electricity | *Emission* = *Electricity* &times; *EF* | *Fuel/Electricity* = Electricity quantity, steam quantity, heating unit, and so on. |
| | Custom | *Emission* = *Custom Amount* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Thermal unit, ton-hour, and so on. |
| **Scope 3** | | | |
| Purchased goods and services, and capital goods | Custom | *Emission* = *Custom Amount* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Cost (GL), and so on. |
| Upstream transportation and distribution | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *EF* | |
| | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *Multiplier* &times; *EF* | *Multiplier* = Load Factor / Tons of cargo *|
| Downstream transportation and distribution | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *EF* | |
| | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *Multiplier* &times; *EF* | *Multiplier* = Load Factor / Tons of cargo *|
| Waste generated in operations and end-of-life treatment of sold products | Custom | *Emission* = *Custom Amount* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Waste |
| Business travel and employee commuting | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *EF* | *Distance* = Mileage of the used company car, rental car, train, flight, and so on. |
| | Custom | *Emission* = *Custom Amount* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Hotel stays |
| | Fuel/Electricity | *Emission* = *Fuel* &times; *EF* | *Fuel* = Amount of fuel spent in the company car, rental car, and so on. This is the only formula used for water or waste intensity calculation. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This note applies to the formulas for **Upstream Transportation and Distribution** and **Downstream Transportation and Distribution** when you use the tons-of-cargo calculation model. While you can adapt the formulas, we recommend against using the exact number of tons of cargo as a multiplier. Instead, consult your sustainability advisor to ensure accurate calculations because emissions don't increase linearly with weight. A more accurate approach is to use the **Load Factor**, which represents the percentage of the truck's total capacity utilized (by weight or volume). The load factor can be calculated as **Weight of Cargo** / **Maximum Load Capacity of Truck**. But always confirm with your sustainability expert before you finalize calculations.

## Account subcategories

You must add a sustainability account subcategory to each sustainability account. This subcategory defines the emission factors that the formulas use, based on the emission tracking choice in the sustainability account category.

To review sustainability account subcategories, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Account Subcategories**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Account Subcategories** page, you can edit the existing list or create a new category. To create a new category, select the **New** action.
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.
4. Based on the gas emissions that you track in the sustainability account category and connect this subcategory to, you can also set one or more emission factors:

    - **Emission Factor CO2** – The emission factor for carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emission.
    - **Emission Factor CH4** – The emission factor for methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emission.
    - **Emission Factor N2O** – The emission factor for nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) emission.
    - **Water Intensity Factor** - The intensity factor for Water.
    - **Discharged Into Water Factor** - The intensity factor for Discharged Into Water.
    - **Waste Intensity Factor** - The intensity factor for Waste.

5. If the subcategory is related to renewable energy, select the **Renewable Energy** field. However, you can select this field only if it's related to gas emissions and to water or waste.  

> [!NOTE]
> The **Import Data** and **Import From** fields are intended for integration with external systems that are used to collect emission factors. However, in **2024 release wave 1**, these fields can't be used as a feature by default.

You can have more than one account subcategory for a sustainability account, but only one can be set as the default value. You must set the default value for the account every time if you want to use it for posting.  

> [!TIP]
> For example, if you want to use one account for cars, but you have different types of cars with different emission factors. You can set up one account and create account subcategories for the different emission factors. When you work in a sustainability journal, you can change your account subcategory based on the car type.  

## Sustainability ledger entries

The sustainability ledger stores the history of all posted sustainability transactions and organizes all emission data according to the CoSA. When you post a sustainability journal, the data is recorded there. All active reports are generated based on the sustainability ledger entries.

To open this ledger for a specific account, use the **Ledger Entries** action on the **Chart of Sustainability Account** page. To open all the ledger entries, select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Ledger Entries**, and then select the related link. Hover over a field to read a short description.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After you post your data to the sustainability ledger, you can't delete it. If you made a mistake, you can post a reverse transaction that has the same details but uses the negative sign for the amount.

> [!NOTE]
> If you posted entries before enabling **CO<sub>2</sub>e** in the **Emission Fees** page, you can run the **Update Carbon Fees** action from the **Emission Fees** page to recalculate carbon equivalent to in all transactions in the **Sustainability Ledger Entries**.

# Record Special Purchase Prices and Discounts

> [!NOTE]
> In 2020 release wave 2 we released streamlined processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer using that version, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you are using the new experience depends on whether your administrator has enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. For more information, see [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

The different price and discount agreements that apply when you buy from different vendors must be defined so that the agreed rules and values are applied to purchase documents that you create for the vendors.

When you have recorded special prices and line discounts for sales and purchases, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that your profit on item trade is always optimal by automatically calculating the best price on sales and purchase documents and on project and item journal lines. For more information, see [Best Price Calculation](purchasing-how-record-purchase-price-discount-payment-agreements.md#best-price-calculation).

Concerning prices, you can have a special purchase price inserted on purchase lines if a certain combination of vendor, item, minimum quantity, unit of measure, or starting/ending date exists.

Concerning discounts, you can set up and use two types of purchase discounts:

| Discount Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Purchase Line Discount** |An amount discount that is inserted on purchase lines if a certain combination of vendor, item, minimum quantity, unit of measure, or starting/ending date exists. This type works in the same way as for purchase prices. |
| **Invoice Discount** |A percentage discount that is subtracted from the document total if the value amount of all lines on a purchase document exceeds a certain minimum. |

Because purchase line discounts and purchase prices are based on a combination of item and vendor, you can also enter this configuration from the item card, where the rules and values are defined. For more information, see [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

## To set up a special purchase price for a vendor

## To set up a line discount for a vendor

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant vendor card, and then choose the **Line Discounts** action.

   The **Vendor No.** field is prefilled with the vendor number.
3. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Fill a line for each combination for which the vendor grants you a purchase line discount.

## To set up an invoice discount for a vendor

When your vendors have informed you which invoice discounts they grant, enter the invoice discount code on the vendor cards and set up the terms for each code.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the vendor card for a vendor that will be eligible for invoice discounts.
3. In the **Invoice Disc. Code** field, select a code for the relevant invoice discount terms to use to calculate invoice discounts for the vendor.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Invoice discount codes are represented by existing vendor cards. This enables you to quickly assign invoice discount terms to vendors by picking the name of another vendors who will have the same terms.

    Proceed to set up new the purchase invoice discount terms.
4. On the **Vendor Card** page, choose the **Invoice Discounts** action. The **Vend. Invoice Discounts** page opens.
5. In the **Currency Code** field, enter the code for a currency that the invoice discount terms on the line applies to. Leave the field blank to set up invoice discount terms in USD.
6. In the **Minimum Amount** field, enter the minimum amount that an invoice must have to be eligible for the discount.
7. In the **Discount %** field, enter the invoice discount as a percentage of the invoice amount.
8. Repeat steps 5 through 7 for each currency that the vendor will receive a different invoice discount for.

The invoice discount is now set up and assigned to the vendor in question. When you select the vendor code in the **Invoice Disc. Code** field on other vendor cards, the same invoice discount is assigned to those vendors.

## To choose a principle for posting purchase discounts

When you post a purchase invoice that includes one or more discounts, you can choose between two principles for posting discount amounts. You can post discounts separately or you can subtract discounts from invoice discounts.  

Before you can do this, you must have already set up the necessary accounts for posting discount amounts in the chart of accounts. You must also check that you have entered the correct account numbers in the general posting setup in the **Purch. Line Disc. Account** and **Purch. Inv. Disc. Account** fields.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Discount Posting** field, choose one of the following principles for posting discounts.

|**Discount Posting Principle**|**Invoice Discount**|**Line Discount**|  
|------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|  
|**All Discounts**|Posted separately|Posted separately|  
|**Invoice Discounts**|Posted separately|Subtracted|  
|**Line Discounts**|Subtracted|Posted separately|  
|**No Discounts**|Subtracted|Subtracted|  

## Purchase invoice discounts and service charges

If you have fixed terms for invoice discounts with any vendors, you can enter them for those vendors. Then the discount will be calculated when you fill in a purchase invoice.  

Before you can use invoice discounts with purchases, you must specify the vendors that offer you the discounts.  

You link discount percentages to specific invoice amounts in **Vend. Invoice Discounts** pages. You can enter any number of percentages in each page. Each vendor can have its own page, or you can link several vendors to the same page.  

In addition to a discount percentage, you can link a service charge amount to a specific invoice amount.  

You can define the terms of the invoice discount in LCY for domestic vendors and in foreign currency for foreign vendors.  

You can choose to have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically calculate the invoice discounts for quotes, blanket orders, orders, invoices, or credit memos.  

> [!TIP]  
> Before you enter this information, it is a good idea to prepare an outline of the discount structure that you want to use. This makes it easier to see which vendors can be linked to the same invoice discount page. The fewer pages that you have to set up, the faster that you can enter the basic information.

## Best price calculation

When you have recorded special prices and line discounts for sales and purchases, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that your profit on item trade is always optimal by automatically calculating the best price on sales and purchase documents and on project and item journal lines.

The best price is the lowest permissible price with the highest permissible line discount on a given date. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically calculates this price when it inserts the unit price and the line discount percentage for items on new document and journal lines.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following describes how the best price is calculated for sales. The calculation is the same for purchases.

1. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks the combination of the bill-to customer and the item and then calculates the applicable unit price and line discount percentage, using the following criteria:

    - Does the customer have a price/discount agreement, or does the customer belong to a group that does?
    - Is the item or the item discount group on the line included in any of these price/discount agreements?
    - Is the order date (or the posting date for the invoice and credit memo) within the starting and ending date of the price/discount agreement?
    - Is a unit of measure code specified? If so, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks for prices/discounts with the same unit of measure code, and prices/discounts with no unit of measure code.

2. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks if any price/discount agreements apply to information on the document or journal line, and then inserts the applicable unit price and line discount percentage, using the following criteria:

    - Is there a minimum quantity requirement in the price/discount agreement that is fulfilled?
    - Is there a currency requirement in the price/discount agreement that is fulfilled? If so, the lowest price and the highest line discount for that currency are inserted, even if LCY would provide a better price. If there is no price/discount agreement for the specified currency code, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] inserts the lowest price and the highest line discount in LCY.

If no special price can be calculated for the item on the line, then either the last direct cost or the unit price from the item card is inserted.

# Cross-Dock Items

Cross-dock items are items you receive and ship without putting them away. The put-away and pick processes require limited handling of items. You can cross-dock items for shipments and for production orders.

## Cross-dock bins and zones

If you're using bins, set up at least one cross-dock bin, and then specify the bin in the **Cross-Dock Bin Code** field on your locations. If you're using directed put-away and picks, set up a cross-dock zone.

When you prepare a shipment or pick items for production and you're using bins, the item is automatically picked from a cross-dock bin before any other bin. You must look in the cross-dock area to see whether the items you need are available there before you get the items in their usual storage area.  

If you've calculated cross-dock quantities, put-away lines to the cross-dock bin for cross-dock calculations are created when you post the receipt. Other put-away lines are created as usual.  

## Cross-dock select lines for a receipt

If you want to post the cross-dock items right away to make them available for picking, you must also register a put-away for the other items originating from the receipt line, namely those that need to be stored. If only some items on a receipt line are being cross-docked, you must therefore make an effort to put away the remaining items as quickly as possible. Alternatively, your warehouse policy could be to encourage cross-docking of entire receipt lines whenever possible.

In the put-away instruction, delete the Take and Place instruction lines for each receipt line for the items to put away. You can recreate the instruction lines later as put-away lines from the put-away worksheet or the posted receipt. After you delete the instruction lines you can put away and register the lines for cross-dock items.  

## About the Put-away Worksheet page

If you turn on the **Use Put-away Worksheet** toggle on the **Location Card** page, and post your receipt with calculated cross-docks, all receipt lines become available in the worksheet. The cross-dock information is lost and can't be recreated. Therefore, to use cross-dock functionality, you should relay lines to the put-away worksheet by deleting put-away instructions rather than using the automatic relay function provided in the **Use Put-away Worksheet** field.  

If you post the warehouse receipt and the **Use Put-away Worksheet** toggle is turned off, the cross-dock items become separate lines on the put-away instructions. The **Cross-Dock Information** field on each put-away line shows whether the line contains the following:

* Cross-dock items.
* All of the items from a receipt must be stored.
* Some items from a receipt must be stored, and some are to be cross-docked.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't keep separate records for cross-docked items. It registers them as ordinary put-away instructions.  

## To set up the warehouse for cross-docking  

1. If you're using bins, set up at least one cross-dock bin. If you're using directed put-away and picks, set up a cross-dock zone.  

    A cross-dock bin has the **Cross-Dock Bin** field selected. To learn more about bins, go to [Create Bins](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md).  

    If you are using zones, create a zone for your cross-dock bins, and select the **Cross-Dock Bin Zone** field. If you are using directed put-away and picks, select bin type with **Pick** selected, for example you can use *PICK* or *PUTPICK*. To learn more about zones and bin types, go to [Set Up Locations to Use Bins](warehouse-how-to-set-up-locations-to-use-bins.md) and [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).  

2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Location**, and then choose the related link.  
3. On the **Location** page, select the location that you want to set up the warehouse for cross-docking, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
4. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, turn on the **Use Cross-Docking** toggle and fill in the **Cross-Dock Due Date Calc.** field with the time to search for cross-dock opportunities.

    The **Use Cross-Docking** option is only available if the **Require Receipt**, **Require Shipment**, **Require Pick**, and **Require Put-away** fields are selected.  

5. If you're using bins, on the **Bins** FastTab, fill in the **Cross-Dock Bin Code** field with the code of the bin you would like to use as the default cross-dock bin.  
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Stockkeeping Unit**, and select the related link.  
7. For each item or stockkeeping unit that you want to be able to cross-dock, select the item, and then choose the **Edit** action.
8. On the **Stockkeeping Unit Card** page, select the **Use Cross-Docking** check box.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Cross-docking is only possible if your location is set up to require warehouse receive and put-away processing.  

## To cross-dock items without viewing the opportunities  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a warehouse receipt for an item that's arrived and can be cross-docked. To learn more about receiving, go to [Receive Items](warehouse-how-receive-items.md).  
3. Fill in the **Qty. to Receive** field, and then choose the **Calculate Cross-Dock** action.  

    Outbound source documents requesting the items that are scheduled to leave the warehouse within the date formula time period are identified. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates quantities so that you can cross-dock as much as possible and avoid having to put items away, without piling up too many items in the cross-dock area. The value in the **Qty. to Cross-Dock** field is the sum of all the outbound lines for the item within the look-ahead period minus the quantity that is already placed in the cross-dock area, or it is the value in the **Qty. to Receive** field on the receipt line, whichever is smaller. You can't cross-dock more than you have received.  

4. To cross-dock the quantity as suggested, post the receipt. You can also decide to change the quantity to cross-dock to a higher or lower value and then post the receipt.  

    The amounts to be cross-docked now appear as lines in the put-away instruction, assuming the **Use Put-away Worksheet** field is cleared. The quantities not cross-docked also become lines in the put-away instruction.  

    If you have bins, the cross-docked items have been assigned to the default cross-dock bin defined on the location card.  

5. Delete the **Take** and **Place** lines for items that you won't cross-dock.  
6. Print the put-away instruction for the remaining lines, and place the quantities of the receipt that need to be stored in the appropriate bins or in the appropriate area of the warehouse. Place the cross-dock items in the area or bin designated for them by warehouse policy. Sometimes, warehouse policy might require that you to just leave them in the receiving area.  
7. To register the cross-docked items as being put-away and available for picking, choose the **Register** action.  

## To cross-dock items after viewing the opportunities  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a warehouse receipt for an item that has arrived and can be cross-docked.  

    You want to view the source document lines that are requesting the item before you post the receipt.  
3. Choose the **Calculate Cross-Dock** action.  

   On the **Cross-Dock Opportunities** page you can see the most important details about the lines requesting the item, such as type of document, quantity requested, and due date. This information might help you to decide how much to cross-dock, where to place the items in the cross-dock area, or how to group them.  

4. Choose **Autofill Qty. to Cross-Dock** action to show how the quantities on the receipt lines are calculated. When you change the number of items in the **Qty. to Cross-Dock** field on each line, the calculation updates. The update doesn't mean that the shipment or production order will actually receive the items being suggested for cross-docking. It's for testing purposes only. The process can be informative, however, if more than one unit of measure is involved.  
5. To reserve a quantity of the item for an order line, choose the line, and then choose the **Reserve** action. On the **Reservation** page, reserve available quantity of the item. The reservation is like any other reservation and doesn't have higher priority because it was created in connection with cross-docking. To learn more about reservations, go to [Reserve Items](inventory-how-to-reserve-items.md).   
6. When you're finished recalculating or reserving, choose the **OK** button to bring the calculation to the **Qty. to Cross-Dock** field on the receipt line, or choose the **Cancel** button to return to the warehouse receipt and calculate the cross-dock again.  
7. Post the receipt. You can continue in the put-away instruction as described in steps 3 through 7 in [To cross-dock items without viewing the opportunities](#to-cross-dock-items-without-viewing-the-opportunities).

    > In the warehouse put-away, you can continue to change the quantities that are being put away in storage or cross-docked, as necessary. For example, you might decide to cross-dock an extra quantity to expedite the cross-dock registration.  

## To view cross-docked items in a shipment or pick worksheet  

If you're using bins, when you open a shipment or the pick worksheet the quantity of each item in the cross-dock bins updates. When the item is available in the cross-dock bin, you can create a pick for the items on the shipment. In the pick worksheet, you can edit the lines as needed.  

When a production order is released, the lines are available in the pick worksheet and the **Qty. on Cross-Dock Bin** field shows whether the items have arrived and are in the cross-dock bins. When you create a pick instruction, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests that you pick the cross-docked items first. Items in storage bins are suggested afterward.  

If you aren't using bins, remember to check the cross-dock area from time to time, or rely on notifications from receipts that items for production have arrived.

# Reconcile bank accounts with Copilot

This article explains how bank account reconciliation assist can help you reconcile bank transactions with ledger entries in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

## About bank account reconciliation assist

Bank account reconciliation assist is a set of AI-powered features that help you reconcile bank accounts. It offers two distinct tasks through Copilot:

- Improved matching of transactions with ledger entries

    As you might already know, the **Match Automatically** button on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page automatically matches most bank transactions with ledger entries. We refer to this operation as *automatch*. Although automatch works well, the algorithms that it uses can sometimes result in many unmatched transactions. Copilot uses AI technology to inspect those unmatched transactions and identify more matches, based on the dates, amounts, and descriptions. For example, if a customer paid multiple invoices in one lump sum that you have registered as individually paid invoices, Copilot reconciles the single bank statement line with the multiple bank ledger entries.

    [Learn more about this task](#reconcile-bank-accounts-with-copilot).

- Suggested general ledger (G/L) accounts

    For residual bank transactions that can't be matched to any ledger entries, Copilot compares the transaction description with G/L account names and then suggests the most likely G/L account to post to. For example, if unmatched transactions have the narrative *Fuel Stop 24*, Copilot might suggest that you post them to the *Transportation* account.

    [Learn more about this task](#post-unmatched-bank-transaction-amounts-to-suggested-gl-accounts).

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support](includes/copilot-language-support.md)]

## Prerequisites

- The **Bank account reconciliation** capability is activated. An administrator must complete this task. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).
- You're familiar with bank account reconciliation in Business Central. Learn more in [Reconcile Bank Accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).

## Reconcile bank accounts with Copilot

<!-- Similar to the **Match Automatically** capability on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, Bank account reconciliation assist can also automatically matches transactions in banks statements with bank entries. The difference is that **Match Automatically** uses a native rules-based algorithm, while Bank account reconciliation assist is based AI technology though Copilot. Bank account reconciliation assist is intended to supplement the **Match Automatically** capability. While **Match Automatically** is fairly successful at matching transactions, there are some instances where it can't&mdash;which is where Bank account reconciliation assist comes. By using the **Reconcile with Copilot** action on **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, you can find even more matches.-->

Copilot in bank account reconciliation is intended to supplement the automatch operation. Therefore, when you use Copilot, the automatch operation runs first to make the initial matches. Then Copilot runs to try to match transactions that the automatch operation didn't handle.

You can use two approaches to reconcile bank accounts with Copilot:

- Use Copilot to start a new reconciliation on a bank account, directly from the **Bank Account Reconciliations** list.
- Use Copilot on a new or existing reconciliation on a **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** card.

# [From the Bank Account Reconciliation list](#tab/fromlist)

For this approach, you create and reconcile a new bank account reconciliation from scratch. This approach requires that you select the bank account. If the bank account isn't linked to an online account, you must also import the bank statement file.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Account Reconciliations**, and then select the related link.
1. Select ![Shows the copilot icon](media/copilot-icon.png) **Start a Copilot prompt action** > **Reconcile** to open the **Reconcile with Copilot** window.
1. Set the **Perform reconciliation for this bank account** field to the bank account that you want to reconcile.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Reconcile with Copilot window for reconciling from scratch.](media/reconcile-bank-accounts-new-copilot.svg)

1. If the selected bank account isn't linked to an online bank account, you must import the bank statement file. To import the file, either select the value in the **Use transaction data from** field or select the paper clip button next to the **Generate** button. Then use **Select the file to import** to import the bank statement file by either dragging it from your device or browsing your device.
1. To reconcile with Copilot, select **Generate**.

    Copilot starts to generate proposed matches. When it finishes, the **Reconcile with Copilot** window shows the results of the matching process.

1. Review the proposed matches as described in the next section.

# [From a Bank Acc. Reconciliation card](#tab/fromcard)

For this approach, you use Copilot either on a new bank account reconciliation that you manually create or by editing an existing reconciliation.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Account Reconciliations**, and then select the related link.
1. Follow one of these steps:

    - Select **New** to start a new reconciliation. Add the statement lines, either manually or by using **Suggest Lines** action to get a copy of the bank ledger entries as a starting point.
    - Select and open an existing reconciliation in the list.

1. On the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** card, select ![Shows the Copilot icon](media/copilot-icon-rainbow.png) > **Reconcile with Copilot** in the upper-right corner.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Reconcile with Copilot button on a Bank Acc. Reconciliation card.](media/bank-reconciliation-copilot-card.png)

    Copilot starts to generate proposed matches. When it finishes, the **Reconcile with Copilot** window shows the results of the matching process.

1. Review the proposed matches as described in the next section.
---

### Review, save, or discard proposed matches

After you run Copilot, the **Reconcile with Copilot** window shows the detailed results, including any proposed matches. At this point, no match that Copilot proposed has been saved. Therefore, you have an opportunity to inspect the proposals and save or discard them as you want.

![Screenshot that shows proposed matches in the Reconcile with Copilot window.](media/bank-reconciliation-copilot-window.png)

The **Reconcile with Copilot** window is divided into two sections. The upper section provides some general details about the result. The lower section, **Match proposals**, lists the matches that Copilot proposed.

The following table describes the fields in the upper section.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Auto-matched | The number of bank statement lines that the automatch operation matched. Select the value to view the reconciliation card. |
| Copilot matched | The number of bank statement lines that Copilot proposed matches for. You can view details of the matches in the **Match proposals** section. |
| Statement Ending Balance | The ending balance that is shown on the bank statement that you're reconciling with. |
| Post if fully applied | Turn on this option to automatically post the bank account reconciliation when all lines (100 percent) are matched and you select **Keep it**. |

In the **Match proposals** section, review the proposed matches line by line. Then take the appropriate action:

- To discard a single proposed match, select it in the list, and then select **Delete Line**.
- To discard all proposed matches and close the **Reconcile with Copilot** window, select the ![Discard button.](media/copilot-delete-trash-can.png) **Discard it** button next to the **Keep it** button at the bottom of the window.
- To automatically post the fully matched reconciliation when you save it, turn on the **Post if fully applied** option.
- To save the matches that are currently shown in the **Reconcile with Copilot** window, select **Keep it**.

## Post unmatched bank transaction amounts to suggested G/L accounts

This section explains how to use Copilot to post unreconciled bank account statement line amounts (as specified in the **Difference** field) to a G/L account. This task can be done only from an existing reconciliation.

1. Go to the **Bank Account Reconciliations** list, and open the existing reconciliation that includes the unreconciled lines.

    This step gives you a clear view of any unreconciled bank statement lines that must be transferred to the G/L account.

1. In the **Bank statement lines** pane, identify the unmatched bank statement lines, and select one or more lines that you want to reconcile.

    Copilot focuses on the selected lines to post new payments to the G/L account.

1. Select ![Shows the Copilot icon](media/copilot-icon-rainbow.png) > **Post Difference to G/L Account** to start the process.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Post Difference to G/L Account button on the Bank Acc. Reconciliation card.](media/bank-reconciliation-transfer-gl-copilot-card.png)

    Copilot starts to generate proposals for posting new payments.

1. After Copilot finishes generating proposals, the **Copilot Proposals for Posting Differences to G/L Accounts** window appears.

    The **Match proposals** section of this window shows the proposals. The experience resembles the experience for reconciling with Copilot.

    ![Screenshot that shows Copilot Proposals for Posting Differences to G/L Accounts window.](media/bank-reconciliation-gl-transfer-proposed-matches-v2.png)

    To post the differences as regular journal entries, you must specify the general journal template and batch to use. This allows you to reverse the transaction if you need to later.

1. Review the proposals line by line to ensure the accuracy of the suggested payments for posting.

    - If you drill down on the proposal by selecting it in the list, you're taken to a list of accounts. From there, you can select another account. You can do this type of manual correction only when you use the **Post Difference to G/L Account** flow, not the matching flow.
    - If you select **Save** next to a proposal, you can add the mapping to the **Text-to-Account Mapping** page. Then, the next time that this text appears during matching, it's mapped to the proposed account.

1. Discard or save proposals.

    - To discard a specific proposal, select it in the list, and then select **Delete Line**. To discard all proposals and close Copilot, select the ![Discard button.](media/copilot-delete-trash-can.png) **Discard it** button next to the **Keep it** button at the bottom of the window.
    - If the proposals meet your requirements, and you want to save them, select **Keep it**.

         This step confirms the transfer of the currently selected proposals from the bank account ledger to the G/L account. It posts new payments to the proposed G/L accounts and applies corresponding lines to the resulting bank account ledger entries.

# Troubleshoot and correct dimensions

Financial reporting and analysis views often rely on data from dimensions. Despite the safeguards that are available, sometimes a mistake happens that can lead to inaccuracies. This article describes some of the typical errors, and explains how to correct dimension assignments on posted transactions so that financial reports are accurate.

## Troubleshooting dimensions errors

When you post documents or journal lines that contain dimensions, various errors might occur. However, they're typically related to an incorrect dimension setup or assignment.

> [!NOTE]
> In the following list of potential error messages, the *%X* codes are placeholders for the data variables that the actual message will contain in the UI depending on the context. For example, *%1 %2 is blocked.* could appear in the UI as "Dimension Code AREA is blocked.".  

|Issue|Error Message|Possible Solution|
|-----|-------------|-----------------|
|Blocked dimension|%1 %2 is blocked.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension and unblock it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the blocked dimension.|
|Deleted dimension|%1 %2 can't be found.|-Restore the missing dimension.<br />-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the missing dimension and add it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the missing dimension.|
|Blocked dimension value|%1 %2 - %3 is blocked.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension value and unblock it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the blocked dimension value.|
|Deleted dimension value|    %1 for %2 is missing.|-Restore the missing dimension value.<br />-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the missing dimension value and add it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the missing dimension value.|
|Disallowed dimension value|Dimension Value Type for %1 %2 - %3 must not be %4.|-Change the **Dimension Value Type** field on the **Dimension Values** page to **Standard** or **Begin-Total**.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the blocked dimension value.|
|Blocked dimension combination|Dimensions %1 and %2 can't be used concurrently.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension combination and unblock it.<br />-Modify one of the conflicting permission set lines for the dimension combination.|
|Blocked dimension value Combination|Dimension combinations %1 - %2 and %3 - %4 can't be used concurrently.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension value combination and unblock it.<br />-Modify one of the conflicting permission set lines for the dimension value combination.|
|Blank dimension value code for default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **Code Mandatory**|-Select a %1 for the %2 %3.<br />-Select a %1 for the %2 %3 for %4 %5.|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Enter a nonblank dimension value for the conflicting dimension in the dimension set.|
|Wrong dimension value code for default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **Same Code**|-Select %1 %2 for the %3 %4.<br />-Select %1 %2 for the %3 %4 for %5 %6|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Enter the required dimension value for the conflicting dimension in the dimension set.|
|Nonblank dimension value code for blank default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **Same Code**|-%1 %2 must be blank.<br />-%1 %2 must be blank for %3 %4.|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Enter a blank dimension value code for the conflicting dimension in the dimension set.|
|Unexpected dimension value for default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **No Code**|-%1 %2 must not be mentioned.<br />-%1 %2 must not be mentioned for %3 %4|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Remove the conflicting line from the dimension set.|
|A dimension correction doesn't complete correctly.||-Choose **Reset** to revert the correction to a draft state. This resets the changes, and you can run the correction again.|

## Changing dimension assignments after posting

If you discover an incorrect dimension on posted general ledger entries, you can correct the dimension values and update your analysis views. The correction helps keep your financial reports and analyses accurate.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The features for correcting dimensions are intended only to help make financial reporting accurate. Dimension corrections apply only to the G/L entries. They do not change the dimensions assigned to the entries in other ledgers for the same transaction. There will be a mismatch between the dimensions assigned in the general ledger and the sub-ledgers.

### Set up dimension corrections

There are two things to consider when setting up dimension corrections:

* Are there dimensions that you don't want to allow people to change? On the **Dimension Correction Settings** page, specify the dimensions that you want to block for changes.
* Who can change dimensions? To allow people to make changes, assign the **D365 DIM CORRECTION** permission to the users. The permissions allow them to create dimension corrections, run them, and undo them if needed. They can also specify blocked dimensions. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md). 

### Correct a dimension

You can manually select one or more general ledger entries, or use filters to select sets of entries. If needed, you can also add or delete dimensions. 

1. To start a dimension correction, use one the following pages:

    * On the **G/L Registers** page, by selecting a register, and then choosing the **Correct Dimensions** action. This action starts a correction for the entries in the selected register.
    * On the **General Ledger Entries** page, by choosing the **Correct Dimensions** action. 

2. In the **Description** field, enter information about the change. Other people might use this information later to understand what was done.
3. On the **Selected Ledger Entries** FastTab, choose the relevant entries.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When you change a selection, the values on the **Dimension Correction Changes** FastTab are reset. Therefore, always select the entries before you specify dimension value changes.

   The following table describes the options.

   |Option  |Description  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Add Related Entries     |Add G/L entries that are in the same G/L register.|   
   |Add by Filter     |Use filter criteria when adding G/L entries.|
   |Manual Selection     |Select specific G/L entries.         |
   |Add by Dimensions     |Filter G/L entries by dimensions.         |
   |Remove Entries     |Deselect G/L entries.         |
   |Manage Selection Criteria     |Keep track of the selection process, and undo selections if needed.         |

4. On the **Dimension Correction Changes** FastTab, choose the dimension that you want to change in the **Dimension Code** field, and the new value in the **New Dimension Value Code** field.
5. To validate that the correction, choose **Validate Dimension Changes**. For more information, see [Validating Dimension Corrections](finance-troubleshooting-correcting-dimensions.md#validate-dimension-corrections).
6. Choose **Run**.

### Validate dimension corrections

Before you run a correction, it's a good idea to validate it first. Validation checks for restrictions on value posting for the G/L accounts, restrictions for dimensions, and whether the dimension values are blocked. During validation, the status of the correction is set to **Validation in Process**. After you validate a correction, the result is shown in the **Validation Status** field. If errors were found, you can use the **View Errors** action to investigate them. After you correct an error, you must use the **Reopen** action to run the correction or a new validation.

You can either run a correction immediately, or schedule it to run a later time. If you're running corrections on a large data set, we recommend that you schedule it to run outside business hours. For more information, see [Dimension Corrections on Large Data Sets](finance-troubleshooting-correcting-dimensions.md#dimension-corrections-on-large-data-sets).

### Undo a correction

After you correct a dimension, if you don't like what you see you can use the **Undo** action to reset the previous value. However, you can only undo the most recent correction. Before you undo a correction, you can validate the changes that result from the undo action. For example, validation is useful if dimension restrictions changed after the correction was made.

If the Undo action isn't available, for example because you have many corrections, you can use the **Copy to Draft** action to start a new correction for the same entries.

### Dimension corrections on large data sets

Use caution when correcting large sets of entries, for example, sets that include more than 10,000 entries. If you can, we recommend that you use the filters to run the corrections on smaller sets of data. It's also a good idea to run corrections outside the normal business hours. 

### Use analysis views with dimension corrections

If **Update on Posting** is enabled for an analysis view, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can update the view when documents and journals are posted. You can also update views with this setting enabled with results of dimension corrections. To do so, turn on the **Update Analysis Views** toggle. Updating analysis views can affect performance, especially for large data sets, so we recommend that you update analysis views only for small data sets.  

### View historical dimension corrections

If a general ledger entry was corrected, you can investigate the change by using the **History of Dimension Corrections** action.

### Handle incomplete corrections

If a correction doesn't complete, a warning displays on the correction card. If that happens, you can use the **Reset** action to revert the correction to a draft status and undo the changes. You can then run the correction again.

> [!NOTE]
> Resetting an incomplete correction will not affect updates to analysis views because those happen at the end of the correction process.

### Use cost accounting with corrected G/L entries

After you correct dimensions, your data for cost accounting is out of sync. Cost accounting uses dimensions to aggregate amounts for cost centers and cost objects, and to run cost allocations. Changing dimensions for G/L entries probably means that you should rerun your cost accounting models. Depending on the data that was updated and how your cost accounting capabilities are set up, you might need to:

* Delete just a few cost registers and rerun allocations.
* Delete everything and rerun all of your models.

You must manually identify where dimension corrections affect cost accounting, and where updates are needed. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't currently provide an automated way to do that.

# The VAT Group Management extension for the United Kingdom

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

You can connect one or more businesses in the United Kingdom to combine value-added tax (VAT) reporting under a single registration number. This type of arrangement is known as a *VAT group*. You can engage with the group as a member or as the group representative.

## Forming a VAT group

VAT group members and the group representative can use the **Set Up VAT Group Management** assisted setup guide to both define their engagement with the group and create a connection between their [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenants. The group members use this connection to submit their VAT returns to the group representative. The group representative then uses a single VAT return to submit the group's VAT to tax authorities.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports intra-group VAT return submissions for companies using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or online, in any combination, which influences the communication setup between businesses. This article describes various group setups.

### License requirements

Participants in the group must be licensed to use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can't use guest accounts in VAT groups.

* To calculate and submit VAT returns, a user must be a full [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user.
* To sign in and do basic tasks, such as create accounts, you need a [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] Team Member license.

## Set up a VAT group

The following is the recommended order of steps an administrator uses to set up a VAT group:

1. Create the setup in [Microsoft Entra ID setup for group members](#microsoft-entra-id-setup-for-group-members).
2. Share the technical information VAT group members and the group representative need to connect their [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenants. Usually, the group representative has this information, such as the [API URL](#group-api-setup) and the name of the VAT group representative's environment the VAT group members submit their VAT data to.
3. Create users that VAT group members use to authenticate when they connect to the VAT group representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The users must have full user licenses for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
4. Run the **Set Up VAT Group Management** assisted setup guide to connect the VAT group members.

   The VAT group representative must supply certain information to group members to complete their setup. (Learn more in the [Set up VAT group members](#set-up-vat-group-members) section below.) Make a note of the **Group Member ID** for each VAT group member. The group representative needs these IDs to add the companies to the VAT group.
5. Set up the VAT group management extension in the VAT group representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using the **Set Up VAT Group Management** assisted setup guide.

> [!NOTE]
> To connect to the VAT group representative, group members must have a user account that can access the VAT group representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The VAT group representative must create at least one user for this. However, for security reasons we recommended that they create a user for each VAT group member, which can be a system user account that is not related to an actual person. Make sure to distribute the user credentials to VAT group members in a secure way.

### Microsoft Entra ID setup for group members

When the VAT group representative is using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online or on-premises, VAT group members must use Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate users when they submit VAT returns to the VAT group representative. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, members must configure single sign-on. Learn more at [Configure Microsoft Entra authentication with WS-Federation](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/authenticating-users-with-azure-active-directory?tabs=singletenant%2Cadmintool).

If the VAT group members are also using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the member can authenticate with the designated user credentials and the sign-in information provided by the group representative. Learn more in the [Set up VAT group members](#set-up-vat-group-members) section below.

VAT group members who have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises must set up an app registration in Microsoft Entra ID for the VAT group representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant. The app registration enables the VAT group representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online to authenticate the group member. Learn more at [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

When the VAT group member's administrator creates the app registration in Microsoft Entra ID, they must specify the following information.

* In the **Authentication** section, add **Web** as a platform, and use the following **Redirect URL**: `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/OAuthLanding.htm`.
* In the **Authentication** section, in the option to select **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra directory - Multitenant)**.
* In the **Certificates & secrets** section, create a new client secret and note the value. The VAT group members need the secret when they set up the connection to the group representative.
* In the **API permissions** section, add permissions to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Enable delegated access to **Financials.ReadWrite.All** and **user_impersonation**.
* In the **Overview** section, note the **Application (client) ID**. The VAT group members need the ID when they set up the connection to the group representative.

### Group API setup

The VAT group representative creates and supplies an API to group members. The members use this API to connect to the representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant and submit VAT returns. VAT group members often use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in separate Microsoft Entra tenants. For that reason, setup is needed to connect the VAT group member and the representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> This setup requires credentials for an administrator account that has a full user license for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

1. In the Business Central admin center for the representative's tenant, choose the **Environments** tab.
1. Choose the representative's environment.
1. In the **Details** section, copy the **URL**.
1. Open Notepad, and paste the URL. Replace `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com` with `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0`.

## Set up VAT group members

VAT group members connect to the representative by calling a web service on the VAT group representative's tenant. The caller must be authenticated using OAuth2. When the VAT group management extension is set up, members are asked to authenticate to the VAT group representative, during which an access token is generated and saved. This access token is used when submitting VAT returns to the VAT group representative.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The member companies in the VAT group do not need to connect to HMRC because they report through the group's representative.

Before VAT group members start their setup (listed below), they need to contact the VAT group representative for the following information about their [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant:

* The API URL
* The name of their company
* Sign in credentials for the dedicated user

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Settings** ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") icon, then choose the **Assisted setup** action.
2. Choose the **Set Up VAT Group Management** action.
3. In the **VAT Group Role** field, choose **Member** then **Next**.
4. Copy the value of the **Group Member ID** field, and then share it with the VAT group representative so they can add your company as an approved member of the group.
5. In the **Group Representative Product Version** field, specify the version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] the representative is using.
6. In the **API URL** field, enter the API URL provided by the VAT group representative. Typically, the URL is formatted as follows: `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/[TENANT-ID]/[ENVIRONMENTNAME]`. For example, `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee/UKRepresentative`.
7. In the **Group Representative Company** field, enter the company name of the VAT group representative, such as, **CRONUS UK Ltd**.
8. In the **Authentication Type** field, choose **OAuth2**. If the VAT group representative is using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, enable the **Group Representative Uses Business Central Online** toggle, and then choose **Next**.

   Then, follow the steps in either the [VAT Group Representative uses Business Central online](ui-extensions-vat-group.md#vat-group-representative-uses-business-central-online) or [VAT Group Representative uses Business Central on-premises](ui-extensions-vat-group.md#vat-group-representative-uses-business-central-on-premises) section below.

### VAT group representative uses Business Central online

1. Enter the user credentials provided by the VAT group representative, and add the required permissions to generate the access token.
2. Choose the VAT report configuration you use to submit VAT returns to the UK tax authorities. 

After you complete the setup, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will create a new configuration based on this choice that enables you to submit VAT returns to the VAT group representative.

### VAT group representative uses Business Central on-premises

1. Enter the user credentials provided by the VAT group representative and choose **Next**.
2. In the **Client ID** field, specify the client ID from the app registration in [Microsoft Entra ID setup for group members](#microsoft-entra-id-setup-for-group-members).
3. In the **Client Secret** field, specify the client secret from the app registration in Microsoft Entra ID.
4. In the **OAuth 2.0 Authority Endpoint** field, enter `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2`.
5. In the **OAuth 2.0 Resource URL** field, enter `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/`.
6. In the **OAuth 2.0 Redirect URL** field, enter `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/OAuthLanding.htm`.
7. When you've specified the various fields, choose **Next**, and then confirm the authentication connection to generate the access token.
8. Choose the VAT report configuration you use to submit VAT returns to the UK tax authorities.

## Set up the VAT group representative

> [!NOTE]
> For on-premises, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports only a single tenant instance of the group representative.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The representative company must enable the **HMRC VAT Setup** service connection on the **Service Connections** page. Representatives must also download VAT return periods from HMRC.

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Settings** icon ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center"), and then choose the **Assisted setup** action.
2. Choose the **Set Up VAT Group Management** action.
3. In the **VAT Group Role** field, choose **Representative** to act as the VAT group representative, then choose **Next**.
4. In the **Group Settlement Account** field, specify the settlement account used for the group member VAT tax amounts. This account should have **Assets** as the **Account Category**.
5. In the **VAT Settlement Account** field, specify the account you use for VAT settlements. This account should have **Liabilities** as the **Account Category**.
6. In the **VAT Due Box No.** field, specify the box that represents the total VAT amount due from a VAT group submission.
7. In the **Group Settlement General Journal Template** field, specify the general journal template used to create the document with which the group representative posts the group VAT to the settlement account.
8. The **Approved Members** field shows the number of group members set up to submit VAT returns to the group representative. To add new members, choose the number to open the **VAT Group Approved Members** page and add the following information:
    1. In the **Group Member ID** field, enter an identifier for the group member, as displayed during the group member setup (learn more in the [VAT group member setup](#set-up-vat-group-members) section above).
    2. In the **Group Member Name** field, specify the name of the group member.
    3. In the **Company** field, specify the company from which the group member submits VAT returns in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as, **CRONUS UK Ltd**.
    4. Specify contact details for the company.

## Use the VAT group management features

VAT group members use the standard processes to prepare VAT returns. The only difference is members must choose the **VATGROUP** report version in the **VAT Return** page to submit the VAT return to the VAT group representative rather than the authorities. Learn more at [About the VAT Return report](finance-how-report-vat.md#vatreturn).

> [!NOTE]
> VAT group members can correct submitted VAT returns as long as the group representative has not released the VAT return for the group. To make a correction, the VAT group member must create a new VAT return for the VAT return period and submit it to the VAT group representative. On the VAT group representative's side, the member's latest VAT return replaces the previous and is included on the **VAT Returns** page.

The following sections describe the tasks that VAT group representatives must do to file the group VAT return.

### Review VAT member submissions

The **VAT Group Submissions** page lists the VAT returns that members have submitted. The page serves as a draft location for the submissions until the VAT group representative includes them in a VAT return for the group. The representative can open the submissions to review the individual boxes containing the amount reported by each VAT group member.

> [!TIP]
> On the **VAT Return Periods** page, the **Group Member Submissions** field shows how many returns members have submitted. To ensure that this number is up to date, choose the **Get VAT Returns** action.

### Create a group VAT return

To report VAT for the group, on the **VAT Returns** page, create a VAT return for your company only. Afterward, include the most recent VAT submissions from VAT group members by choosing the **Include Group VAT** action.  

When the group representative has submitted the group's VAT return to the authorities, the representative then normally runs the **Calculate and Post VAT Settlement** action. This action closes open VAT Entries and transfers amounts to the VAT settlement account. Currently, this action doesn't take the group submissions into account. Only the VAT entries of the VAT group representative company are posted. The VAT group member submission amounts must be posted using the **Post Group VAT Settlement** action.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The VAT group functionality is only supported in those markets where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses a VAT framework that consists of VAT returns and VAT return periods. You cannot use VAT groups in markets with other implementations of local VAT reporting, such as Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland.

## Issue with enabling Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

If you get an error message related to authorization during the renewal of the **OAuth2 Token** on the **VAT Report Setup** page after you enable MFA, complete the following steps.  

1. Sign in to the **Azure Portal** as an Authentication Administrator.  
2. Go to the **Microsoft Entra ID**.   
3. Browse to **Users**, and then select the user you want to perform an action.  
4. Select the **Authentication methods** and at the top of the page, select **Require re-register multifactor authentication**. 
5. Go back to Dynamics 365 Business Central and select to renew the token from the **VAT Report Setup**.  

This should be a onetime setup after you enable multifactor authentication for the user selected in **VAT Report Setup**.

# Record consumption or usage for projects

From the **Project Card** page, you can open the **Project Planning Lines** page to review and record use on various parts of your project. This information is automatically updated when you modify and transfer information between projects and project journals or project invoices. This requires that you turn on the **Apply Usage Link by Default** toggle on the **Project Setup** page. Learn more at [Set Up Projects](projects-how-setup-jobs.md).  

For example, for planning lines of type **Budget**, you can enter the quantity of a resource, and then specify the quantity to transfer to the project journal. If the type of the planning line is **Billable**, you can enter the quantity of the resource, and then specify the quantity to transfer to an invoice. To learn more about invoicing the customer, go to [Invoice Projects](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md). By comparing the original quantity, remaining quantity, or posted quantity you can quickly review use information. To learn more about how to estimate budgeted values during planning, go to [Manage Project Budgets](projects-how-manage-budgets.md).  

The following procedures describe how to record actual (budgeted) quantities and costs with a project journal. Alternatively, you can use purchase documents to record purchases for a project. Learn more at [Manage Project Supplies](projects-how-manage-project-supplies.md).

## To record usage for a project planning line of type Budget

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the project, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action. 
3. Select a project planning line of type **Budget** or **Both Budget and Billable** for which you want to record usage.   

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also record usage for a project planning line of type **Billable**. Typically, you use these lines to create invoices, but you can also transfer the information to a journal. Learn more at [Invoice Projects](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md) 

4. In the **Qty. To Transfer to Journal** field, enter the quantity to transfer. The default quantity is the value that you enter in the **Quantity** field.

    The **Remaining Quantity** field shows the quantity that remains to complete the project and transfer to the journal.
5. Choose the **Create Project Journal Lines** action.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you are going to add more project planning lines for this project, wait with this step until you have added all project planning lines.
6. On the **Project Transfer Project Planning Line** page, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
7. Choose the **Open Project Journal** action.  
8. On the **Project Journal** page, select the relevant line and then choose the **Post** action.

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

9. On the **Project Planning Lines** page, review the recorded usage by observing the **Quantity**, **Remaining Quantity**, and **Qty. To Transfer to Journal** fields.  
10. Repeat steps 3 through 8 to record additional usage.  

## To create project journal lines manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Batch Name** field, choose a relevant project journal batch.  
3. On a new line, enter document number, project number, project task number, type, and the quantity of the type being consumed.  
4. When the project journal lines are complete, choose the **Post** action.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

## To view project usage estimates and post updates

You can view project usage up to the completion of a project in one step. To do so, you use the **Project Calc. Remaining Usage** batch job for all the tasks up to and including the end of a project.  

This lets you track and compare your original estimates against actual results and make modifications or new entries as needed. For example, you may have estimated that a project required 10 hours, and to date, it has taken 15 hours. You can add the extra five hours to the existing journal line or create a new journal line to report these five hours as overtime, which is another work type. The appropriate cost and price are calculated, and you can then post to the journal.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Item entries create item ledger entries and reduce the inventory quantity. The **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job transfers the cost from inventory to the general ledger. Resource entries create resource ledger entries.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a relevant project journal, and then choose the **Calc. Remaining Usage** action.  
3. On the **Project Calc. Remaining Usage** page, enter the document number and posting date that is to be inserted in the journal, and then choose the **OK** button.  
4. Update the journal with any modifications that may be needed.  
5. Choose the **Post**.

## Create inventory and warehouse pick documents for a project

Use the **Create Inventory Pick** and **Create Warehouse Pick** actions on the **Project Card** page. To create or register a pick document, use the **Put-away/Pick Lines/Movement Lines** or **Registered Pick Lines** actions. Learn more at [Flows for Production, Assembly, and Projects](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).

You can use the actions under the following conditions:

* The **Status** of the project is **Open**.
* The **Line Type** of the project planning line is **Budget** or **Both Budget and Billable**.
* The **Type** of the project planning line is **Item**.
* **Require Pick** is enabled for the related location.
* **Directed Pick and Put-away** is disabled.

> [!NOTE] 
> Although the setting is called **Require Pick**, you can still post consumption directly from the project journal line for the location. If your location is set up to require pick processing but not shipment processing, you use the **Inventory Pick** page to organize and print the picking information. You also use the page to enter and post the result of the pick, which in turn posts the consumption of the items. 
> 
> If your location is set up to require both pick and shipment processing, meaning that you have chosen both the **Require Pick** and **Require Shipment** fields on the **Location Card** page, use the **Warehouse Pick** page to handle the pick. Warehouse picks are similar to inventory picks. The difference is that rather than posting the picking information you register the pick. This registration doesn't post consumption, it just makes the items available for posting. As a warehouse manager, you can use a pick worksheet to organize pick information before creating the individual warehouse pick instructions

## To review planning lines for a project ledger entry

After you have posted project journal lines, you can see the planning lines that are associated with the project journal entries that have been posted.

> [!NOTE]  
> This requires that the **Apply Usage Link** check box has been selected for the project. For more information, see [Set up projects](projects-how-setup-jobs.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a relevant project journal, and then choose the **Ledger Entries** action.  
3. On the **Project Ledger Entries** page, choose **Show Linked Project Planning Lines** action.

# FAQ for Sales Order Agent (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Sales Order Agent feature in Business Central.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]
<!--[!INCLUDE [limited-public-preview](includes/limited-public-preview.md)]-->

## What is the Sales Order Agent?

The Sales Order Agent is an integrated AI agent that automates the task of handling requests for sales quotes and sales orders from customers. The agent can manage the entire sales order capturing process, from receiving a customer's order by email, locating the customer among the registered customers in Business Central, checking items availability, preparing a quote with the requested items, following up with the customer on any changes needed to finalize the quote, receiving quote approval, and converting it to a sales order.

Learn more in [Process sales quotes and orders with Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-process.md).

## What are the capabilities of the Sales Order Agent?

The agent supports handling requests for sales quotes and sales orders from customers with the following capabilities:

- Agent configuration

  The agent is available directly within Business Central. You can configure and activate the agent to help your team or organization improve the sales process. For example, you can specify the users who can participate in the process of reviewing and approving the sales documents created by the agent. You can also specify the mailbox for receiving the customer requests and settings for searching your items and involving the users to review the agent's work.

  Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md).

- Task execution and interaction

  The agent operates based on its instructions and user configuration. The instructions describe its purpose, tasks, and high level considerations for how to perform the flow. These instructions are defined in the agent code and aren't visible to users. The agent uses AI to identify and carry out the steps needed to complete its task within the Business Central environment. Learn more in [Sales Order Agent overview](sales-order-agent.md).

  The agent is invoked by a built-in email dispatcher that runs as a scheduled task and monitors the company mailbox specified in the agent's configuration. The dispatcher hands over emails received from the customers to the Sales Order Agent and sends results of the agent's work, such as prepared sales quote with requested items, in response.
  
- Access and permissions

  The agent runs as its own user in Business Central and is granted access only to the necessary parts of the product. It comes with a predefined permission set and UI role (profile) that limits the parts of the product and UI elements (such as pages, fields, actions) it can access.

- Transparency and change control

  The agent seeks user intervention in specific situations, such as preparing outbound communications or providing business review and approval for key operations.

  Business Central maintains full transparency and provides control over changes made by the agent. The agent brings humans in the loop when their attention is required by issuing in-product notifications that are displayed on the role center. For example, a notification occurs before any outbound email communications to a customer, when the agent needs more details to get unblocked, or when approval for important changes.  

  For each task performed by the agent, users get a detailed timeline that shows the key steps taken by the agent and human users, including the email conversation. Users can review this information and update the values and actions the agent suggested if needed. Business Central can also display the reasoning used by the agent and citations that led to a suggested value.

## What is the intended use of the Sales Order Agent?

The Sales Order Agent is intended to handle the end-to-end sales order capturing process. This process includes:

- Taking the customer’s order by email
- Iterating on the details with the customer via email
- Checking the availability of the items
- Preparing the sales quote with the requested items
- Sending the quote to the customer for approval
- Converting the quote to a sales order upon receiving customer confirmation.

## How was the Sales Order Agent evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

We defined a set of categories and scenarios and created test cases for each as described in the following table. In total, we have a suite of 50 test cases.

|Category|Scenario|
|-|-|
|Quotes<br><br>Precise request for a quote with variations (delivery dates or not, terse/verbose request, complete or incomplete email signature) |<ul><li>Single/multi-turn with approval by customer. Up to three items.</li><li>Quote request for four or more items</li><li>Request for quote by item reference. Up to three lines.</li><li>Quote sent but not approved by customer.</li><li>Quote request from unknown customer.</li><li>Quote request for unknown item.</li></ul>|
|Information<br><br>Requests for information about items followed by a quote request|<ul><li>Single and multi-turn with quote based on information.</li><li>Request for information about unknown items.</li></ul>|

## What are the limitations of Sales Order Agent? How can users minimize the impact of the Sales Order Agent limitations when using the system?

- Languages

  - [!INCLUDE[soa-language-support](includes/soa-language-support.md)]
  - Mixed language input might result in lower-quality output because the system relies on pure string similarity, and the semantic part of the matching might not work properly.

- Emailing

  - The agent reads inbound emails via a shared inbox on Microsoft Exchange. Learn more in [Set up email](admin-how-setup-email.md). Other ways to receive email aren't supported.
  - The agent only uses the email body to get the details of the request, it doesn't process files attached to emails.  
  - Large emails might exceed the number of tokens that can be processed in one request. This condition leads the agent to trigger a request for a human to investigate (similar to how a human is requested to approve whether the agent approves an email). 
  - Email messages generated by the agent might contain incorrect information. The agent is designed to ask a human user to review and edit every outbound message if necessary.  

- Entities and data the agent can work with

  - The agent is designed to work with sales quotes and sales orders. It can't create or work with the other sales documents (such as blank orders, invoices, or credit memos) or documents in other areas of the product (such as purchase or service orders).
  - The agent doesn't create new items, contacts, or customers. It only works with the entities that are already registered in Business Central. The agent is designed to ask a human user to provide additional information or perform the task manually, when it can't find this data in Business Central.
  - The agent doesn't post documents.
  - Based on more customer requests, the agent can make changes to the sales quotes, but not to the sales orders.
  - The agent is designed to work with sales lines of type "Item", other sales line types, such as Resource, Charge (Item), Allocation Account, Fixed Asset aren't supported.
  - At this stage, the agent supports the creation of up to 15 item lines per sales document. Increasing the number of lines might result in lower-quality output.
  - How you name your products can affect agent output. For example, using cryptic abbreviations versus friendly names can reduce output quality.

- When adding items to a sales document, the use of the item's **Variant Code** isn't currently supported. It leaves the **Variant Code** field empty.

- Pricing and discounts requests

   Business Central has an advanced price/discount calculation logic, often extended by ISV solutions. Therefore, the most reliable way to get the item price is to create a sales document, for example, a quote. For this reason, the agent is designed *not* to provide or update any pricing and discount information by email. Prices and default discounts are calculated by the Business Central own business logic and included with a sales quote document. Requests for changing discounts and pricing aren't accepted by the agent. Instead, they're surfaced to the users for applying them manually. 

- Other considerations

  - Delegated administrators can't activate the agent.  
  - It's only possible to configure and use one Sales Order Agent per Business Central company.
  - The agent uses the regional settings specified by its user account.
  - While the agent can recognize and interact with the custom fields and actions introduced by customizations and ISV solutions, which are added to the agent's profile and permissions, the results might vary in quality and should be thoroughly tested. Improving reliability of working with the custom elements might require adjustments to the agent's instructions, which is currently not supported. 
  
## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

- Access control and permissions

  Like any other user in Business Central, the Sales Order Agent can be granted access exclusively to the specific parts of the product required to perform its designated tasks. The agent comes with predefined permissions and a user interface (UI) role, also known as a profile, that an administrator or configuring user can assign to the agent. This assignment restricts the agent's access to certain areas of the product. It defines the type of access (for example, whether the agent is only allowed to read specific data or also update or delete it) and determines which UI elements—such as pages, fields, actions, and FactBoxes—it can interact with.  

  We strongly encourage using the permission sets and the profile included with the Sales Order Agent, which can be assigned on the Agent card. This practice ensures that the agent only has access to the functionalities necessary for its role, enhancing both security and efficiency within the system.

  Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md).

- Transparency and notifications

  Business Central users can maintain full transparency and control over the changes made by the Sales Order Agent by using other experiences that enable them to:

  - Receive notifications on the role center that come from the agent when it requires help or when the process demands human review. For example, review is required for all inbound and outbound messages, approvals, adding missing data, and similar reasons.
  - Get a better understanding of the specific task context and history (“timeline” view), including key steps involved in it.
  - Get a detailed review of each entity created by the agent (for example, a sales quote or sales order that surfaces all changes and suggestions made by the agent within a specific task. This behavior allows humans to review and adjust changes, and then sign out on proceeding with the task.
  - Get an overview of the agent's KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) that summarize the impact of the agent's work. For example, you can get an overview of the number of sales quotes or orders created by the agent and the total number of these orders.

    Make sure you attend to the notifications raised by the agent to review and approve its work.  
- All actions done by the agent, including creating and modifying records and calling actions, carry the agent's user ID. This user ID appears in the same places and in the same way as it does with other users, such as in list views, history, posted documents, notifications, and more.  
- Approval workflows can be used to add an extra layer of control to the tasks done by the agent, as they do with other users. You can set up approval workflows to make the agent create a request for approval for a specific change, for example, to mark the quote as released. The change isn't allowed until another user approves the request. Learn more in [Use Approval Workflows](across-how-use-approval-workflows.md).

## Is this capability extensible?

Currently, this capability isn't extensible by partners.

# Purchasing

You create a purchase invoice or purchase order to record the cost of purchases and to track accounts payable. If you need to control an inventory, purchase invoices are also used to dynamically update inventory levels so that you can minimize your inventory costs and provide better customer service. The purchasing costs, including service expenses, and inventory values that result from posting purchase invoices contribute to profit figures and other financial KPIs on your Role Center.

You must use purchase orders if your purchasing process requires that you record partial receipts of an order quantity, for example, because the full quantity wasn't available at the vendor. If you sell items by delivering directly from your vendor to your customer, as a drop shipment, then you must also use purchase orders. For more information, see [Make Drop Shipments](sales-how-drop-shipment.md). In all other aspects, purchase orders work the same way as purchase invoices.

You can have purchase invoices created automatically by using the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) service to convert PDF invoices from your vendors to electronic documents, which are then converted to purchase invoices by a workflow. To use this functionality, you must first sign up for the OCR service, and then perform various setups. For more information, see [Incoming Documents](across-income-documents.md).

Products can be both inventory items and services. For more information, see [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

For all purchase processes, you can incorporate an approval workflow, for example, to require that large purchases are approved by the accounting manager. For more information, see [Use Approval Workflows](across-how-use-approval-workflows.md).

# Revalue general ledger account balances

If you use general ledger (G/L) accounts to register, balance sheet items in foreign currencies, you should revaluate the account balances before you produce financial statements. Currency exchange rates often change, and revaluation helps make your financial statements more accurate.

## Set up revaluations

You set up each account that you want to include in revaluations on the **G/L Account Card** page. You can select whether to post revaluation adjustments to realized or unrealized gains/losses accounts. Posting gains and losses during a currency exchange rate adjustment follows the normal posting routine. For example, you do it for each setup on the **Currencies** page. To learn more about exchange rate adjustments, go to [Update currency exchange rates](finance-how-update-currencies.md).

To minimize errors, in the **Source Currency Posting** field, you can set up a validation for the currencies that you want to allow to post to individual G/L accounts:

* All currencies (blank)
* Multiple currencies
* Same currency
* Local currency

## Run a revaluation

To revalue the foreign currency amounts in local currency for G/L account balances, on the **Chart of Accounts** page, use the **G/L Currency Revaluation** action to start a batch job. The batch job creates adjustment entries in the journal that you select. When you post the entries, you adjust the local currency (LCY) balance for the account. G/L account balances that always show in LCY now reflect changes to the currencies in which entries were posted. This revaluation enables you to produce a more accurate financial statement with less effort.

If you're using an additional reporting currency (ACY), the G/L revaluation entries have an ACY amount. The amount only corresponding to the LCY amount on these entries, not the ACY balance on the G/L account. If you adjust the ACY rates after you post the adjustments, run the currency exchange rate adjustment one more time to adjust all G/L entries.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> G/L account revaluation might not meet all requirements for transaction and asset registrations that need revaluation. For example, for financial instruments, securities, leased assets, or if you use them for specific or large volumes of transactions or assets. We recommend that you discuss with your auditor whether you can use the feature, and if so, how you should use it. For example, if you'll allow currencies to mix for an account, or if you need to keep a separate account for each asset you want to track.

> [!NOTE]
> Revaluation doesn’t provide the ability to apply or unapply entries, like you can with customer and vendor ledger entries. Adjustments happen on a balance per currency basis.

## Revaluate accounts vs. customer and vendor exchange rate adjustments

Revaluation simplifies the task of adjusting G/L account balances. The feature revaluates the balance per currency per G/L account much like you do for adjustments to G/L accounts that are linked to bank accounts. If you use a G/L account to track multiple assets, consider using a vendor or customer account instead.

> [!NOTE]
> G/L account revaluation might not meet all requirements for transaction and asset registrations that need revaluation. For example, for financial instruments, securities, leased assets, or if you use them for specific or large volumes of transactions or assets. We recommend that you discuss with your auditor whether you can use the feature, and if so, how you should use it. For example, if you'll allow currencies to mix for an account, or if you need to keep a separate account for each asset you want to track.

The following examples illustrate the difference between using a G/L account and using a vendor account to track the balance of two monetary assets that use a foreign currency.

**Use a G/L account**
If you're using one G/L account to track either multiple assets (for example, loans or fixed assets) in the same currency, or individual part transactions for the same asset but still in the same currency, G/L revaluation makes one entry per revaluation for the currency. This means that you can't track the adjustments related to individual assets or individual transactions for the same asset.

**Use a vendor account**
If you set up multiple assets as vendors and you post transactions to them, either in same or different currencies, you'll get an adjustment per currency per vendor. Or, if you turn on the **Posting per entry** toggle on the **Adjust Currency Exchange Rate** job queue entry, you'll get an adjustment entry for each separate vendor ledger entry.

This difference is important when you assess whether G/L revaluation is the right feature to you for your reporting needs.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend that you ask your accountant or auditor which type of account is best for your business. Also, there might be an app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps?page=1&product=dynamics-365-business-central) that's just right for your business scenarios.

# Delete cost budget entries

You use the **Delete Cost Budget Entries** batch job to cancel cost budget entries from the cost budget register.  

To prevent any gaps in the cost budget entries and cost register entries, you can't delete a single entry or a batch of entries in the middle of the list of register entries.  

## To delete a cost budget entry  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Cost Budget Entries**, and then choose the related link.  

    The **To Register No.** field contains the last register entry number and can't be changed.  

    You can use the **From Register No.** field to select a register entry number from which the deletion should begin.  
2. Choose the **OK** button to delete the selected cost budget entries.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To avoid an accidental deletion of cost budget entries, you can close register entries by marking the lines as **Closed** in the **Closed** field on the **Cost Budget Registers** page.

# Create recurring purchase lines

If you often need to create purchase lines with similar information, you can set up standard lines that you can then insert on recurring purchase documents, for example, for recurring replenishment orders.

## Set up recurring purchase lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring Purchase Lines**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Recurring Purchase Lines** page, choose the **New** action.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, enter the information in the fields that reflect the standard lines you expect to use as recurring lines on purchase documents.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot define prices on recurring purchase lines because prices, discounts, etc. are calculated on the actual purchase documents after you insert the recurring purchase lines.

[!INCLUDE [line-no-info](includes/line-no-info.md)]

## Assign recurring purchase lines to a vendor

Assign one or more recurring purchase lines to a vendor so that they're available to insert on purchase documents from that vendor.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for a relevant vendor.
3. Choose the **Recurring Purchase Lines** action.
4. On the **Recurring Purchase Lines** page, select codes for the recurring purchase lines that you want to be able to insert on purchase documents for the vendor.
5. Fill in the other fields to define when, how, and where the recurring purchase lines are to be used.
6. In the four fields where you select how the lines are inserted on each document type, select one of the following options:

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Manual**|You must manually look up and insert a recurring purchase line that exists for the vendor.|
|**Automatic**|If multiple recurring purchase lines exist for the vendor, you'll get a notification from where you can pick which one to insert. If only one recurring purchase line exists, it will be inserted automatically.<br /><br />This only works if the new document was created from a document list, for example by choosing the **New** action on the **Purchase Orders** page. It doesn't work if the document was created from a vendor card, for example.|
|**Always Ask**|A notification appears and all existing recurring purchase lines are shown so that you can select one.

## Insert recurring purchase lines on a purchase invoice

If recurring purchase lines exist for the vendor, you can insert them, or have them automatically added, on all types of purchase documents, such as a purchase invoice. If you have activated the **Always Ask** options while assigning recurring purchase lines to vendors, you'll be informed if recurring purchase lines exist.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the purchase invoice that you want to insert one or more standard purchase lines on.
3. Choose the **Get Recurring Purchase Lines** action.
4. On the **Recurring Purchase Lines** page, choose the lookup button in the **Code** field, and then select a set of standard purchase lines.
5. Choose the **OK** button to insert the standard purchase lines on the invoice where you can reuse them as is or edit the information.

# Sign up for a free Dynamics 365 Business Central trial

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a free trial. There are two ways to access the trial version, depending on your location. If you are in a country where Microsoft offers official localization, you can follow one path. If you are in a country where localization is handled by partners, you'll need to follow a different path. Explore the different types of localization [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). After a quick sign-up, you'll have access to many of the app's key features. The trial allows you to test the app with sample data. If you want to try out things with your own data, you'll switch to a free 30-day trial. [Learn more about Business Central features](across-business-functionality.md).  

## Start the trial in Microsoft-based localizations 

You can find your free [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] trial on the **[Dynamics 365 Business Central product](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/products/business-central)** page. You just need to follow the steps and you'll get trial localized version tailored for your location. If you want eventually to try different localization, you can do it in the sandbox. 

<!--## To sign up for the trial-->

[!INCLUDE [trial-get](includes/trial-get.md)]

## Start with the trial in location with partner-based localizations  

In countries where Microsoft doesn't offer built-in localization, obtaining a localized version by default isn't possible due to localization being managed by partners. Consequently, Microsoft can only provide the standard base app, typically without localization or translation. To avoid confusion not offering all local requirements and the language, we have different path of getting trial version, so you can have full local experience.  

You can get your trial version following these steps:

1. You must run "Find your partner" on [Microsoft web site](https://partner.microsoft.com/partnership/find-a-partner) or ask local Microsoft office for advice. 
2. Microsoft can help you find a partner for you or you might have already found a partner based on your experience. 
3. You might offer your partner for the trial version and then partner goes to CSP.  
   1. Finds or adds customer tenant.   
   2. Assigns the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Trial SKU in CSP. 
   3. Assigns the localization and translation, and eventually assigns translated demo data to the created tenant. 
   4. Sends customer link to the environment.   
   5. The test trial environment will be accessible. 

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft doesn't oversee how partners set up the trial environment or what specific elements are included. While Microsoft offers recommendations, partners have the flexibility to implement them in their own way. Using a trial version from one partner doesn't obligate you to purchase a license from them, and you can always choose to switch partners at any time.  

## What to try

Your trial environment includes the same features as the paid version. The links below guide you through some of the key features.

- [Get started](ui-get-ready-business.md#get-started)  
- [Get productive](ui-work-product.md)  
- [Quick starts](quick-start-business-central.md)  

## Get started with a subscription

Each time you sign in during the trial period, a notification in a blue bar at the top displays the time remaining. If you decide to subscribe, find a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner. For more information, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](/dynamics365/business-central/across-faq#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner). The reselling partner can help you set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to fit your business, including importing your data from your previous system. You can also customize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by adding apps from [the Microsoft commercial marketplace](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646).  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online uses Microsoft 365. If your company uses a different type of email setup, the reselling partner can help you decided how to migrate, or if you should use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.  

You can also contact the [[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Sales team](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=828707).

# General Journal Post Line Overview

Codeunit 12, **Gen. Jnl.-Post Line**, is the major application object for general ledger posting and is the only place to insert general ledger, VAT, and customer and vendor ledger entries. This codeunit is also used for all Apply, Unapply and Reverse operations.  
  
In Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013 R2, the codeunit was redesigned because it had become very large, with approximately 7,600 code lines. The architecture was changed and the codeunit has been made simpler and more maintainable. This documentation describes the changes and provides information that you will need for upgrade.  
  
## Old Architecture  
The old architecture had the following features:  
  
* There was extensive use of global variables, which increased the possibility of hidden errors due to use of variables with the wrong scope.  
* There were many long procedures (with more than 100 code lines) that also had high cyclomatic complexity (that is, a lot of CASE, REPEAT, IF nested statements), which made the code very difficult to read and maintain.  
* Several procedures that were only used locally and were only meant to be used locally were not marked as local.  
* Most procedures had no parameters and used global variables. Some used parameters and overrode global variables with locals.  
* Code patterns for searching the general ledger accounts and creating general ledger and VAT entries was not standardized and varied from place to place. In addition, there was a lot of code duplication and broken symmetry between customer and vendor code.  
* A large part of the code in codeunit 12, approximately 30 percent, related to payment discount and tolerance calculations, although these features are not needed in many countries or regions.  
* Posting, Apply, Unapply, Reverse, Payment Discount and Tolerance, and Exchange Rate Adjustment were married together in codeunit 12 using a long list of global variables.  
  
### New Architecture  
In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], codeunit 12 has had the following improvements:  
  
* Codeunit 12 has been refactored into smaller procedures (all less than 100 code lines).  
* Standardized patterns for the search of general ledger accounts have been implemented by using helper functions from Posting Group tables.  
* A Posting Engine Framework has been implemented to manage the start and finish of transactions and to isolate the creation to general ledger and VAT entries, the collection of VAT adjustment, and the calculation of additional currency amounts.  
* Code duplication has been eliminated.  
* Many helper functions have been transferred to corresponding customer and vendor ledger entry tables.  
* The use of global variables has been minimized, so that each procedure uses parameters and encapsulates its own application logic.

# Defer revenues and expenses

To recognize a revenue or an expense in a period other than the period in which the transaction was posted, you can automatically defer revenues and expenses over a specified schedule.

To distribute revenues or expenses on the involved accounting periods, you set up a deferral template for the resource, item, or G/L account that the revenue or expense will be posted for. When you post the related sales or purchase document, the revenue or expense are deferred to the involved accounting periods, according to a deferral schedule that is governed by settings in the deferral template and the posting date.

> [!NOTE]
> Sales and purchase journals validate the source code. The validation requires that the source code for sales and sales journals, and purchase and purchase journals respectively, aren't identical when you're using deferrals. If it's set up to be identical, you can work around this limitation by creating a template and batch that use another source code.

## To set up a G/L account for deferral

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary to create a G/L account for deferred revenues. For more information, see [The General Ledger and the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md).
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to create a new G/L account for deferred expenses.

For both types of deferral, select **Balance Sheet** in the **Type** field, and name the accounts appropriately, such as "Unearned Income" for deferred revenues and "Unpaid Expenses" for deferred expenses.

## To set up a deferral template

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Deferral Templates**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.
4. In the **Calc. Method** field, specify how the **Amount** field for each period on the **Deferral Schedule** page is calculated. You can choose between the following options:

   * **Straight-Line**: The periodic deferral amounts are calculated according to the number of periods, distributed according to period length.
   * **Equal per Period**: The periodic deferral amounts are calculated according to the number of periods, distributed evenly on periods.
   * **Days per Period**: The periodic deferral amounts are calculated according to the number of days in the period.
   * **User-Defined**: The periodic deferral amounts aren't calculated. You must manually fill the **Amount** field for each period in the Deferral Schedule page. For more information, see the “To change a deferral schedule from a sales invoice” section.
5. In the **Period Desc.** field, specify a description that will be shown on entries for the deferral posting. You can enter the following placeholder codes for typical values, which will be inserted automatically when the period description is displayed.

   * %1 = The day number of the period posting date
   * %2 = The week number of the period posting date
   * %3 = The month number of the period posting date
   * %4 = The month name of the period posting date
   * %5 = The accounting period name of the period posting date
   * %6 = The fiscal year of the period posting date

Example: The posting date is 02/06/2016. If you enter “Expenses deferred for %4 %6”, then the description displayed will be "Expenses deferred for February 2016".

## To assign a deferral template to an item

> [!NOTE]  
> The steps in this procedure are the same as when you assign a deferral template to a G/L account or a resource.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the item for which revenues or expenses must be deferred to the accounting periods when the item was sold or purchased.
3. On the **Costs & Posting** FastTab, in the **Default Deferral Template** field, select the relevant deferral template.

## To change a deferral schedule from a sales invoice

> [!NOTE]  
> The steps in this procedure are the same as when you change a deferral schedule, for expenses, from a purchase invoice.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a sales invoice for an item that has a deferral template assigned. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).

    Notice that as soon as you enter the item (or resource or G/L account) on the invoice line, the **Deferral Code** field is filled with the code of the assigned deferral template.
3. Choose the **Deferral Schedule** action.
4. On the **Deferral Schedule** page, change settings on the header or values on the lines, for example to defer the amount to an additional accounting period.
5. Choose the **Calculate Schedule** action.
6. Choose the **OK** button. The deferral schedule is updated for the sales invoice. The related deferral template is unchanged.

## To preview how deferred revenues or expenses will be posted to the general ledger

> [!NOTE]  
> The steps in this procedure are the same as when you preview how expense deferrals are posted.

1. On the **Sales Invoice** page, choose the **Preview Posting** action.
2. On the **Posting Preview** page, choose the **G/L Entry** action, and then choose the **Show Related Entries** action.

G/L entries to be posted to the specified deferral account, for example, Unearned Income, are denoted by the description that you entered in the **Period Desc.** field in the deferral template, for example, "Expenses deferred for February 2016".

## To review posted deferrals in the Sales Deferral Summary report

> [!NOTE]  
> The steps in this procedure are the same as when you review the Purchasing Deferral Summary report.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Deferral Summary**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Sales Deferral Summary** page, in the **Balance as of** field, enter the date up to which you want to see deferred revenues.
3. Choose the **Preview** button.

## To specify a period in which to allow deferral posting

You can specify a period in which people can post transactions by entering dates in the **Allow Posting From** and **Allow Posting To** fields as follows:

* For all users, on the **General Ledger Setup** page
* For specific users, on the **User Setup** page

If you've done that, you must make an exception for deferrals to allow them to be posted outside the period. To define the period, follow these steps.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup** or **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Allow Deferral Posting From** and **Allow Deferral Posting To** fields, enter a start and end date for the period.

### Video guidance

The following video shows how to define the period in which you allow people to post deferred revenue and expenses, and how to specify exceptions.

# Access with Microsoft 365 Licenses FAQ

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-short](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-short.md)]

Users can access Business Central data in Microsoft Teams using their Microsoft 365 license. This article answers frequently asked questions from administrators, consultants and others. Developers should refer to the Developer FAQ. For questions about integrating Business Central with Microsoft Teams, go to [Teams FAQ](teams-faq.md).

## [Permissions](#tab/permissions) 

### Can I proactively configure different starting permissions for different groups of users?

Not at this time. Business Central only allows configuring one group of permissions that are assigned to all Microsoft 365 users when they sign into Business Central for the first time.

### Can I proactively configure permissions, profiles, and settings for individual users before they sign in?

Yes. It can be achieved through security groups. By applying a security group to an environment, you define the total set of users that have access to that environment. This security group can include users with a Business Central license and users with a Microsoft 365 license. When you next update users from Microsoft 365 in the **Users** list, the Microsoft 365 user records will be created. You can then assign user groups, permissions, profiles, and other settings before they've signed in.

### After a user signs in, can I change which objects they have access to?

Yes. After a user has signed in for the first time and their user record has been provisioned, administrators manage those users just like any other Business Central user. For example, they can add or remove permissions to different objects. If you change the permission sets assigned to the Microsoft 365 license in the License Configuration page, the change will only affect the next users that sign in for the first time.

### How do I prevent access to sensitive tables?

Business Central offers a powerful and flexible permission model where administrators can define permission sets that grant access to specific objects, business processes or entire roles. To prevent access to sensitive tables, you can create custom permission sets that exclude permission to sensitive objects. For more information about exclude permissions, see [Create a permission set](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).  

### Instead of customizing the License Configuration, can I customize a user group?

Yes. Adding permission sets to the Microsoft Teams Internal Users user group in Business Central, has the same net effect as adding permission sets to the Microsoft 365 license, as long as the Microsoft 365 license continues to map to this user group. This approach has the added benefit that permission sets are always synchronized with members of the group whenever you modify the user group.

### When a Business Central user shares a record in Teams, do they grant new permissions?

No. This action isn't the same as sharing a link to a SharePoint document where the person sharing the document can choose to grant permission to others. In Business Central, only administrators can configure and assign permissions. When compared to sharing SharePoint documents, it's the equivalent of choosing the option to “Share to people with existing access”.

### Does this feature support row-level security?

Yes. Even though a person accessing a record in Teams with their Microsoft 365 license may have the correct table and page object permissions, row-level permissions will be enforced if it' been implemented for that table.  

### If I configure permissions that include write access, will users be able to write in Teams?

If you configure Business Central to assign a permission set that includes insert, modify, or delete access to one or more objects, users with that permission set will still not be able to write in Teams when they only have a Microsoft 365 license. The Business Central service enforces read-only access no matter what insert, modify, or delete permission you assign.  

Even though Business Central provides this level of protection, we still recommend that you avoid permission sets with write access. Doing so prevents issues further downstream when users change role or acquire new licenses.  

## [Setup and Configuration](#tab/setup)

### Why is the setting to enable access not available for my environment?

Enabling access with Microsoft 365 licenses is only available for Business Central environments of platform version 21.1 or later. When your environment is upgraded to this minimum version, the setting automatically becomes available. To check the version of your environment, go to the environment details page for the environment in the Business Central admin center. Or, sign in to the environment, and go to the **Help & Support** page from the **Help** menu.

### Can I access Business Central on premises with Microsoft 365 licenses?

No, it's not supported. Business Central displays an error when users try to access Business Central on premises records in Teams.

### What is the Employee profile?

The **Employee** profile displayed in the **Profiles (Roles)** list page was introduced with Update 21.1. It's the default profile assigned to users that access Business Central with their Microsoft 365 license. This profile's intended for people in an organization who don't have a specific role in Business Central and only need to view data that was shared with them.

### What is the Teams Users user group?

The **Microsoft Teams Internal Users** group displayed in the **User Groups** page was introduced with Update 21.1. This group is the default user group assigned to users that access Business Central with their Microsoft 365 license. The user group's intended for people within the same organization where Business Central is hosted that collaborate in Microsoft Teams.  

### Do users that only have a Microsoft 365 license show up in the Users list in Business Central?

Yes. If you apply security groups to environments, those users will show up in the Users list after you use the Update Users from Microsoft 365 action from the **Users** list. If you don't apply security groups, user records appear in the Users list after the first time they access a Business Central record.

### Does this feature work for embed ISV solutions?

Yes. Users with only a Microsoft 365 license can also access records in environments that run under the *.bc.dynamics.com domain.

## [Licensing](#tab/license)

### Can a customer use this feature if they don't have Business Central?

Accessing Business Central with a Microsoft 365 license is intended for organizations that already subscribe to Business Central and operate one or more Business Central environments with licensed Business Central users. It provides no new functionality or use rights to Microsoft 365 customers that don't have a Business Central plan.

### How does this help me manage subscription costs in my organization?

To maximize productivity and streamline their operations, SMBs often purchase Dynamics 365 Business Central together with Microsoft 365. In which case, most people receive a Microsoft 365 license, but only specific roles or people receive a Business Central license. Business Central provides licensing flexibility so that customers pay only for what they need:

- Users requiring full access to Business Central are typically assigned a Business Central Essentials or Business Central Premium license. 
- Users requiring limited write access are typically assigned a Business Central Team Member license.
- All other employees across the organization that only need to occasionally read business data that is shared with them, can do so if they have a Microsoft 365 license. They don't have to be assigned a Team Member license. Other licensing options are available. For more information, download and read the [Dynamics 365 licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).

### Is this 100% free of charge?
 
No. Accessing Business Central data in Microsoft Teams requires each user to have either a Business Central license or a Microsoft 365 license from the list of supported plans.

### Does this work with Microsoft 365 trials and Business Central trials?

Yes. If a user is assigned a Microsoft 365 license from a trial of a supported plan, they can also access Business Central records in Teams. It's then possible for customers to try Microsoft productivity and business apps working together, and allows partner salespeople and consultants to easily demonstrate this feature. For example, partners can provision their own Microsoft Entra tenants from [https://aka.ms/CDX](https://aka.ms/CDX) that include Microsoft 365 trials and Business Central trials for demonstrating Business Central.

### The list of licenses in Business Central shows a Microsoft 365 license. What's that?

The **License Configuration** page in Business Central displays the different types of licenses that can provide access to the Business Central service. In version 21, Microsoft added Microsoft 365 to this list as a new way to access Business Central. This list of licenses doesn't imply that your organization has purchased subscriptions to any of these licenses or your organization has enabled access through those licenses.

### Do I need to acquire a new type of Microsoft 365 license for this feature to work?  

Microsoft hasn't created new licenses or new plans to power this feature. This feature relies entirely on existing Microsoft 365 plans and licenses. If you already subscribe to one of the supported Microsoft 365 plans, then you already have this new use right. Learn more about the supported plans in [Business Central access with Microsoft 365 licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md#requirements-for-individual-users-to-access-data-in-teams). Otherwise, if you don't subscribe to Microsoft 365 today, you can sign up for Microsoft 365 Business Premium or similar plan. Learn more in [Try or buy a Microsoft 365 for business subscription](/microsoft-365/commerce/try-or-buy-microsoft-365).

### How do I find out which users have only a Microsoft 365 license?

There are multiple ways. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to the **Active Users** list and refer to the **Licenses** column. In Business Central, go to the **Users** list, choose any of the users and view the **Licenses** FactBox.  

### How do I filter the Users list in Business Central to see users that only have a Microsoft 365 license?

This task is currently not possible using a filter or list view. However, you can select a user in the list and view the Licenses FactBox that will include only Microsoft 365, if the user only has a Microsoft 365 license.

### What about users that have both a Microsoft 365 license and a Business Central license?

When multiple licenses are assigned to a user, the greater license use rights win over lesser license use rights when accessing Business Central. In this case, Business Central license entitles the user to more user rights. So, users can read and write Business Central records in Teams and access the Business Central web client in the browser, just like any other Business Central license-holder. If specific permission sets have been configured for the Microsoft 365 license, the user gets the configured permission sets combined with the permission sets from the Business Central license or that have already been assigned to the user.

### Is this licensing related to the Business Central Team Member license?

There's no relation between Business Central Team Member licenses and accessing Business Central in Microsoft Teams using Microsoft 365 licenses. Although Microsoft Teams and its documentation refer to people in a team as *team members*, it's a collective term for a group of Microsoft Teams users. It doesn't refer to Business Central licenses.

### Does Business Central enforce any of the constraints?

Yes, all of the platform constraints and minimum requirements, including licensing requirements, are enforced by the Business Central platform. This guides users with specific error messages to help them troubleshoot their setup, and prevent abuse. For example, if a user that only has a Microsoft 365 license attempts to access the Business Central web client in the browser, access will be denied and a guiding error message will be displayed. 

## [Usage](#tab/usage)
 
### Can I access records on Teams for iOS and Teams for Android? 

Currently, it isn't possible to access Business Central data on the Teams mobile using only a Microsoft 365 license. Microsoft is working on enabling this capability shortly. 

### How do users change their personal settings in My Settings? 

When a user accesses Business Central for the first time using only their Microsoft 365 license, their user settings such as language, time zone and regional settings are automatically set based on their operating system or browser settings. Administrators can modify these settings from Business Central for each user. 

### What determines the choice of language when you sign in for the first time? 

The language with which you experience Business Central is set based on various factors, including the Teams client through which you accessed Business Central the first time. For Teams desktop app, Teams for iOS and Teams for Android, the operating system language is applied. For Teams for the web, the browser language is applied. In all cases, the Teams language isn't considered. 

### Why can’t I activate some of the colored links in tabs and card details?

Actionable links on Business Central pages are often shown as a bold hyperlinks that can be activated to go elsewhere or run some operation. At a technical level, these links are typically implemented as field values with no caption that trigger some code and where the choice of style often reflects state. When users access Business Central pages with their Microsoft 365 license, the links are styled as if they're actionable. But they can't be activated because this license doesn't offer use rights to run actions.  

### Why can’t I activate page notification actions?

Contextual notifications shown on pages are often accompanied by actionable links. When users access Business Central pages with their Microsoft 365 license, these links are displayed, but can't be activated because this license doesn't offer use rights to run actions. At a technical level, these links are implemented as actions.

### Can Microsoft 365 users remove tabs?

Yes. Anyone in the chat or channel can remove tabs created by others. Removing a tab doesn't remove or affect data in Business Central, but the tab will be removed for all users in the chat or channel.

### If I can't filter, will I still see a filtered list that was created by others?

Users accessing Business Central with their Microsoft 365 license don't have the use rights to filter using the filter pane or apply list views. But, if another user has created a tab containing a filtered list page, Microsoft 365 users will also view those filters applied to the tab.

# Set up reminder terms and levels

You can use reminders to inform customers about overdue amounts and to request payment. [!INCLUDE [reminder-terms](includes/reminder-terms.md)]

> [!TIP]
> After you set up reminder terms and levels, you can include them in automated processes for creating, issuing, and sending reminders. To learn more about the automated process, go to [Automate reminders in collections](finance-automate-reminders.md).

## Reminder terms

If customers have overdue payments, you must decide when and how to send a reminder. In addition, you might want to debit their accounts for interest or fees. You can set up any number of reminder terms.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to calculate interest on overdue payments, you can do so when you create reminders. If, however, you just want to calculate interest and inform your customers about this without sending a reminder, use a [finance charge memo](finance-setup-finance-charges.md). For more information, see [Reminders](receivables-collect-outstanding-balances.md#reminders) or [Finance Charges](receivables-collect-outstanding-balances.md#finance-charges).

### Set up attachment and email body texts for communications

On the **Reminder Terms Setup** page, you can set up attachment texts and standard email messages to use either for all reminder levels, or create specific messages for each level. For example, the message you send for the first reminder level might have a different tone or content than the second or third. To create attachment and email message texts for all levels, choose **Customer Communication** at the top of the page. To create messages for specific lines, on the **Reminder Level** FastTab, choose a line and then choose the **Customer Communication** action on the FastTab.

By default, attachment and email texts use your language setting. If you issue reminders to customers in other countries, however, you might want to communicate in different languages. You can create texts for each language that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports by using the **Add text for language** action. If you do, ensure that the languages are the same for attachment texts and email texts. If they don't match, and the reminder term has more than one level, the automation might not be able to customize the message for one or more levels. To verify that the languages match, use the **Overview communications** action and compare the communications for the texts.

When you send an email, the reminder is a report you attach to the email. You define the report that generates the reminder on the **Report Selection Reminder/Finance Charge** page, where you also select the report that holds the email body text in the **Email Body Layout Name** field. When you send emails to your customers, the texts on the **Email Text** FastTab are inserted in the report selected in the **Email Body Layout Name** field. The standard report has a text field for this text. If you want, you can edit this report, for example, to add or remove content. Edit the layout of these reports on the **Report Layouts** page. To learn more about report layouts, go to [Get Started Creating Report Layouts](ui-get-started-layouts.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Communicating by email directly from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] requires that you're set up to do that. To learn more about connecting email accounts with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], go to [Set up email](admin-how-setup-email.md).

### Set up reminder terms

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Reminder Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. To use more than one combination of reminder terms, set up a code for each one.

## Reminder levels

For each reminder term, you can define an unlimited number of reminder levels, though most companies use only two or three levels. The first time a reminder is created for a customer, the setting from level 1 is used. When the reminder is issued, the level number is registered on the reminder entries that are created and linked to the individual customer ledger entries. If it's necessary to remind the customer again, all reminder entries linked to open customer ledger entries are checked to locate the highest level number. The conditions from the next level number will then be used for the new reminder.

If you create more reminders than you define levels for, the conditions for the highest level are used. You can create as many reminders as are allowed by the **Max. No of Reminders** field in the reminder terms.

### To set up reminder levels

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Reminder Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Reminder Terms** page, select the line with the terms you want to set up levels for, and then choose the **Levels** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    > [!TIP]
    > The setting of the **Calculate Interest** field determines if interest will appear on the reminder when the reminder is issued. However, the **Post Interest** field in the **Reminder Terms** page determines if the calculated interest must be posted to G/L and customer accounts.
    >
    > To indicate that interest should be calculated, choose the **Calculate Interest** field.

    Optionally, for each reminder level, specify extra fees in both local and foreign currencies. You can define many extra fees in foreign currencies for each code on the **Reminder Levels** page.  

    The extra fees can be calculated in three different ways that are defined by the value of the **Add. Fee Calculation Type** field.  

    - **Fixed**

        Fees are calculated based on the values of the **Additional Fee** fields on the line for the reminder level itself.  
    - **Single Dynamic**

        Fees are calculated based on the values of the fields on the relevant line in the **Additional Fee Setup** page for that reminder level.
    - **Accumulated Dynamic**

        Fees are calculated based on the values of the fields on the combined lines in the **Additional Fee Setup** page for that reminder level.

4. Choose the **Currencies** action.
5. On the **Currencies for Reminder Levels** page, define for each reminder level code and corresponding reminder level number a currency code and an extra fee.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you create reminders in a foreign currency, the foreign currency conditions that you set up here will be used to create reminders. If there are no foreign currency reminder conditions set up, the LCY reminder conditions that are set up on the **Reminder Levels** page will be used and then converted to the relevant currency.

    For each reminder level, you can specify text that will be printed before (**Beginning Text**) or after (**Ending Text**) on the entries on the reminder.

6. Choose the **Beginning Text** or **Ending Text** actions respectively, and fill in the **Reminder Text** page.
7. To automatically insert related values in the reminder text, you can enter the following placeholders in the **Text** field.  

    |Placeholder|Value|  
    |-----------------|-----------|  
    |%1|Content of the **Document Date** field on the reminder header|  
    |%2|Content of the **Due Date** field on the reminder header|  
    |%3|Content of the **Interest Rate** field on the related finance charge terms|  
    |%4|Content of the **Remaining Amount** field on the reminder header|  
    |%5|Content of the **Interest Amount** field on the reminder header|  
    |%6|Content of the **Additional Fee** field on the reminder header|  
    |%7|The total amount of the reminder|  
    |%8|Content of the **Reminder Level** field on the reminder header|  
    |%9|Content of the **Currency Code** field on the reminder header|  
    |%10|Content of the **Posting Date** field on the reminder header|  
    |%11|The company name|  
    |%12|Content of the **Add. Fee per Line** field on the reminder header|  

    For example, if you write **You owe %9 %7 due on %2.**, the reminder contains the following text: **You owe USD 1.200,50 due on 02-02-2024.**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the due date according to the date formula that you enter. For more information, see [Use Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas).

8. To specify the language for an email message, choose the **Add text for language** action. The **Language Code** field updates to show your selection. On the **Email Text** FastTab, enter the content of the message in the selected language.

After you set up the reminder terms, you can assign them to customers on Customer Card pages. For more information, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).

# Add Comments to Cards and Documents

You can add extra information to G/L accounts, customers cards, or sales orders to communicate exceptions or special agreements to other users.
Practically all cards and document have a **Comments** action, which opens the **Comment Sheet** page where you can write or read comments. On documents, you can also add comments to individual lines.

Comments on ongoing documents are transferred to the related posted document. For example, a comment on a sales order is transferred to a resulting posted sales shipment.

In addition, you can specify if you want comments to be transferred from one type of document to another resulting type of document, such as from a sales order to a sales invoice. You do this in the **Sales & Receivables** and the **Purchases & Payables** pages respectively.

> [!NOTE]
> Comments are not printed or output to reports or externally-facing documents.

The following describes how to add a comment to an item card. The steps are similar for all other cards and documents, except on document lines, the **Comments** action is placed on a lines action menu.

## To add a comments to an item card

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant item card.
3. Choose the **Comments** action.
4. On the **Comment Sheet** page, enter any text, and then choose the **OK** button.

# Manage product variants

Item variants are a great way to keep your list of products under control. For example, you have a large number of items that are almost identical and vary only in color. You can define each variant as a separate item. But you can also choose to set up one item and specify the various colors as variants of the item.  

> [!TIP]
> For a practical introduction to using variants in production, see [Walkthrough: Variants](contoso-coffee/manufacturing/variants.md) for the Contoso Coffee demo data.  

## Add variants to an item

It's easy enough to define variants for an item.  

### To add variants

1. Open [the **Items List** page](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=31), open the relevant item.  
2. On the **Item** card, choose the **Related** action, then choose **Item**, and then choose the **Variants** action.  
3. On the **Item Variants** page, list the variants.  

Then, when you create a sales document and add the item, you can specify the variant of the item in the Variant **Code** field. The same applies to purchasing documents.  

## Item availability by variant

[!INCLUDE [inventory_variant-availability](includes/inventory_variant-availability.md)]

## Require use of variants

Starting in 2022 release wave 2, admins can require that users specify the variant in documents and journals for items that have variants. To activate the capability, on the **Inventory Setup** page, and select the **Variant Mandatory if Exists** field. You can override this global setting for specific items.  

On item cards, the **Variant Mandatory if Exists** field has the following options:

|Field value |Description|
|---------|----|
|Default (No)| The setting from **Inventory Setup** applies to this item.|
|No| Users aren't required to specify a variant for this item.|
|Yes| If the item has one or more variants, users must specify the relevant variant. If they don't, they're blocked from posting the transaction.|

> [!NOTE]
> These settings don't affect items that don't have variants.

If the capability is switched on, you can't post an entry if the variant isn't specified.

# Sell Items Assembled to Order

Items that are set up for assemble-to-order aren't expected to be in inventory and will be assembled when it's included on a sales order. An item is set up for assemble-to-order when the **Assembly Policy** field on the item card contains **Assemble-to-Order**. When you enter the item on a sales order line, an assembly order is automatically created and linked to the sales order.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If assemble-to-order items are already in inventory, you can deduct that quantity from the assembly order and reserve it from inventory. Learn more at [Sell Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md).  

In this procedure, you process the sale of an item that will be assembled according to specifications that are requested by the customer. The steps include: 

* Creating a sales order line.
* Customizing the assembly item by editing its components and resources.
* Checking availability to establish a delivery date.
* Releasing the sales order to be assembled and immediately shipped.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedure does not include the steps for creating a standard sales order that happen before the step where you enter the assemble-to-order item on a sales order line. Learn more about creating sales orders at [Sell Products with a Customer Sales Order](sales-how-sell-products.md).  

## To sell an item that is assembled to order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a sales order. 
3. In the **No.** field, enter an item that is set up to be assembled to order.  
4. In the **Location Code** field, define which location the item will be sold from. The assembly process will occur at that location.  
5. In the **Quantity** field, enter how many units to sell.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If one or more components of the requested assembly item quantity aren't available, an availability warning page opens. <!-- Check whether the field help would be useful. For more information, see Assembly Availability.  -->

    An assembly order is created and linked to the sales order line. The due date of the assembly order is the shipment date of the sales order line.  

    The quantity to sell is copied to the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field, which indicates that the item setup expects you'll assemble the full quantity on the sales line. You can decrease the quantity to assemble, for example, if you know that some items are already available. Learn more at [Sell Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows](assembly-how-to-sell-inventory-items-in-assemble-to-order-flows.md).  

6. If the customer wants an additional item in a kit, on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, choose the **Assemble to Order** action, and then choose the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** action to view and change the standard assembly components. Alternatively, choose the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field.  
7. On the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page, create a new line of type **Item** for the additional assembly component.  

    You can also customize the order by increasing the quantity of one standard item in the kit. You can do this by increasing the value in the **Quantity Per** field on the specific assembly order line.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page only contains the basic fields for customizing the component list, adding item tracking numbers, or solving component availability issues. To add more assembly order information, such as the assembly order starting date, choose the **Show Documents** action. This opens a full view of the assembly order that is linked to the sales order line. You can't change the contents of most fields on the assembly order header, and you can't post assembly output from it. You must post the shipment of the sales order line.  
    >
    >  On the linked assembly orders, only the **Starting Date** field can be changed. Changing the starting date lets assembly workers specify that they're starting assembly earlier than the due date. All fields on the lines of the linked assembly order can be changed so that warehouse workers can enter consumption figures during the process.  

8. Review or react to component availability issues. For example, select a substitute item.  
9. Close the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page. The linked assembly order is ready, and workers can start to assemble the customized items.  
10. On the sales order, choose the **Release** action to notify the assembly department that the assembly process can start. Learn more at [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Item substitutions don't automatically replace an item with another item, for example, when creating a sales order or in a BOM. Instead, you'll be alerted to the fact that a substitution is available.

# Send Electronic Documents

> [!NOTE]
> The content in this article is only applicable for versions of Dynamics 365 Business Central that were released before 2023 release wave 2. In 2023 release wave 2, new functionality for E-Documents is included. To learn more, see [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md).  

The generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports sending electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format, a format that the largest document exchange service providers support. A document exchange service provider dispatches electronic documents between trading partners. To provide support for other electronic document formats, you use the data exchange framework.  

 In the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a document exchange service is preconfigured and ready to be set up for your company. For more information, see [Set Up a Document Exchange Service](across-how-to-set-up-a-document-exchange-service.md). However, in some cases, you must install an app. For more information, see [Electronic Invoicing FAQ](faq-electronic-invoicing.yml).  

 To send a sales invoice as an electronic PEPPOL document, you select the **Electronic Document** option in the **Post and Send** dialog box. You can also set up the customer's default document sending profile from that dialog box. First, you must set up various master data, such as company information, customers, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when converting data in fields in [Set Up Electronic Document Sending and Receiving](across-how-to-set-up-electronic-document-sending-and-receiving.md).  

### To send an electronic sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Create a new sales invoice.  

3. When the sales invoice is ready to be invoiced, choose the **Post and Send** action.  

     If the customer's default sending profile is **Electronic Document**, then it will be shown in the **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box. This way, you just have to choose the **Yes** button to post and send the invoice electronically in the selected format.  

4. In the **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box, choose the AssistEdit button to the right of the **Send Document to** field.  

5. In the **Send Document to** dialog box, in the **Electronic Document** field, choose **Through Document Exchange Service**.  

6. In the **Format** field, choose **PEPPOL**.  

7. Choose the **OK** button. The **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box appears. **Electronic Document (PEPPOL)** is added to the **Send Document to** field.  

8. Choose the **Yes** button.  

     The sales invoice is posted and sent to the customer in the PEPPOL format.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can also send a posted sales invoice as an electronic document. The procedure is the same as described in this topic for non-posted sales documents. On the **Posted Sales Invoice** page, choose the **Activity Log** action to view the status of the electronic document.

# Delivery date calculation for sales

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically calculates the earliest possible date that an item on a sales order line can be shipped.

* If the customer has requested a specific delivery date, then the date on which the items must be available to pick to meet that delivery date is calculated.
* If the customer doesn't request a specific delivery date, then the date on which the items can be delivered is calculated. The calculation starts from the date on which the items are available for picking.

## Calculating a requested delivery date

If you specify a requested delivery date on the sales order line, that date becomes the starting point for the following calculations.

- *requested delivery date - shipping time = planned shipment date*
- *planned shipment date - outbound whse. handling time = shipment date*

If the items are available to pick on the shipment date, then the sales process can continue. Otherwise, a stock-out warning is displayed.

> [!NOTE]
> If your process is based on backward calculation, for example, if you use the requested delivery date to get the planned shipment date, we recommend you use date formulas with fixed durations, such as "5D" for five days or "1W" for one week. Date formulas without fixed durations, such as "CW" for current week or CM for current month, can result in incorrect date calculations. Learn more about date formulas at [Work with Calendar Dates and Times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

## Calculating the earliest possible delivery date

If you don't specify a requested delivery date on the sales order line, or if the requested delivery date can't be met, then the earliest date on which the items are available is calculated. That date is then entered in the **Shipment Date** field on the line, and the date on which you plan to ship the items and the date on which they'll be delivered to the customer are calculated using the following formulas.

- *shipment date + outbound whse. handling time = planned shipment date*
- *planned shipment date + shipping time = planned delivery date*

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]


## Assembly Header Measures
- [Qty. on Assembly Order](#qty-on-assembly-order)

### Qty. on Assembly Order
**Formula**  
- This measure shows how many items are yet to be assembled for assembly orders by summing up the remaining quantity of items on all assembly headers.

**Data Sources**
- Assembly Header

## Assembly Line Measures
- [Qty. on Asm. Component](#qty-on-asm-component)  

### Qty. on Asm. Component
**Formula**  
- This measure shows how many items are yet to be assembled for a finished product by summing up the remaining quantity of items on all assembly lines.

**Data Sources**
- Assembly Line

## Bins Measures
- [ATO Components Pick Qty.](#ato-components-pick-qty)  
- [Available Qty. to Take](#available-qty-to-take)
- [Negative Adjmt. Qty. (Base)](#negative-adjmt-qty-base)  
- [Pick Quantity (Base)](#pick-quantity-base)
- [Positive Adjmt. Qty. (Base)](#positive-adjmt-qty-base)
- [Put-away Quantity (Base)](#put-away-quantity-base)
- [Quantity in Adjustment Bin](#quantity-in-adjustment-bin)    
- [Warehouse Quantity](#warehouse-quantity)  

### ATO Components Pick Qty.
**Formula**  
- This measure calculates the total quantity taken from the warehouse for "Assemble to Order" components by summing the qtyBase from Warehouse Activity Lines where actionType is Take, assembleToOrder is TRUE, and atoComponent is TRUE. This measure captures only the quantities picked specifically for assembling made-to-order products.

**Data Sources**
- Warehouse Activity Line

### Available Qty. to Take
**Formula**  
- This measure calculates the quantity of an item that is available to be picked. It subtracts the [Pick Quantity (Base)](#pick-quantity-base), [ATO Components Pick Qty.](#ato-components-pick-qty), and [Negative Adjmt. Qty. (Base)](#negative-adjmt-qty-base) measures from [Warehouse Quantity](#warehouse-quantity), but only for the bins that are not marked as adjustment bins.

**Data Sources**
- Warehouse Entry
- Bin

### Negative Adjmt. Qty. (Base)
**Formula**  
- This measure calculates the total quantity of an item that has been removed from the warehouse due to adjustments. This includes any adjustments that result in inventory decreases in the Warehouse Journal Line table.

**Data Sources**
- Warehouse Journal Line

### Pick Quantity (Base)
**Formula**  
- This measure calculates the total quantity of an item that has been picked from the warehouse for sales or transfer orders. It only includes the quantity that has been picked, not received or moved within the warehouse.

**Data Sources**
- Warehouse Activity Line

### Positive Adjmt. Qty. (Base)
**Formula**  
- This measure calculates the total quantity of an item that has been added to the warehouse due to adjustments. This includes any adjustments that result in inventory increases in the Warehouse Journal Line table.

**Data Sources**
- Warehouse Journal Line

### Put-away Quantity (Base)
**Formula**  
- This measure calculates the total quantity of an item that has been placed in the warehouse for storage. It only includes the quantity that has been put away, not picked or moved within the warehouse.

**Data Sources**
- Warehouse Activity Line

### Quantity in Adjustment Bin
**Formula**
- This measure calculates the total quantity located in bins that are marked as adjustment bins. It first identifies the bins flagged as adjustment bins by creating a filtered table (AdjustmentBins). Then, it sums the Qty. (Base) values from the Warehouse Entries table, applying this filter to include only adjustment bins. The measure ensures the quantity reflects only the specified adjustment bins by removing other bin filters.

**Data Sources**
- Warehouse Entry
- Location

### Warehouse Quantity
**Formula**  
- This measure calculates the total quantity of an item that is currently in the warehouse by summing the base quantity from the Warehouse Entry table.

**Data Sources**
- Warehouse Entry


## Items Availability Measures
- [Gross Requirement](#gross-requirement)
- [Planned Order Receipt](#planned-order-receipt)  
- [Planned Order Releases](#planned-order-releases)    
- [Projected Available Balance](#projected-available-balance)
- [Scheduled Receipt](#scheduled-receipt)

### Gross Requirement
**Formula**  
- This measure calculates the total quantity of an item that is needed to fulfill various orders and projects.

# Set Up Shipping Agents
You can set up a code for each of your shipping agents and enter information about them.  

If you enter an Internet address for the shipping agent, and the agent provides package tracking services on the Internet, you can use the automatic package tracking feature. For more information, see [Track Packages](sales-how-track-packages.md).

When you set up shipping agents on your sales orders, you can also specify the services that each shipping agent offers.  
For each shipping agent, you can set up an unlimited number of services, and you can specify a shipping time for each service.  

When you have assigned a shipping agent service to a sales order line, the shipping time of the service will be included in the order promising calculation, for that line. For more information, see [Calculate Order Promising Dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md).

## To set up a shipping agent  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shipping Agents**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].  
3.  Choose the **Shipping Agent Services** action.
4. In the **Shipping Agent Services**, fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]  
>  If you delete the shipping agent on the order line, the shipping agent service code is also deleted. The contents of fields that were based in part on the shipping agent service are recalculated.

# Fixed assets analytics

Businesses with fixed assets capture a lot of data about them during daily activities. That data supports valuable business intelligence (BI) for fixed assets managers:

- Asset acquisitions
- Asset deprecation
- Insurance and maintenance
- Asset budgets

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share data about your organization's fixed assets:

- Financial reporting (for financial statements and KPIs on fixed assets accounts)
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using open in Excel)
- Built-in fixed assets analytics tools
- Built-in fixed assets reports

> [!NOTE]
> Analytics for fixed assets is a little different than other areas. You need to analyze data that's already present, such as asset acquisitions, deprecation, and insurance, but also data about future (projected) data, such as depreciation and asset retirements. For the latter type of analysis, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has built-in reports that can calculate these numbers.

Each feature has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data analysis and the role of the user. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article describes ways use these analytical features to get insights into your fixed assets.

## Analytics needs in asset management

When thinking of analytics needs in asset management, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes their analytics needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

When it comes to data, people in different roles have different needs, and they use the data in different ways. For example, people in asset management and finance interact with data differently than people in sales.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role              | Data aggregation  | Typical ways to consume data                          | 
|-------------------|-------------------| ----------------------------------------------------- |
|CFO / COO / CEO                 | Performance data  | KPIs <br> Dashboards <br> Financial reports           |
|Asset Management / Controller   | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports <br> Ad-hoc analysis      | 
|Bookkeeper                      | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports <br> On-screen task data |

## Asset Management KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In asset management, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their organization's use of assets:

- Total Asset Turnover
- Return on Assets

## Use financial reporting to produce financial statements and KPIs related to fixed assets

The **Financial Reporting** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. Specifically for asset management, you can set up financial reports on the general ledger (G/L) accounts that you use to track fixed assets postings.

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence. A dimension is data that you can add to an entry as a parameter. Dimensions let you group entries that have similar characteristics, such as customers, products, and salesperson, and easily retrieve these groups for analysis. Among other purposes, you use dimensions when you define analysis views and create financial reports. Learn more at [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

To learn more about financial reporting, go to [Prepare Financial Reports with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md).

## Finance reporting across business units or legal entities (related to fixed assets)

Some organizations use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in multiple business units or legal entities. Others use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in subsidiaries report to parent organizations. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives accountants tools that help them transfer general ledger entries from two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company. Specifically for asset management, you might want to consolidate general ledger entries for your fixed assets accounts to be able to track fixed assets KPIs across business units or legal entities.

To learn more, go to [Company consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of fixed assets data

Sometimes, you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The data analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **General Ledger Entries** or **Fixed Asset Ledger Entries**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-fa-ledger-entries-asset-overview-current-value.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the FA Ledger Entries page to see asset value." lightbox="media/data-analysis-fa-ledger-entries-asset-overview-current-value.png":::

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page for ledger entries, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

<!-- :::image type="content" source="media/open-in-excel-gl-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the G/L entries data using Excel." lightbox="media/open-in-excel-gl-entries.png"::: -->

[!INCLUDE [onedrive-excel-online](includes/onedrive-excel-online.md)]

For more information on how to do ad-hoc analysis on Fixed Assets ledgers, see [Ad-hoc analysis of fixed assets data](ad-hoc-analysis-fa.md).


## Built-in reports for fixed assets

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports, tracing functions, and tools to help auditors or controllers who report on fixed assets.

[!INCLUDE [fa_reports_report_explorer](includes/fa-reports-report-explorer-include.md)]

For more information about reports that are relevant for fixed assets, see [Built-in fixed assets reports](fa-reports.md).

## On-screen fixed assets analytics

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you fixed assets overviews and tasks to do. Here are some examples to get you started:

- [Calculate depreciation, post depreciation, and analyze depreciation](fa-how-depreciate-amortize.md)
- [Monitor maintenance costs](fa-how-maintain.md#monitor-maintenance-costs)
- [Monitor insurance coverage](fa-how-insure.md#to-monitor-insurance-coverage)
- [View changed depreciation book values](fa-how-trans-split-combine.md#to-view-changed-depreciation-book-values-due-to-fixed-asset-reclassification)
- [View disposal ledger entries](fa-how-dispose-retire.md#to-view-disposal-ledger-entries)
- [View projected disposal values](fa-how-manage-budgets.md#to-view-projected-disposal-values)

### Show fixed asset general ledger entries and balances from the Chart of Accounts page

The Chart of Accounts page shows all general ledger accounts with aggregated numbers in the general ledger. From this page, you can do things like:  

- View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.  
- Review a list of posting groups for that account.
- View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

Specifically for fixed assets, you can create a view on the Chart of Accounts page that only shows asset accounts, or maybe only the asset accounts you use for posting fixed assets entries.

:::image type="content" source="media/chart-of-accounts-page-fa.png" alt-text="Example of how the Chart of Accounts page shows finance insights" lightbox="media/chart-of-accounts-page-fa.png":::

To learn more, go to [Understand the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md#the-chart-of-accounts).

### Analyze data by dimensions (related to fixed assets)

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as FA journals. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the department or location an entry came from.  

So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department or location, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts structure.

To learn more, go to [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md)

# Current Utilization (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Current Utilization** report provides insights into the manufacturing capacity use and helps with capacity planning. It shows the capacity available and used by hours and the percentage of use.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/current-utilization.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Current Utilization Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/current-utilization.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for business leaders and manufacturing teams.

COOs use the report to monitor the percentage of use of resources on production lines and ensure efficient allocation. You can analyze the capacity utilization gauges to track the current week's utilization percentage. The analysis can help you make necessary adjustments to meet production deadlines. The report also helps you track the expected capacity need percentage to keep the utilization rate above the required threshold.

Manufacturing managers use the report to understand the capacity of machine and work centers. The report provides insights into the capacity used by hour, allowing you to optimize the use of your machine and work centers. You can use the gauges to track today's utilization percentage and the current week's utilization percentage, and adjust the production schedules accordingly. The report helps you ensure that you complete production orders on time by keeping the utilization rate above the required threshold.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Current Utilization* report includes the following KPIs and measures:

# Set Up Business Central Access in Teams with Microsoft 365 Licenses

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Administrators must complete multiple activities before users can access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with their Microsoft 365 license. The steps below represent the minimum setup required to get started. To learn more about access with Microsoft 365 licenses, go to [Business Central Access with Microsoft 365 Licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md).

## Guidelines

Setting up access with Microsoft 365 licenses involves the following tasks:

|Step|Task|Required|
|-|-|-|
|1|[Configure which Business Central data the Microsoft 365 licensed users have permission to view](#configure-permissions)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
|2|[Enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses on the Business Central environment](#enable-access-with-microsoft-365-licenses)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
|3|[Assign security group to the environment](#choose-who-gets-access-by-using-security-group)|
|4|[Deploy the Business Central app for Teams to users](#deploy-the-business-central-app-for-teams)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
|5|[Test the setup](#test-your-setup)||

> [!TIP]
> Except for the last task, you can complete the tasks in any order. You can do tasks separately, as described in the sections that follow or use the **Access with Microsoft 365 licenses** assisted setup guide to walk you through them.
>
> To run the assisted setup, do the following steps:
>
> 1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link.
> 2. On the **Assisted Setup** page, go to the **Do more with Business Central** section and select **Access with Microsoft 365 licenses**.
> 3. Follow the instructions.  

## Configure permissions

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is secure by design and minimizes risk by granting no permissions to Microsoft 365 users out of the box. Administrators must configure object permissions that determine which tables, pages and reports can be accessed in Teams with only a Microsoft 365 license. These permissions are the starting permissions assigned when a user signs in for the first time with their Microsoft 365 license. 

To configure starting permissions:

1. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], search for **License Configuration**.
2. Select the Microsoft 365 license.
3. At the top of the **Microsoft 365** license page, select the edit icon ![Edit icon](media/edit-pencil.png), then turn on **Customize permissions**. 
4. In the **Custom Permission Sets** section, add the appropriate permission sets and choose whether they're applicable to a single company or all companies within the environment.

With this configuration, users with only a Microsoft 365 license are added to the **Users** list when they access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for the first time. For more information about users, go to [Creating Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When synchronizing the users list in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with users in Microsoft 365, only users that have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license are added to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s users list. For more administrative control over permissions and profiles, you can assign a security group to the environment. When environments are secured using a security group and enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses, the **Update users from Microsoft 365** action in the **Users** page will also include users that only have a Microsoft 365 license. To learn about securing environments, see [Manage access using Microsoft Entra groups](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access#manage-access-using-azure-active-directory-groups) in the developer and IT pro help.

> [!TIP]
> Looking for a quicker way to get started when trying out this feature on a sandbox or evaluation company? Assign the **D365 Read** permission set, which grants permission to most objects.  

When working with multiple environments, license configuration must be applied to each environment and can be different on each environment.

Learn more at [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md) and [Composing Permission Sets](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-permissionset-composing).

## Enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses

Access with Microsoft 365 licenses is off by default. Access must be enabled for each environment independently, giving administrators control and allowing for staged rollout across the organization. You turn on access by using the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] admin center: 

1. In the upper-right corner, select **Settings** ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") > **Admin Center**.  
2. In the admin center, select **Environments**, then select the environment on which you want to change license access. 
3. On the **Environment details** page, select **Modify** for the **Access with Microsoft 365 licenses** setting.
4. In the **Microsoft 365 licenses** pane, turn on the switch. 
5. Select **Save** when done and accept the confirmation. The change comes into effect immediately.

## Choose who gets access by using security group

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

In the Business Center admin center, an environment can be assigned to one or more security groups to control access. You can assign a Microsoft Entra group to the environment. By assigning a Microsoft Entra group to an environment, only direct and indirect members of the group are granted access to the environment. Indirect members are users in another group, which itself is a member of the group assigned to the environment. Although all licensed users in Microsoft Entra ID will be added to the environment when it's synchronized with Microsoft 365, only group members can sign in. Learn more in [Manage access using Microsoft Entra groups](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access#manage-access-using-azure-active-directory-groups) in the developer and IT pro help.

People in the security group must also have an applicable Microsoft 365 license to access Business Central from within Microsoft Teams. Get a list of applicable licenses in [Business Central access with Microsoft 365 licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md#requirements-for-individual-users-to-access-data-in-teams).

## Deploy the Business Central app for Teams

For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license holders to share data in Teams, and for Microsoft 365 license holders to access that data, each must have the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams installed. Although users can install the app by themselves, it's recommended that administrators use centralized deployment. Centralized deployment lets you roll out the app to a broader audience across the organization and minimize individual user effort. Laern more in [Installing the Business Central app by using Centralized Deployment](admin-teams-integration.md#installing-the-business-central-app-by-using-centralized-deployment).

> [!NOTE]
> If you have run centralized deployment before and only deployed the app to the security group of licensed [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users, you'll need to run it again to deploy to additional groups or the whole organization, depending on how you are configuring access.

> [!TIP]
> Looking for a quicker way to get started when trying out this feature? Test users can install the app at [aka.ms/BCgetTeamsApp](https://aka.ms/BCgetTeamsApp).

## Test your setup

To verify that your setup is ready for production, the following steps will help you build the confidence that everything works as it should.

1. Create or identify two test users (A and B).

   - Test user A must have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license and Microsoft 365 license with access to Teams.
   - Test user B must have only a Microsoft 365 license with access to Teams.

2. Sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] web client as test user A.

   1. Open a record that test user B should have access to, such as an **Item** card in the appropriate company and environment.
   2. Select **Share** ![!Share to other apps action on pages.](media/share-icon.png) > **Share to Teams** to bring up the Share to Teams window.
   3. In the **Share to** field, add test user B as the recipient.
   4. Wait for the link to expand to a card and select Share.

3. Sign into Microsoft Teams as test user B.

   1. Select Chat and open the conversation with test user A.
   2. In the message sent by test user A, select the Details button on the card. If the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client is displayed and is read-only, your setup was successful.

# About inventory costing
Managing inventory costs is concerned with recording and reporting business operating costs. It includes the reporting of manufacturing costs and inventory costs, that is, the value of items.  

 Central principles to understand are that costing methods define how items are valued when they leave inventory, that cost adjustment updates the cost of goods sold with related purchase costs posted after the sale, and that inventory values must be posted to dedicated G/L accounts at regular intervals.  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.   

|**To**|**See**|

# View the Status of Synchronization Jobs


Use the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page to view the status of synchronization jobs that have been run for coupled records in a Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integrations. This includes jobs that were run from the job queue and manual synchronization jobs that ran on records from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, viewing their status is helpful when troubleshooting because it gives you access to details about errors related to coupled records. Typically, these types of errors are caused by user actions, for example, when:  

* Two people made a change to the same data in both business apps.
* Someone deleted data in one of the apps, but not both.

> [!Note]
> The **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page shows information about jobs related to coupled records. If you resolve all of the errors but records are still not synchronizing, it might have something to do with a setting for the integration. Typically, your administrator will need to resolve those types of errors.   

## Example
This video shows an example of how to troubleshoot errors that happened while synchronizing with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. The process will be the same for all integrations. 

> [!VIDEO https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2097304]


## To view and resolve synchronization errors for coupled records
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors**, and then choose the related link.
2. The **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page shows issues that occurred when you synchronized coupled records. The following table includes actions that you can use to resolve issues one by one:

|Action|Description|
|----|----|
|**Remove Coupling**|Uncouples the records and they will no longer synchronize. To restart the synchronization you must couple them again. |
|**Retry** and **Retry All**|For each record where an error is found, synchronization is skipped unless you fix the issue. Retry will include the selected record in the next synchronization, and **Retry All** includes all of the records.|
|**Synchronize**|The app will try to resolve a conflict where data was changed in both business apps. You can choose the data to use.|
|**Restore Records** and **Delete Records**|These are useful when a record was deleted in one of the business apps. Delete Records deletes the record or row in the app where it still exists. Restore Records recreates the record or row in the business app where it was deleted.|

> [!NOTE]
> To reduce the number of conflicts you need to resolve, you can set up your integration table mappings to apply these actions automatically. For more information, [Mapping Integration Tables](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md#mapping-integration-tables).

## To view the synchronization log for a specific (manually synchronized) record
1. Open, for example, a customer, item or any other record that is synchronizing data between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].
2. Choose the **Synchronization Log** action to view the synchronization log for a selected record. For example, a specific customer you synchronized manually.

## Remove Couplings Between Records
When something goes wrong in your integration and you need to uncouple records to stop synchronizing them, you can do so for one or more records at a time. You can uncouple one or more records from list pages or the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page by choosing one or more lines and choosing **Delete Coupling**. You can also remove all couplings for one or more table mappings on the **Integration Table Mappings** page. 

If an entity with a unidirectional coupling is deleted in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must manually delete the broken coupling. To do that, on the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page, choose the **Find for Deleted** action, and then delete the couplings.

# Dimension Set Entries Overview
This topic describes how dimension set entries are stored and posted in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Dimension Sets  
A dimension set is a unique combination of dimension values. It is stored as dimension set entries in the database. Each dimension set entry represents a single dimension value. The dimension set is identified by a common dimension set ID that is assigned to each dimension set entry that belongs to the dimension set.  

The following example shows a dimension set that has three dimension set entries. The dimension set is identified by a dimension set ID, which is 108.  

|Dimension Set ID|Dimension Code|Dimension Value Code|Dimension Value Name|  
|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|  
|108|AREA|70|America North|  
|108|BUSINESSGROUP|HOME|Home|  
|108|DEPARTMENT|SALES|Sales|  

## Dimension Set Entries  
Dimension sets are stored in the **Dimension Set Entry** table as dimension set entries with the same dimension set ID.  

![Flow of dimension set entries.](media/dimensionentrynav7.png "Flow of dimension set entries")  

When you create a new journal line, document header, or document line, you can specify a combination of dimension values. Instead of explicitly storing each dimension value in the database, a dimension set ID is assigned to the journal line, document header, or document line to specify the dimension set.  

When you edit and close the **Edit Dimension Set Entries** page, a check is performed to see whether the combination of dimension values exists as a dimension set in the table. If the combination occurs in the table, then the corresponding dimension set ID is assigned to the journal line, document header, or document line. Otherwise, a new dimension set is added to the table, and the new dimension set ID is assigned to the journal line, document header, or document line.

## Codeunit 408 Dimension Management
Codeunit 408, Dimension Management, is a function library that handles common tasks that are related to dimensions, such as copying from one table to another or from one document to another.

## Performance Improvement  
By storing dimension sets once in the database, database space is preserved and overall performance is improved.

# Enabling new and upcoming features ahead of time

Some new features can be enabled ahead of time, letting you take advantage of them as early as possible. Enabling features early gives you the time to test and prepare your organization for change.

When Microsoft releases features or feature design improvements as part of minor updates, some of the features aren't immediately enabled. Administrators can enable each feature from the **Feature Management** page. After a feature is enabled, it becomes available for all users on that environment no matter how they access [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Features can be safely turned off again. These features are only optional for a while.

# Analyze data by dimensions

In financial analysis, a dimension is data you add to an entry as a kind of marker to group entries with similar characteristics. For example, dimensions often group entries for customers, regions, products, and salespeople. The groups let you easily retrieve data about them for analysis. You can use dimensions on entries in journals, documents, and budgets.

Each dimension describes the focus of analysis. So, a two-dimensional analysis, for example, would be sales per area. By using more than two dimensions when you create an entry, you can carry out a more complex analysis. An example of a complex analysis is exploring sales per sales campaign per customer group per area. That gives you greater insight into your business, such as how well your business is operating, where it is or isn't thriving, and where you should allocate more resources. That insight helps you make more informed business decisions. Learn more at [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

> [!TIP]
> As a quick way to analyze transactional data by dimensions, you can filter totals in the chart of accounts (COA) and entries in all **Entries** pages by dimensions. Look for the **Set Dimension Filter** action.

> [!NOTE]
> If you discover that an incorrect dimension value was used on posted general ledger entries, you can correct it and update your analysis views. To learn more, go to [Troubleshooting and Correcting Dimensions](finance-troubleshooting-correcting-dimensions.md#changing-dimension-assignments-after-posting).

## Set up an analysis view

An analysis by dimensions uses a selected combination of dimensions. You store, retrieve, and update that dimension set by creating an **Analysis View** card.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Analysis Views**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Analysis View List** page, choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. To add other dimension codes in addition to the four on the **Dimensions** FastTab, choose the **Filter** action, fill in the fields, then choose the **OK** button.  
5. To update the view, choose the **Update** action.

## Analyze by dimensions

Use analysis views you've already set up with the **Analysis by Dimensions** matrix to view the amounts in your general ledger.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Analysis Views**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant analysis view, then choose the **Analysis by Dimensions** action.
3. On the **Analysis by Dimensions** page, fill in the fields to define what data to show, and how.
4. Choose the **Show Matrix** action to open the matrix page for the analysis view.
5. To access details of an amount in the matrix page, choose the amount.  

- The columns on the left contain information based on what you've selected in the **Show as Lines** field in the header.  
- The columns on the right contain information based on what you've selected in the **Show as Columns** field in the header.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can't select a period length that's shorter than the period specified for the date compression on the **Analysis View** card. The **Next Set** and **Previous Set** actions aren't available if you've selected **Period** in either the **Show as Lines** or **Show as Columns** fields.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can use the **Dimensions - Detail** report to display a detailed classification of how dimensions have been used on entries over a selected period. You can use the **Dimensions - Total** report to display only the total amounts.  

> [!TIP]  
> You can also change the view by changing the contents of the **Show as Lines** and **Show as Columns** fields. To reverse a view setting, choose the **Reverse Lines and Columns** action.

## Update an analysis view

The amounts on the **Analysis by Dimensions** page give you a picture of the company's state at the time of the last update. To get the current state, run the update action to update the analysis view.

Use the following procedure to update an analysis view from the **Analysis by Dimensions** page. The steps are similar to those for updating the **Analysis View Card** and **Analysis View List** pages.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Analysis Views**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant analysis view, then choose the **Analysis by Dimensions** action.
3. On the **Analysis by Dimensions** page, choose the **Analysis View Code** field.  
4. Select the line with the relevant analysis view.  
5. On the **Analysis Views** page, select the analysis view, then choose the **Update** action.  

> [!TIP]  
> If you select the **Update on Posting** checkbox on an analysis view card, the view automatically updates when someone posts an associated transaction.

> [!NOTE]  
> To update some or all analysis views at the same time, use the **Update Analysis Views** batch job.

# Introduction to Microsoft Fabric and Business Central

[!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] is an end-to-end analytics solution with full-service capabilities including data movement, data lakes, data engineering, data integration, data science, real-time analytics, and business intelligence&mdash;all backed by a shared platform providing robust data security, governance, and compliance. Your organization no longer needs to stitch together individual analytics services from multiple vendors. Instead, use a streamlined solution that’s easy to connect, onboard, and operate.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about the Microsoft Fabric release plan, see [aka.ms/FabricRoadmap](https://aka.ms/FabricRoadmap)
> 
> The regular publishing of this roadmap will help you stay informed about how [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] will address your needs.

## Where does [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] fit into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] analytics

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] comes with many out-of-the-box reports and data analysis capabilities such as financial reporting, open in Excel, and analysis mode on lists and queries. On top of this, it's easy to define Power BI reports that read data from standard and custom APIs, define Power BI metrics scorecards, and embed all of these directly in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client. But for customers with more advanced data science or business intelligence scenarios that require richer data engineering or data integration, [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] might be a good option. 

## OneLake

A key part of [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] offering is OneLake. OneLake is a single, unified, logical data lake for the whole organization. You can think of OneLake as the OneDrive for data. It provides you with data lake as a service without having to build it yourself. OneLake comes automatically with every [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] tenant with no infrastructure to manage. All the data, which lands in OneLake, automatically takes part in out-of-the-box data governance such as data lineage, data protection, certification, and catalog integration. It breaks down data silos by enabling different parts of the organization to work independently while still contributing to the same data lake.

[!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] items store your data in OneLake in an open file format. For structured tabular data, this format is *delta parquet*. Delta parquet format allows every analytics engine in [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] to access the data from other analytics engines. This way, it allows flexibility for data practitioners to use the tools of your choice.

# Reconcile vendor payments with the payment journal or from vendor ledger entries
When you send a payment or receive a refund from a vendor, you must decide whether to apply the payment or refund to one or more open entries. You can specify the exact amount that you want to apply to the payment receipt or refund, and then only partially apply vendor ledger entries. You must apply all vendor ledger entries to obtain correct vendor statistics and reports of the account statements and finance charges.

> [!NOTE]  
>   Vendors may sometimes give a payment refund instead of a credit memo to offset against future invoices, especially when you return items that you have already paid for or when you have overpaid an invoice.

You can apply vendor ledger entries in three different ways:

* By entering information in dedicated pages, such as the **Payment Journals** page and the **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page.
* From purchase credit memo documents.
* From vendor ledger entries after purchase documents are posted but not applied.

> [!NOTE]  
>   If the **Application Method** field on the vendor card contains **Apply to Oldest**, then payments will automatically be applied to the oldest open credit entry if you do not manually specify which entry to apply to. If the application method for a customer is **Manual**, then you must apply entries manually.

You can apply vendor payments manually to their related purchase documents when you post the payments on the **Payment Journals** page. For information about filling the payment journal, see [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).

You can also apply vendor payments, and customer payments, after the payments appear as negative bank transactions in your bank. On the **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page, you can use functions for bank statement import, automatic application, and bank account reconciliation. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).

6. Choose the **OK** button.  
   The **Purchase Credit Memos** page shows the entry that you have selected in the **Applies-to Doc. Type** field and the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field. The page also shows the amount of the credit memo to be posted, adjusted for any payment discounts.
7. Choose the **Post** button to post the purchase credit memo.

## To apply posted vendor ledger entries
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant vendor with entries that have already been posted.

9. Choose the **OK** button to post the application.

## To apply vendor ledger entries in different currencies to one another
If you buy from a vendor in one currency and make payment in another currency, you can still apply the invoice to the payment.

If you apply an entry (Entry 1) in one currency to an entry (Entry 2) in a different currency, the posting date on Entry 1 is used to find the relevant exchange rate to convert amounts on Entry 2. The relevant exchange rate is found on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page. In that case, you must enable application of vendor ledger entries in different currencies. For more information, see [Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies](finance-how-enable-application-ledger-entries-different-currencies.md)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the journal you want, and fill in the first empty journal line using a currency code.
3. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.

5. Choose the **OK** button to return to the payment journal.
6. Post the payment journal.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   When you apply entries in different currencies to one another, the entries are converted to USD. Even though the exchange rates for the two relevant currencies are fixed, for example between USD and EUR, there may be a small residual amount when these foreign-currency amounts are converted to USD. These small residual amounts are posted as gains and losses to the account specified in the **Realized Gains Account** or **Realized Losses Account** field on the **Currencies** page. The **Amount (USD)** field is also adjusted on the relevant vendor ledger entries.

## To unapply an application of vendor entries
When you unapply an erroneous application, correcting entries that are identical to the original entry but with opposite sign in the amount field is created and posted for all entries, including all general ledger posting derived from the application, such as payment discount and currency gains/losses. The entries that were closed by the application are reopened.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant vendor card.
3. Choose the **Ledger Entries** action.
4. Select the relevant ledger entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
5. Alternatively, choose the **Detailed Ledger Entry** action.
6. Select the application entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
7. Fill in the fields in the header, and then choose the **Unapply** action.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   If an entry has been applied by more than one application entry, you must unapply the latest application entry first.

title: Service Price Management
description: Service price management lets you set up service price groups, service pricing, service pricing adjustment and more.

# Service Price Management
The service price management functionality lets you apply the best price to service orders, set up personalized service price agreements for customers, improve service employees' efficiency, and accelerate the invoicing process.  
  
Service price management lets you set up different service price groups so you can consider the service item or service item group, in addition to the type of fault that the service task involves. You can set up these groups for a limited period of time, or for a specific customer or currency. You can use price calculation structures as templates to assign a specific price to a specific service task.  
  
For example, this makes it possible to assign specific items included in the service price, in addition to the type of work included. This also makes it possible to use different VAT and discount amounts for different service price groups. To make sure that the correct prices are applied, you can assign fixed, minimum, or maximum prices, depending on the agreements that you have with your customers.  
  
Before adjusting the price of a service item on a service order, you are provided with an overview of what the results of the price adjustment will be. You can approve of these results, or you can make additional changes, if you want to have a different result. The whole adjustment is performed line by line, which means that there are no additional lines created.  
  
Finally, service price group statistics and standard reports let you keep track of the profitability of each service price group.  
  
## Service Price Adjustment Groups  
You use service price adjustment groups to set up the different types of price adjustments for service lines. For example, you can set up a service price adjustment group that adjusts prices for spare parts, one that adjusts prices for labor, one that adjusts prices for costs, and so on. You can also specify whether the service price adjustment should be applied to just one specific item or resource, or to all items or resources.  
  
The service price adjustment function does not apply to service items under the following conditions:

* The item belongs to service contracts. You can only adjust the service prices of items that are part of a service order. 
* If the service item has a warranty. 
* If the service line has been posted as invoice, either fully or partially.  
  
When you run the service price adjustment function, all of the discounts in the order will be replaced by the values of the service price adjustment.  
  
## Service Price Groups  
You can set up service price groups to create groups of service items that receive the same special service pricing. When you have set up service price groups, you can then assign them to service items on service item lines. You can also assign service price groups to service item groups.  
  
Before you can assign a service price group to a service item, you have to determine to which fault area, currency, or service price adjustment group the service price group applies. You have to determine to which amount the service price should be adjusted, and whether this amount should include VAT and discounts. You also have to determine whether this adjustment concerns a fixed amount, or should only be applied under certain conditions.  
  
When you assign a service price group to a service item, all the special service pricing that you set up in this group will then apply for this service item.  
  
## Service Pricing  
You set up the actual types of service pricing (price adjustment type and price) for a combination of service price groups and customer price groups. For each type of service pricing, you select a service price adjustment group. You also specify the service price adjustment type, fixed, maximum, or minimum, and the actual price.  
  
For example, you can set up types of service pricing for a radio service price group. For customers without a price group, you can decide to have service pricing with maximum price on labor, which is the labor price adjustment group. For customers with a particular price group, you can decide to have service pricing with a fixed price on labor, the same labor price adjustment group.  

#### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the service item, expand the **Prices and Sales** FastTab, choose the **Resource**, **Item**, or **G/L Account** action.
3. On the **Project Resource Prices**, **Project Item Prices**, or **Project G/L Account Prices** pages, fill in the fields as necessary.

  
## Service Price Adjustment  
Service price adjustment lets you adjust the price of an item, resource, general ledger account, or cost on a service order.  
  
After you have entered an item on the service item line, you then enter all information about the costs of this item on the service lines. When you run the Adjust Service Price function, you can preview the price adjustments. You can make modifications if you have to. When you acknowledge the modifications, the adjustments are calculated, and are then transferred to the service lines. You then post the service order.  
  
Depending on the type of service price adjustment, the total amount of the adjustments is calculated.  
  
The following table describes the calculations.  
  
|Option | Description |  
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Fixed Price**|This means that you charge a fixed price for the service item, resource, general ledger account, or cost, regardless of the real costs or regular charges. Selecting this option means that the service price adjustment will reach the exact amount specified in the service price group.|  
|**Maximum**|This means that you put an upper limit on the charge to your customer, regardless of the real costs or regular charges. Selecting this option means that the service price adjustment will only be performed if the total price exceeds the amount specified in the service price group.|  
|**Minimum**|This means that you put a lower limit on the charge to your customer, regardless of the real costs or regular charges. Selecting this option means that the service price adjustment will only be performed if the total amount is less than the amount specified on the service price group.|

# About item types

In the **Type** field on the **Item Card** page, you can select what the item is used for in your business, which affects the degree to which you can manage the item in inventory. The following table lists and describes the three types of items that are available.

|Option|Typical Purpose|
|------|-----------|
|Inventory|Physical things, such as bicycles, telephones, and desks, for which you want to be able to use all inventory processes. Inventory items can also include nonphysical items, such as software licenses and subscriptions, if the items have identification numbers, such as serial numbers. You can fully track item values and availability in inventory.|
|Non-Inventory|Typically, noninventory items are physical things, such as bolts or pens, that your business consumes but doesn't fully track in inventory. For example, because they're low-cost items and only used internally.|
|Service|A labor time unit, such as a consultancy hour, for limited business support.|

> [!NOTE]
> The **Service** and **Non-Inventory** types don't let you track inventory quantities and values. Only selected item transaction types and features are supported. The following table lists the features that the three item types support.

|Item Type|Sales|Purchasing|Job Consumption|Service Consumption|Assembly Consumption|Production Consumption|Assembly Output|Production Output|Location Transfer|Physical Counting|Inventory Revaluation|Inventory Costing|Item Tracking|Reservation|Warehousing|Planning|Order Planning|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Inventory|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Non-Inventory|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|
|Service|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|

## Costing methods for types of items

When you post inventory transactions, the quantity and value changes to the inventory are recorded in the item ledger entries and the value entries, respectively.

You record the cost of inventory items in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field on the **Value Entries** page. When you reconcile the entry to the general ledger, the cost shows in the **Cost Posted to G/L** field. To learn more about inventory costing, go to [Design Details: Inventory Costing](design-details-inventory-costing.md).

For noninventory and service items, cost is recorded in the **Cost Amount (Non-Invtbl.)** field on the **Value Entries** page. For noninventory and service items, specify cost on sales, assembly, and production documents and journals. Specify the default cost in the **Unit Cost** field on the **Item Card** and **Stockkeeping Unit** pages. Costs for these types of items aren't reconciled to the general ledger.

## Catalog and service items

You can set up items that you offer to your customers but you don't manage in until you sell them as catalog items. Although catalog items are similar to regular items of the type **Non-Inventory** in this respect, don't confuse the two because there are differences. To learn more, go to [Work with Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).

Customer items that you service, such as a printer, are called service items. Service items have nothing to do with regular or catalog items. However, service components can be regular items. To learn more, go to [Set Up Service Items and Service Item Components](service-how-setup-service-items.md).

## Resources

In addition to the item type *Item*, sales and purchase documents also allow you to use the item type *Resource*. Like items, resources support dimensions, price lists, and units of measure. <!--With introduction of types *Service* and *Non-Inventory* we do not have any intention to add any extra capabilities for type Resource in purchase and sales processes. We recommend using items of applicable type instead. Resources will continue get new functionality to track the time and effort that is involved with performing and providing services and will stay important part of project and service management. Because many partner solutions use resources, we do not plan to deprecate them in the sales or purchase documents.-->

# Connect E-Documents to external access points

[!INCLUDE [e-documents connectors](includes/edocuments-connectors-include.md)]

You can use E-Documents in Business Central to send and receive electronic documents with your business partners. To receive documents, you need to connect E-Documents to an external access point that handles the communication and validation of the documents. 

 > [!NOTE]
 > These connections require communication with external service providers who might be subject to additional payment and require contracts with them. To obtain all the necessary credentials, contact the service providers.

The steps to connect E-Documents to an external access point depend on the type of connector you choose.    

> [!NOTE]
> Ask your service provider for all the necessary details to establish a connection with their access point that follows.  

## Pagero service

1. On the **E-Document External Connection Setup** page, select the **Open OAuth 2.0 setup** action to open the **OAuth 2.0 Setup** page.  
2. On the **OAuth 2.0 setup** page, select the **Request Authorization Code** action. You're redirected to the external service authorization webpage and prompted for your sign-in details.
3. Copy the authorization code into the **Enter Authorization Code** field.  
4. Select **Refresh Access Token** to make sure that you can refresh the token. 
5. On the **E-Document External Connection Setup** page, fill in the following fields:

    | Field name | Description |

    | FileAPI URL | Specify the file API URL. |
    | Fileparts URL | Specify the fileparts URL. |
    | DocumentAPI URL | Specify the document API URL. |
    | Company ID | Specify the company ID. |
    | Send Mode | Specify the send mode. You can select **Production**, **Test**, or **Certification**. |

6. Continue with the [nonservice provider setup steps](finance-how-setup-edocuments-external.md).  

## Avalara service

> [!NOTE]
> The Avalara connector in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available from version 25.1

1. On the **Avalara Connection Setup** page, enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** fields. In the **Send Mode** field, choose the **Production**, **Test**, or **Certification** option, based on your plans. 
2. Select the **Select Avalara Company Id** action, and choose the right company. Make sure you enter values into the **Company Name** and **Company ID** fields.  
3. Select the **Select Avalara Mandate** action, and select the right **E-Document Service**, and then pick appropriate **Country Mandate** code on the **Avalara Mandate List** page. 
4. Navigate back to the **E-Document Service** page, and validate that the **Avalara Mandate** field in the **Avalara** FastTab is set with the value you chose. 
5. Continue with the [non-service provider setup steps](finance-how-setup-edocuments-external.md).

## Available service providers

At this moment, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports Pagero and Avalara access points for e-documents, but more access points are in the process of development. This page is updated with the parameters for new connectors when they're ready. You can also find more connectors on AppSource.

> [!NOTE]
> This page doesn't show how to connect with the local service providers. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] support some of them, it will be explained in the country-specific documentation.  

Microsoft doesn't have a contractual obligation with Pagero and Avalara. That means, if you want to use their connectors, you must have a contract with them.

# Analyze Actual Amounts Versus Budgeted Amounts

As a part of gathering, analyzing, and sharing your company data, you view actual amounts compared to budgeted amounts for all accounts and for several periods.

To analyze budgeted amounts, you must first create general ledger (G/L) budgets. Learn more at [Create G/L Budgets](finance-how-create-budgets.md).

## View a G/L budget

In a budget with dimensions, you can filter the entries and see specific budgets.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **G/L Budgets**, then choose the related link.
2. On the **G/L Budgets** page, open the budget you want to view.  
3. At the top of the page, fill in the fields necessary to define what is shown. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]  
> If you've selected **Period** in either the **Show as Lines** or **Show as Columns** field, then you must fill in the **View by** field. If you have not selected **Period** in either of those fields, enter the appropriate period in the **Date Filter** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Only entries from the general ledger budget with the filter codes you enter on the **Filters** FastTab are included in the calculation. Budget entries without any or with other filter codes are not included. As long as the filter remains on the page, the budget only displays entries with those filter codes.  

> [!TIP]  
> Use the **Edit Budget** action to modify the budget. On the budget page, choose an amount to view the underlying general ledger budget entries.

## View actual and budgeted amounts for all accounts

You can view general ledger budgets and compare them with actual figures in several areas of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, choose the **G/L Balance/Budget** action.
3. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary to define what is displayed in the table.  
4. Hover over a field on the table to read a short description about the displayed amount.

> [!NOTE]  
> The filters you set on the page header will be applied to both general ledger and budget entries.

The leftmost columns contain the chart of accounts. Of the five columns on the rightmost side, the first four columns show actual and budgeted debit and credit amounts for each account. The fifth column shows the proportional relationship between the actual and the budgeted amounts on the general ledger account.  

> [!TIP]  
> Use the **View by** field on the **G/L Balance/Budget** page to select the period length. Use the **View as** field to select the way the amounts will be calculated, either **Net Change** or **Balance at Date**. Choose the **Previous Period** or **Next Period** action to change the period.  

## To view actual and budgeted amounts for several periods  

Instead of viewing the actual and budgeted amounts for all accounts within a single period, you can view a number of periods for a single account.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, select the relevant general ledger account, then choose the **G/L Account Balance/Budget** action.  
3. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary to define what is displayed in the table.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, hover over a field on the table to read a short description about the displayed amount.

# Outbound Warehouse Processes

Outbound processes in warehouses start when you release a source document to take items out of a warehouse location. For example, either to ship the items somewhere or to move them to another company location. You can ship physical and non-inventory items. To learn more about receiving non-inventory items, go to [Post non-inventory items](#post-non-inventory-items). 

In principle, the process of shipping outbound orders consists of two activities:

* Picking items from the shelves.
* Shipping items out of the warehouse.

The source documents for outbound warehouse flow are:  

* Sales order  
* Outbound transfer order  
* Purchase return order  
* Service order  

> [!NOTE]
> Production and assembly orders with component needs also represent outbound source documents. Production and assembly orders are a little different because they're typically internal processes that don't involve shipping. Instead, they're used to put-away produced items or move the components needed to assemble an item to an assembly area. Learn more about these processes at [Design Details: Internal Warehouse Flows](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).  

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you pick and ship items using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Outbound Process|Require Pick|Require Shipment|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------|----------------|-----|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post the pick and shipment from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post the pick and shipment from an inventory pick document|Turned on||Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post the pick and shipment from a warehouse shipment document||Turned on|Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post the pick from a warehouse pick document, and post the shipment from a warehouse shipment document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

The approach to choose depends on your warehouse practices and level of organizational complexity. The following are some examples that might help you decide.

* In an order-by-order environment with straightforward processes and a simple bin structure, method A, picking and shipping from the order line is appropriate.
* If items for an order line come from more than one bin, or if warehouse workers can't work with order documents, the use of separate pick documents is appropriate, method B.
* If your picking and shipping processes involve multiple orders and require greater control and overview, you might choose to use a warehouse shipment document and warehouse pick document to separate the picking and shipping tasks, methods C and D.  

In methods A, B, and C, picking and shipping activities are combined in one step when posting the document as shipped. In method D, you first register the pick, and then post the shipment later from a different document.

> [!NOTE]
> While warehouse picks and inventory picks sound similar, they're different documents and are used in different processes.
> * The inventory pick used in method B, together with registering picking information, also posts the shipment of the source document.
> * The warehouse pick used in method D can't be posted and only registers the pick. The registration makes the items available for the warehouse shipment but doesn't post the shipment. In the outbound flow, the warehouse pick requires a warehouse shipment.

## No dedicated warehouse activity

The following articles provide information about how to process receipts for source documents if you don't have dedicated warehouse activities.

* [Sell Product](sales-how-sell-products.md)
* [Transfer Orders](inventory-how-transfer-between-locations.md)
* [Process Purchase Returns or Cancellations](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md)
* [Create Service Orders](service-how-to-create-service-orders.md)

## Basic warehouse configurations

The following diagram illustrates the outbound warehouse processes for different types of documents in basic warehouse configurations. The numbers in the diagram correspond with the steps in the sections following the diagram.  

:::image type="content" source="media/design-details-warehouse-management-outbound-basic-flow.png" alt-text="Shows the steps in a basic outbound flow in a warehouse.":::

### 1: Release a source document

When you use the **Release** action on a source document, such as a sales or transfer order, the items on the document are ready to be handled in the warehouse. For example, picked and put in the bin specified on the document. Alternatively, you can create inventory pick documents for individual lines on orders, in a push fashion, based on specified bins and quantities to handle.  

### 2: Create an inventory pick

On the **Inventory Pick** page, the warehouse worker retrieves, in a pull fashion, the source document lines. Alternatively, the inventory pick lines are already created, in a push fashion, by the user who is responsible for the source document.  

### 3: Post an inventory pick

On each line for items that have been picked or moved, partially or fully, fill in the **Quantity** field, and then post the inventory pick. Source documents related to the inventory pick are posted as shipped or consumed.  

For inventory picks, negative item ledger entries are created, warehouse entries are created, and the pick request is deleted, if fully handled. For example, the **Quantity Shipped** field on the outbound source document line is updated. A posted shipment document is created  that reflects the sales order, for example, and the shipped items.  

## Advanced warehouse configurations

The following diagram illustrates the outbound warehouse processes for different types of documents in advanced warehouse configurations. The numbers in the diagram correspond with the steps in the sections following the diagram.  

:::image type="content" source="media/design_details_warehouse_management_outbound_advanced_flow.png" alt-text="Shows the steps in an advanced outbound warehouse flow.":::

### 1: Release a source document

Releasing a source document in advanced configurations does the same thing as for basic configurations. The items become available for handling in the warehouse. For example, they can be included in a shipment.  

### 2: Create a warehouse shipment

On the **Warehouse Shipment** page, get the lines from the released source document. You can combine lines from several source document in one warehouse shipment.  

### 3: Create a warehouse pick

On the **Warehouse Shipment** page, create warehouse pick activities for warehouse shipments in one of two ways:

- In a push fashion, where you use the **Create Pick** action. Select the lines to be picked and prepare the picks by specifying, for example, which bins to take from and place in, and how many units to handle. The bins can be predefined for the warehouse location or resource.
- In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action. On the **Pick Worksheet** page, warehouse workers can use the **Get Warehouse Documents** action to get their assigned picks. When the warehouse picks are fully registered, the lines in the **Pick Worksheet** are deleted.

### 4: Register a warehouse pick

On the **Warehouse Pick** page, a warehouse worker fills in the **Quantity** field for each line that they've fully or partially picked, and then registers the pick.

Warehouse entries are created, and the warehouse pick lines are deleted if the full quantity was picked. The warehouse pick document remains open until the full quantity of the warehouse shipment is registered. The **Qty. Picked** field on the warehouse shipment lines is updated accordingly.  

### 5: Post the warehouse shipment

When all items on the warehouse shipment document are registered as picked, the warehouse worker posts the shipment. Posting updates the item ledger entries to reflect the reduction in inventory. For example, the **Quantity Shipped** field on the outbound source document line is updated.

# Walkthrough: Make cash flow forecasts using financial reports

This walkthrough describes how you can use the financial reports feature to make cash flow forecasts. Financial reports perform calculations that cannot be done directly in the chart of cash flow accounts. In the financial reports, you can set up subtotals for cash flow receipts and disbursements. These subtotals can be included in new totals that can then be used to make cash flow forecasts.  

## About this walkthrough

This walkthrough describes the following tasks:  

- Setting up a new cash flow financial report name.  
- Setting up financial report lines.  
- Setting up a new column definition.  
- Assigning a column definition to a financial report.  
- Viewing and printing the cash flow forecast.  

### Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you will need:  

- [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  
- A cash flow worksheet with registered lines  

## Roles

This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user role:  

- Controller  

## Story

Ken is a controller at CRONUS who makes monthly cash flow forecasts. Ken includes finance, sales, purchase, and fixed assets in the forecasts, and presents to CFO Sara for business insight.  

## Set up a new financial report name

The financial report name is the name you give the cash flow forecast that includes a series of defined lines and a column definition.  

### Set up a new financial report name  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Financial Reports** page, choose **New** to create a new cash flow financial report name.  
3. In the **Name** field, enter **Forecast**.  
4. In the **Description** field, enter **Cash Flow Forecast**.  
5. Leave the **Row Definition** and **Column Definition** fields blank.

## Set up row definition lines

After a financial report name is set up, Ken defines each line in the cash flow financial report. Ken defines lines to be shown in reports in addition to lines that are only for calculation purposes.  

### Set up row definition lines  

1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select the new **Forecast** financial report you created, then choose the **Edit Row Definition** action.  
2. On the **Row Definition** page, enter each line as shown in the following table.

## Set up a new column definition

Before printing the cash flow forecast, Ken needs to create the column definition for the numerical information. In the columns, Ken defines the information needed to use from the lines.

- The first column has the number *C10* with the title **Amount** and contains the net change.  
- The second column has the number *C20* with the title **Balance at Date** and contains the transactions for the period.  
- The third column has the number *C30* with the title **Entire Year** and contains the net change in the balances for the entire fiscal year.  
- Finally, Ken assigns the column definition as the default option for the **Forecast** financial report.  

### Set up a new column definition

1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select the new **Forecast** financial report name you created. On the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Edit Column Definition**.

2. Create a new column definition with the name **Cash Flow**.

3. Choose the **OK** button.

4. Enter each line exactly as shown in the following table.

    |Column No.|Column Header|Column Type|Ledger Entry Type|Amount Type|Show|  
    |----------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|----|
    |C10|Amount|Net Change|Entries|Net Amount|Always|  
    |C20|Amount Until Date|Balance at Date|Entries|Net Amount|Always|  
    |C30|Entire Fiscal Year|Entire Fiscal Year|Entries|Net Amount|Always|

## Assig the column definition to the financial report name

Ken is now ready to assign the column definition to the financial report name.  

### Assign the column definition to the financial report name

1. In the **Financial Reports** page, select the **Forecast** financial report, then choose the **Edit Column Definition** action.  
2. In the **Name** field, choose the column definition **Cash Flow** to assign as the default column definition.  

## View and print the cash flow forecast

1. On the **Financial Reports** page, choose the **Forecast** financial report [Financial analytics overview](bi.md)  to view the cash flow forecast.  
2. On the **Financial Report** page, you can select an amount and then view the cash flow forecast entries that make up the amount. In addition, you can view the formula used to calculate that amount. You can also filter the amounts by date and dimension.  
3. Choose the **Print** action to print the cash flow forecast.

# Merge duplicate records

As different users create new customer, vendor, or contact cards over time, or the new records are created automatically during migration, a customer, vendor, or contact may be represented in the system with more than one record. In this case, you can use the **Merge Duplicate** page from the card of the record that you want to keep. The page gives you an overview of duplicated field values and provides functions to select which values to keep or discard when merging two records into one.

> [!NOTE]
> Only users with the MERGE DUPLICATES permission set can use this functionality.

> [!TIP]
> The **Merge Duplicate** page shows all fields where the values are different for the two records being compared. Therefore, a duplicate is indicated by the page showing very few fields. Whereas, if the page shows many fields, then the suspected record is probably not a duplicate.

The following procedure is based on a customer card. The steps are similar for a vendor  and contact cards.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the customer that you know or suspect that a duplicate record exists for, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **Customer Card** page, choose the **Merge With** action.
4. On the **Merge Duplicate** page, in the **Merge With** field, select the customer that you believe is a duplicate of the one you have opened, indicated in the **Current** field.

    The **Fields** FastTab lists fields where the values are different for the two customers. This means that if the selected customer is really a duplicate, then only few fields should be listed, such as typing errors and other data entry mistakes.

    The **Related Tables** FastTab lists tables where there are fields with a relation to both customers. The **Current Count** and **Duplicate Count** fields show the number of fields in related tables where the **No.** value of both the current and the duplicate customer is used. On the **Merge Duplicate** page, this section is informational only, however, if merge conflicts exist, you'll resolve them on the **Merge Duplicate Conflicts** page. Refer to steps 8 through 12.

5. For each field where you want to use another value than the current one, select the **Override** checkbox. The value in the **Alternate Value** field will then be transferred to the current record when you complete the process.
6. When you have finished selecting which values to keep or override, choose the **Merge** action.

    The system checks if the merge of values for the duplicate customer into the current customer causes any conflicts. A conflict exists if a value in at least one primary-key field is the same for both customers while the value in the **No** field is different for the two customers.

7. If no conflicts are found, choose the **Yes** button in the confirmation message box.

    The duplicate customer is renamed so that all usage of its **No.** value in all fields with relations to the customer table will be replaced with the **No.** value of the current customer.
8. If conflicts exist, choose the **Resolve (xx) conflicts before merge.** action on the **Conflicts** FastTab, which will appear if conflicts exist.
9. On the **Merge Duplicate Conflicts** page, select the line for a related table with a conflict, and then choose the **View Details** action.

    The **Merge Duplicate** page now shows the fields in the selected table that cause a merge conflict between the two customer records. Notice in both the summarized values in the **Current** and **Conflicts With** fields and on the lines that at least one primary-key field is the same for both customers and the value of the **No.** field is different for the two customers.   
10. If you don't want to keep the duplicate customer record, choose the **Remove Duplicate** action, and then choose the **Close** button.

    Identical field values, other than the value in the **No.** field, are removed from the duplicate record and inserted on the current record.
11. If you want to keep the duplicate customer record after the merge,  choose the **Rename Duplicate**.
12. On lines, not for the **No.** field, where the field has the same value on both records, change the value in the **Alternate Value** field, and then choose the **Close** button.

    The conflicting field value is updated on the duplicate record so that it can be merged with the current record. The duplicate record continues to exist after the merge.
13. Repeat steps 8 through 12 until all conflicts are resolved. The **Conflicts** FastTab disappears.
14. On the **Merge Duplicate** page, choose the **Merge** action again, and then select the **Yes** button in the confirmation message box.

> [!NOTE]
> For contacts, you can use functionality to find duplicate contacts before you use the **Merge Duplicate** page. For more information, see [Search for duplicate contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md#search-for-duplicate-contacts).

# Set Up Fixed Asset Insurance

To manage fixed asset insurance coverage, you must first set up some general insurance information and an insurance card per policy.

## To set up general insurance information

To use the insurance features in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must set up some general insurance information.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Setups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To set up insurance types

You can group your insurance policies into categories, such as insurance against theft or fire insurance. The insurance types are used on the insurance card.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance Types**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set up insurance cards

You may accumulate information about each insurance policy on the insurance card.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Insurance** page, choose the **New** action to create a  new insurance card.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set up insurance journal templates

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates an insurance journal template the first time that you open the **Insurance Journal** page, but you can set up additional journal templates. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set up insurance journal batches

You can set up batches in an insurance journal template. The values in the journal batch are used as default values if the fields are not filled in on the journal lines. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md)  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insurance Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select an insurance journal template, and then choose the **Batches** action.
3. On the **Insurance Journal Batches** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]  
>   Numbers have a special function in journal names. If a journal template name or journal batch name contains a number, the number automatically advances by one every time that the journal is posted. For example, if HH1 is entered in the **Name** field, the journal name will change to HH2 after the journal named HH1 has been posted.

# Inventory by Lot No. (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Inventory by Lot No.** report shows total inventory broken down per lot where items are lot tracked. Use this information to identify different lots and track performance on a lot-by-lot basis.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/inventory-by-lot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inventory by Lot No Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/inventory-by-lot.png":::

## Use the report

Inventory managers and warehousing staff can key track inventory per lot number.

Inventory managers use the report to ensure each lot has an optimized stock level. This information can also help you identify slow-moving inventory to take corrective action, and track lots that are due to expire.

The report helps warehouse staff members by providing a way to check inventory amounts in each lot. This information can help you make key decisions, ensure that inventory is properly managed, and avoid stock-outs.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Inventory by Lot No.* report includes the following KPIs:

- [**Quantity**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#quantity)
- [**Inventory (Quantity)**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#inventory-quantity)
- [**Expired Inventory**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#expired-inventory)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)] 


## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Item
- Item Ledger Entries

# EU sales list in Germany

In Germany, the German EU sales list is submitted to the "Bundeszentralamt für Steuern" (BZSt) through the BZSt Online Portal by using the ELMA5 interface.  

In order to increase security, all types of taxes and tax reports must be submitted under an authentication method. Beginning in January 1, 2013, it's mandatory that you make submissions with authentication. To do so, you sign in with your BZSt number and private key using your pass phrase on the ELMA5 communications server. ELMA5 is designed to handle the transmission of large datasets of more than 1000 records. Following successful login, you can upload the data transfer in an interactive way. You can also set up the transfer to be automatic.

# VAT reporting in the German version

You can report VAT to the German tax authorities on the Elektronische Steuererklärungen (ELSTER) online portal. You can generate and export your VAT declaration as an XML file that you send to the German ELSTER portal. Learn more in [Sales VAT Advance Notifications](how-to-set-up-and-export-sales-vat-advance-notifications.md).  

You can print the following local VAT reports.

# Set up and export sales VAT advance notifications

A sales VAT advance notification is an XML file that you can use to report VAT to the German tax authorities on the Elektronische Steuererklärungen (ELSTER) online portal. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] generates an XML file with tax and base amounts, and information about your company in the format and layout that German tax authorities require.

> [!NOTE]
> Most of the functionality is included in the **ELSTER VAT Localization for Germany** extension. Make sure that this is installed in your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in [Customizing Business Central Online Using Extensions](../../ui-extensions.md).

## Process

To create valid sales VAT advance notification, you must set up the following information:  

- The company registration information and tax office information.  
- Basic sales VAT advance notification on the **Electronic VAT Decl. Setup** page.
- The VAT statement.  

### Set up company information

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Company Information** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   Specifically for sales VAT advance notifications, in the **VAT Representative** field, enter the contact person for VAT-related information.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

### Set up the electronic VAT declaration

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Electronic VAT Decl. Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----|
|**Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Nos.**|Choose the number series to assign identification numbers to new sales VAT advance notifications.|
|**Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Path**|Enter the path and name of the folder where you want to store the XML files.|
|**XML File Default Name**|Enter the name of the file.|

### Set up a VAT statement

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Statement**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **VAT Statement** page, in the **Name** field, choose the dropdown arrow.  
1. On the **VAT Statement Names** page, in the line for the appropriate VAT statement name, select the **Sales VAT Adv. Notification** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The VAT statement must have a VAT statement line for each key figure required by the tax authority, where the **Row No.** field contains the key figure and the **Amount Type** field specifies whether this is a base amount or a tax amount. Ask your tax office if you have questions concerning the key figures and their definition.

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

## Create an XML document

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Vat Advanced Notification List**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Sales Vat Advanced Notification List** page, choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!CAUTION]
    > If you submitted a sales VAT advance notification as a test notification by selecting the **Testversion** field, you can't change it into a real notification later. The tax authority doesn't accept the same XML file if it's submitted with the **Testversion** field cleared.

    Optionally, choose the **Preview statement** action to see a VAT statement that shows the data that is in the XML that you submit to the ELSTER portal. This view shows an amount for each element in the XML file in a human-readable format.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > In versions older than version 19.3 and other updates that are made available in January and February 2022, the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page shows fields and actions based on deprecated functionality in both the ELSTER portal and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. Specifically fields that are tied to stylesheets are no longer in use, because the ELSTER portal no longer provides such stylesheets.
1. Choose the **Create XML-File** action.
1. On the **Create XML - VAT Adv. Notif.** page, in the **XML-File** field, choose either the **Create** or the **Create and Export** option.  

    If you choose the **Create and Export** option, the XML file is generated and saved to your device. If you choose the **Create** option, data is generated in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] as an XML file when you choose the **Export** action on the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

After the sales VAT advance notification document is created, all fields in the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page can no longer be modified, except the **Description** field, because they define the content of the XML document. If you created an XML document and want to create a new XML document for the same period without transmitting the existing document to the tax authority, you must delete the existing XML file. Then, create the new document.

# Create VAT reports in the German version

You can configure different types of VAT reports based on requirements. Then, when you have to submit a VAT report, you can create it on the **VAT Report** page and then export it in electronic format that conforms to the ELMA5 format requirements.  

## Create a VAT report  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Report**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Fill in the fields in the **General** FastTab, including the fields that are described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No.**|Specify the report number.<br><br/>Depending on the type of report, and the configuration in your company, you can use the automatically generated number, select a different number series, or enter a different number manually.|  
    |**VAT Report Type**|Select the appropriate VAT report type. The default setting is  **Standard**. If the report is an update to an existing report, choose **Corrective**.|  
    |**Trade Type**|Specify the type of trade that the report is to describe. The default is **Sales**. Other options are **Purchases** or **Both**.|  
    |**Start Date**|Specify the start date of the report period.|  
    |**End Date**|Specify the end date of the report period.|  
    |**EU Goods/Services**|Specify whether the report applies to **Goods**, **Services**, or both. The default is **Both**.|  
    |**Report Period Type**|Specify the time period that the report applies to:<br>- Month<br>- Quarter<br>- Year<br>- Bi-Monthly|  
    |**Report Period No.**|Specify the number of the VAT period.|  
    |**Report Year**|Specify the year that the VAT report covers.|  
    |**Processing Date**|Specify the date that the VAT report is created.|  

1. Fill in the fields in the **Sign-off** FastTab, including the key fields that are described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Sign-off Place**|Specify the location where the VAT report was signed off.|  
    |**Sign-off Date**|Specify the date when the VAT report is signed off.|  
    |**Signed by Employee No.**|Specify the number of the employee who signed the VAT report from the lookup list.|  
    |**Created by Employee No.**|Specify the number of the employee who created the VAT report from the lookup list.|  

1. Import the VAT ledger entries that must be included in the VAT report.  
1. Choose the **Suggest Lines** action.  

This adds VAT entries to the page. For each line, in the **Amount** field, you can drill down to see the VAT ledger entries that are the source of the line.  

After you create the VAT report, you have to submit it to the tax authorities.  

## Submit a VAT report  

1. On the **VAT Report** page, choose the **Release** action.  
1. Confirm that you want to release the report.  

    [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] validates that the VAT report is set up correctly. If the validation fails, the errors are shown on the **VAT Report Error Log** page so that you can make the appropriate changes. For example, an error displays if you try to release a standard VAT report but you have not yet added any lines to the report.  

    When you mark a VAT report as released, it becomes non-editable. If you must change the report after marking it as released, you must first reopen it.  

1. Choose the **Export** action to create a VAT report of EU Sales List data in ELMA5 format. Save a copy of the report, which has the required name specified by ELMA5.  

   You can now submit the report to the tax authorities.  

1. Choose the **Mark as Submitted** action.

# Set up VAT reports in the German version

Information from various invoice types is used to feed data into the EU Sales List report. To file a VAT report under the ELMA5 system from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you need to set up report parameters.  

## Set up a VAT report  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Report Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **General** FastTab, select the **Modify Submitted Reports** checkbox to let users modify VAT reports that are submitted to the tax authorities.  

   If the field is left blank, users must create a corrective VAT report instead.  

1. Select the **Export Cancellation Lines** checkbox if you want to include information about cancellation lines when you export data for the VAT report of EU sales. Learn more in [Correct VAT Reports](how-to-correct-vat-reports.md).  
1. On the **Numbering** FastTab, specify the number series to be used for standard VAT reports. This will be the default numbering series that is used on any VAT Report that you then create.  

   Depending on the requirements, you can use the same number series for all VAT reports, or separate number series for each type of VAT report.

   For example, if your company uses separate number series for standard and corrective VAT reports, this number series is the default number series. Users can select a different number series in the **No.** field when they create corrective reports.  

1. On the **ZIVIT** FastTab, specify information for the fields.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.

1. Configure the fields as described in [Set up e-documents](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments.md).
1. Close the page.

### Use buying reference on the E-invoice

When you configure e-invoices in the sales process, make sure to display your buyer reference on the invoice. Follow these steps to set up how you use buyer references:  

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link. The **E-Document Services** page displays.
1. On the **Export** FastTab, select the **Buyer Reference Mandatory** field to specify whether the buyer reference is mandatory for the document.
1. Select where you use buyer references by choosing one of the options in the **Buyer Reference** field.  
   1. If you choose the **Your reference** option, you're required to populate the **Your reference** field on the sales document.
   1. If you choose the **Customer reference**, the system uses the **E-Invoice Routing No** from the **Customer** card.  
1. Close the page.

## Work with E-invoices

Learn more in [Use e-documents in the purchases process](../../finance-how-use-edocuments.md), which provides information about the E-Documents framework in purchase processes.  

> [!NOTE]
> E-invoicing in purchase processes is available starting with version 25.2, and its enablement in sales starts from version 25.3.

# Post a negative entry in the German version

You can use the **Correction** field to post a negative debit instead of a credit, or to post a negative credit instead of a debit on an account. To meet legal requirements, this field is visible by default in some journals, but if not, you can personalize the page to add them. The **Debit Amount** and **Credit Amount** fields include both the original entry, and the corrected entry. These fields have no effect on the account balance.  

## Post a negative entry  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
1. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required batch name.  
1. Enter information into the relevant fields.  
1. In the journal line that you want to activate for negative entries, select the **Correction** checkbox.  
1. To post the journal, choose the **Post** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.

# GoBD filter examples in the German version

This article provides examples of how you can use and combine different filter types when you set up your GoBD exports. Setting the right filters can improve system performance.  

The following examples use the **G/L Entry** and **Cust. Ledger Entry** tables for data. They assume that you specified the following dates in the **Export Business Data** batch job.  

- Start Date = 01/01/2013  
- End Date = 12/31/2013  

## Setting up export record source examples  

### Period Field No. field

The following table describes the setup on the **Data Export Record Source** page.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Period Field No.|Period Field Name|Table Filter|  
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|  
|**17**|G/L Entry|4|Posting Date|No filter set.|  
|**21**|Cust. Ledger Entry|4|Posting Date|No filter set.|  

Results of the export:

- G/L entries and customer ledger entries with posting dates between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  

### Table filter field

In this example, in addition to the **Period Field No.** information, you also specify a table filter. This filter is useful when you want to include other filters to specify more criteria, for example, amounts, in addition to starting and ending dates for your export.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Period Field No.|Period Field Name|Table Filter|  
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|  
|**17**|G/L Entry|4|Posting Date||  
|**21**|Cust. Ledger Entry|||Cust. Ledger Entry: **Posting Date=..31-12-13**|  

Results of the export:

- G/L entries with posting dates between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  
- Customer ledger entries with posting dates that are earlier than 01/01/2014.  

### Date Filter Field No. and Date Filter handling fields

The following example shows how to set date type **FlowFilters**. If a table has more than one date FlowFilter, you can't specify the one to use. However, you can specify how to handle the date filter.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Period Field No.|Period Field Name|Table Filter|Date Filter Handling|  
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------------------|  
|**18**|Customer|||Customer: **Net Change (LCY)**=<>0|**Period**|  
|**21**|Cust. Ledger Entry|4|Posting Date|Cust. Ledger Entry: **Remaining Amt. (LCY)**=<>0|**End Date Only**|  

Results of the export:

- Customers that have a **Net Change (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** in the period from 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  
- Customer ledger entries with posting dates between 01/01/2013 and 12/31/2013 that have a **Remaining Amt. (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** on 12/31/2013.  

### Date filter handling for the same table

In this example, you set multiple filter definitions for the same table.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Table Filter|Date Filter Handling|  
|---------------|----------------|------------------|--------------------------|  
|**18**|Customer|Customer: **Net Change (LCY)**=<>0|**Period**|  
|**18**|Customer|Customer: **Net Change (LCY)**=<>0|**Start Date Only**|  

Results of the export:

- Customers that have a **Net Change (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** in the period from 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  
- Customers that have a **Net Change (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** on the day before the start date.

# Currency exchange rates in the German version

At the end of the fiscal year, you must adjust currency exchange rates for payables and receivables so that they're valued correctly in the annual balance. The **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job supports different valuation methods in order to meet legal requirements in Germany.  

## Valuation methods

According to the Bilanz Modernisierungs Gesetz (BilMoG), payables and receivables are valued differently depending on the difference between the reference date and the due date. This is managed by the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job where you can specify which valuation method to use. If the due date is less than one year after the reference date, the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job must be run using the lowest value valuation method.  

The following table describes the valuation methods.  

|Valuation method|Description|  
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**BilMoG (Germany)**|Beginning in 2010, each ledger entry is adjusted as follows:<br><br/>- If the due date is less than one year after the reference date, payable/receivable transactions are valued at the actual exchange rate.<br><br/>- If the due date is more than one year after the reference date, payable/receivable transactions are valued at the lowest value, with the possibility of appreciation in value (Wertaufholung) up to the initial value. <br><br/>**Note:** Ledger entries must contain a due date. An entry that doesn't have a due date is treated as a long term liability.|  
|**Lowest value**|Exchange rates are adjusted by using the lowest value of the two exchange rates. Currency losses are always calculated and posted. Currency gains are only calculated and posted up to the original local currency value of the transaction.<br><br/> This ensures that receivables aren't valued above their original posting amounts, and that payables aren't valued below their original posting amounts.|  
|**Standard**|Exchange rates are adjusted according to standard valuation principles. Full unrealized gains and losses are calculated and posted. If the transaction is partially applied, only the remaining amount is included in the adjustment. Learn more in [Adjust Exchange Rates](#valuation-methods).|  

German companies must use the **BilMoG (Germany)** option when they run the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job. This ensures that each transaction is adjusted using the appropriate valuation method as required in Germany. This also enables two fields in the request page, where you can specify the two dates that must be used to calculate the adjustment. The following table describes the fields.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Valuation Reference Date**|Specifies the base date that is used to calculate which entries are short-term entries.|  
|**Short term liabilities until**|Specifies the date that separates short-term entries from long-term entries. Short-term entries have a due date that is before or on this date. The default value is the value of the **Valuation Reference Date** field plus one year.|

# Walkthrough: Exporting data for a digital audit in the German version

You can export business data for auditing purposes. How the data export is set up is different for all companies, and you should ask your tax advisor and the tax auditor. The following walkthrough describes the end-to-end process, but it's an example only.  

The sample implementation illustrates a scenario where the auditor requests that you export data from your general ledger, and information about your customers and vendors. This isn't an example that is based on actual requirements from a tax auditor, but it serves to illustrate how to export data for a digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU) in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].  

## About this walkthrough

This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

- Setting up requirements for the data export.  
- Setting up the source for the data export.  
- Exporting data for the tax auditor.  

## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you need:  

- The German version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] with the CRONUS AG demonstration company.
- The *.DTD* file that is required according to the GDPdU. In this scenario, **gdpdu-01-08-2002.dtd**.  

## Story

Cassie, an accountant at CRONUS AG is notified by the company's tax auditor that they want to see a list of purchase and sales transactions in the first quarter of the calendar year 2013. Cassie knows the type of financial data that the auditor wants, but needs the help of Sean to set up the export.  

Sean is a power user with CRONUS AG and understands how the data is set up technically with tables and fields. Therefore, Sean usually helps Cassie set up the data exports for the auditors. From other data exports, Sean knows that the tool that the auditors use has some requirements on what the exported files must contain, but needs the help of Cassie to establish exactly which data is needed.  

## Defining the requirements

Cassie sets up the requirements for the data export. The auditors ask for transactions with customers and vendors. Therefore, Cassie knows that data is needed from the customer ledger, the vendor ledger, and the general ledger.  

### Set up the requirements for a data export  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Export**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Data Exports** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|The unique code for the data export, **AUDIT-Q113**.|  
    |**Description**|The description for the data export, **Data export for Q1 of CY 2013**.|  

    The **AUDIT-Q113** code is a container for the data export.  

    Next, Cassie adds descriptions of the kind of data needed in the export.  

1. On the **Data Exports** page, choose the **Record Definitions** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the **Record Code** field, and then, on the page that appears, choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Types** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|The code for the record type, **GLCUSTVEND**.|  
    |**Description**|The description for the record type, **G/L, Cust., Vend.**.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Record Code**|Select the record code, **GLCUSTVEND**.|  
    |**Description**|The description for the record type is added automatically, but you can change this to **General ledger, customers and vendors**, for example.|  
    |**Export Path**|Specify the path where the exported files are stored.<br><br/> In this scenario, **C:Exports**.|  

    If the specified folder doesn't exist, choose the **Yes** button to create it.  

Next, Cassie specifies the source for the data that are exported. Cassie knows from previous exports that data is needed from the following tables:  

- **G/L Account**  
- **Customer**  
- **Vendor**  

### Specify requirements for the source for the data export  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the **Record Source** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, in the **Table No.** field, enter **15**.  

   The **Table Name** field is automatically updated with the name of the **G/L Account** table.  

1. In the **Notes** part, choose the link, and then enter the following text:  

    **I need entries that show the affected accounts, the posting date, the balance, and the net change.**  

1. Repeat the two previous steps to add tables 18, **Customer**, and 23, **Vendor** to the data export record source.  

    For these tables, Cassie asks for data about each customer and vendor and detailed information about each transaction based on the customer ledger and the vendor ledger. Cassie also asks for the net change at the start of the period, during the period, and after the period that the data export is for.  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

Cassie has described the kind of data needed, and requests Sean for help with setting up the data export.  

## Setting up the source for the data export

Cassie and Sean talked about the requirements. Cassie explained the comments made for the first three tables in the record sources. The next day, Sean can complete the setup for the data export source.  

First, Sean adds the required *.dtd* file to the data export record definition.  

### Add a .dtd file to a record definition  

1. On the **Data Exports** page, choose the **AUDIT-Q113** data export, and then choose the **Record Definitions** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the line where the **Data Export Record Type Code** field is set to **GLCUSTVEND**, and then choose the **Import** action.  
1. On the **Import** page, navigate to the location of the relevant DTD file, and then choose the **Open** button.  

Next, Sean adds the **G/L Entry** table to the source and then adds fields from that table, and the **G/L Account** table.  

### Add the G/L Entry table to the data export record source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the line where the **Data Export Record Type Code** field is set to **GLCUSTVEND**, and then choose the **Record Source** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line under the line for the **G/L Account** table, and then choose the **New** action.  
1. In the **Table No.** field, enter **17**.  

   The **Table Name** field is automatically updated with the name of the **G/L Entry** table.  

1. Choose the **Indent** action.  

   This indents the **G/L Entry** table under the **G/L Account** table. Next, Sean adds a table relationship between the two tables.  

1. Choose the **Relationships** action.  
1. On the **Data Exp. Table Relationship** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**From Field No.**|Contains the number of the field in the parent table. In this scenario, the **No.** field on the **G/L Account** table.|  
    |**To Field No.**|Contains the number of the field in the parent table. In this scenario, the **G/L Account No.** field on the **G/L Entry** table.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

### Add fields from the G/L Account and G/L Entry tables to the data export record source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line for the **G/L Account** table, and then choose the **Add** action.  
1. Choose the following fields, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    |Field number|Field name|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|  
    |**4**|**Account Type.**|  
    |**31**|**Balance at Date**|  
    |**32**|**Net Change**|  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line for the **G/L Entry** table, and then in the **Fields** pane, in the toolbar, choose the **Add** action.  
1. Choose the following fields, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    |Field number|Field name|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**4**|**Posting Date**|  
    |**5**|**Document Type**|  
    |**17**|**Amount**|  

Sean added the **Posting Date** field from the **G/L Entry** table because Cassie needs the data to be filtered based on the posting date. Now, Sean uses the field to specify the field on the **G/L Entry** table that uses to calculate the period for the data export.  

### Add a period filter to a table in a data export source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line for the **G/L Entry** table, and then choose the **Period Field No.** field.  
1. On the **Data Exp. Field List** page, choose the **Posting Date** field, and then choose the **OK** button.  

   The **Data Exp. Field List** page is filtered to show only the date fields.  

This means that when Cassie exports the data and specifies the start date and the end date for the period that the auditors want, the export includes entries where the **Posting Date** field is between the specified start date and end date.  

Next, Sean adds the **Customer** and **Vendor** tables.  

### Add the Customer table  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Table No.**|**18**|  
    |**Export Table Name**|**Customer**|  
    |**Export File Name**|**Customer.txt**|  

1. In the **Fields** pane, in the toolbar, choose the **Add** action.  
1. Choose the following fields, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    |Field number|Field name|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|  
    |**21**|**Customer Posting Group**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|  
    |**61**|**Net Change (LCY)**|  

1. Repeat the previous two steps to add the **Balance (LCY)** field again.  
1. Choose the line for the first instance of the **Balance (LCY)** field, and then, in the **Datefilter Handling** field, choose **Startdate**.  
1. Choose the line for the second instance of the **Balance (LCY)** field, and then, in the **Datefilter Handling** field, choose **Enddate**.  
1. Choose the line for the **Net Change (LCY)** field, and then, in the **Datefilter Handling** field, choose **Startdate..Enddate**.  

    The following table describes the field values for the fields on the **Customer** table.  

    |**Field No.**|**Field Name**|**Field Class**|**Datefilter Handling**|**Export Field Name**|  
    |---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|**Normal**||**No**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|**Normal**||**Name**|  
    |**21**|**Customer Posting Group**|**Normal**||**CustomerPostingGroup**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Startdate**|**StartBalanceLCY**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Enddate**|**EndBalanceLCY**|  
    |**61**|**Net Change (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**Startdate..Enddate**|**NetChangeLCYPeriod**|  

    > [!TIP]  
    > To change the order of the fields, select a field, and then choose the **Move Up** or the  **Move Down** action.  

Sean added the **Customer** table to the data export source. Now, he adds the **Vendor** table.  

### Add the Vendor table  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Table No.**|**23**|  
    |**Export Table Name**|**Vendor**|  
    |**Export File Name**|**Vendor.txt**|  

1. Follow the steps in the previous procedure to add fields from the **Vendor** table to the data export source.  

    The following table describes the field values for the fields in the **Vendor** table.  

    |**Field No.**|**Field Name**|**Field Class**|**Datefilter Handling**|**Export Field Name**|  
    |---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|**Normal**||**No**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|**Normal**||**Name**|  
    |**21**|**Vendor Posting Group**|**Normal**||**VendorPostingGroup**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Startdate**|**StartBalanceLCY**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Enddate**|**EndBalanceLCY**|  
    |**61**|**Net Change (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**Startdate..Enddate**|**NetChangeLCYPeriod**|  

Sean almost completes the setup, but wants to verify that the data export source meets the technical requirements of the auditors' tool.  

### Validate the data export source  

Choose the **Validate** action.  

Sean now completes the setup of the data export based on the requirements from Cassie. Sean notifies Cassie to start exporting data for the tax auditors.  

## Exporting data for the tax auditors

Cassie wants to export data that can be sent to the tax auditors.  

### Export data  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Export Business Data**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Export Business Data** page, on the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Starting Date**|The start date. In this scenario, **01-01-2018**.|  
    |**Ending Date**|The end date. In this scenario, **03-31-2018**.|  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definition** FastTab, select filters as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Data Export Code**|In this scenario, **AUDIT-Q113**.|  
    |**Data Exp. Rec. Type Code**|In this scenario, **GLCUSTVEND**.|  

1. To export the data, choose the **OK** button.  

When the export is completed, Cassie is notified, and can now submit the exported files to the tax auditors. First, Cassie examines the files in the C:Exports folder on the computer. There's a file for each table, and the files have the names that Sean specified in the data export source. There's also an *INDEX.XML* file that describes the structure of the data export with the names of the tables and fields that Sean specified.  

## Next steps

When the tax auditors import Cassie's files into their software, they can read the data that was exported. If the auditors need a new version of the same data export, Cassie can run the export again.  

The next time the tax auditors request new data, Cassie, and Sean can collaborate to create a new data export.

# Process for digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU)

You can export data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] according to the process for digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU), which is based on German tax law.  

## Overview  

Section 146 and 147 of the German Fiscal Code (Abgabenordnung, AO) allows tax authorities to assess the data of electronic accounting systems digitally. They may do this with a data storage device submitted to them or by direct or indirect access to the system. In the data storage device scenario, the tax liable company (or the person or entity entrusted with accounting and tax duties) must provide appropriate data storage devices with the data in computer-readable form. This means for the tax authorities that they'll be able to access at will all stored data, including the master data and connections with sort and filter functions. To provide data that can be used and evaluated in this manner, you must define and standardize the file formats for submission by data storage device.  

Tax authorities in Germany use analysis software, IDEA, which imports data from ASCII files. The IDEA software can import data in variable length or fixed length format. It requires an XML file, *index.xml*, that describes the structure of the data files.

## Defining GDPdU export data  

You can configure [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to export data to meet your needs. You can export large sets of data, and you can export small sets of data. You can export data from a single table or a table and related tables.  

For each data export, you define the tables and fields that you want to export. This depends on the auditor's requests. The selected information is exported to the ASCII files. A corresponding XML file, *INDEX.XML*, is also created to describe the ASCII file structure.  

The elements in the *INDEX.XML* file define the names of the tables and fields that are exported. Because the current auditing tool has restrictions on these field names, such as the length and the characters that are used, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] removes spaces and special characters and then truncates the names to match the 20 character limitation. You can change the suggested table and field names when you add fields to a table definition.  

In most cases, you set up GDPdU data export one time, and then a person in your company can run the export when the auditor requests new data. It's recommended that the setup is handled by people with an understanding of the database structure and the technical hardware in your company, but also in collaboration with people who understand the business data, such as the accountant.  

## Configuration  

You can set up different GDPdU data exports depending on the type of data that you want to be able to export. For example, you can create two GDPdU data exports:  

- One exports high-level information about all general ledger entries, customer ledger entries, vendor ledger entries, and VAT entries.  
- The other exports detailed information about the general ledger entries.  

> [!NOTE]  
> How to set up the GDPdU data exports depends on your company’s needs and the auditor’s requests.  

[Walkthrough: Exporting Data for a Digital Audit](walkthrough-exporting-data-for-a-digital-audit.md) provides an example of how to set up data exports for GDPdU.  

### Data export filters  

When you set up a data export, you can filter data on different levels as described in the following table.  

|Filter level|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Period filters**|You can specify a start date and end date for the data that is exported. You can then use this period filter to filter the data. For example, if you set a period filter for the export, you can then set table filters that use the period.|  
|**Table filters**|You can set filters on each table in the export. For example, you can include only open ledger entries, or entries that have a posting date in the specified filter. For example, you can also set a filter that is based on FlowFields, such as **Net Change (LCY)**, to only export customers where there's a change.<br><br>**Important:**  You can't set a table filter that is based on a FlowFilter.<br><br/> When you add table filters, you can increase performance by specifying the fields that the exported data will be sorted by the value of the **Key No.** field for the record definition. Which keys to use depends on the table. For example, if the table only has two key fields and relatively few entries, then the sort order doesn't affect the speed of the export. But for a table such as G/L Entry, the export is faster if you specify the key in advance, such as the `G/L Account No.,Posting Date` key. If you don't specify a key, then the primary key is used, which might not be the best choice.<br><br/>Other tables in which it can be useful to specify the key include the **Cust. Ledger Entry** and **Vendor Ledger Entry** tables.|  
|**FlowField filters**|You can include FlowFields in the export and set filters based on the period. For example, you can apply the period filter to the **Balance at Date** field on the **G/L Account** table.|  

If you include a FlowField such as the **Net Change (LCY)** field on the **Customer** table, you can specify that the entries must be filtered based on the remaining amount at the end date of the GDPdU period. If you add this as a field filter, then the calculation formulas are based on the dates that are specified during the export.

Learn more in [GDPdU Filter Examples](gdpdu-filter-examples.md).

## Export performance  

If you want to export large sets of data, it can take a long time. We recommend that you set up data exports based on advice from your tax advisor to establish your business needs, and the requirements of the tax auditor. The number of records in a table is also something that you should consider.

# Export and Print Intrastat Reports

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

Intrastat reporting is required throughout the European Union (EU) and must follow local requirements, such as specific formats and files. All companies in the EU must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. The movement of goods must be reported to the statistics authorities (Statistisches Bundesamt) every month, and a report must be delivered to the tax authorities.  

For Intrastat reporting, you must provide paper reports and files, which must be in ASCII format for Germany. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes reports and batch jobs that generate all of the information that must be sent to the German tax authorities. This information automatically includes both receipt and delivery of goods. The Intrastat file contains information from the lines in the **Intrastat** journal.  

## Deprecated Intrastat funcionality

This article provides details about the deprecated Intrastat Journals functionality. To learn more about the updated version of Intrastat, go to [Set up Intrastat reporting](../../finance-how-setup-report-intrastat.md).  

### To print the German Intrastat checklist  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch name.
3. Choose the **Checklist Report** action.  
4. On the **Intrastat - Checklist DE** page, on the **Options** FastTab, select the **Show Intrastat Journal Lines** checkbox.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  If you clear the **Show Intrastat Journal Lines** checkbox, the report displays only the information that must be reported to the tax authorities, and not the lines in the journal.  

5. Optionally, on the **Intrastat Jnl. Batch** FastTab, select the appropriate filters.  
6. Optionally, on the **Intrastat Jnl. Line** FastTab, select the appropriate filters.  
7. Choose the **Print** button to print the Intrastat checklist or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.  

### To print the German Intrastat form  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch name.  
3. Choose the **Form** action.  
4. Optionally, on the **Intrastat Jnl. Batch** FastTab, select the appropriate filters.  
5. Optionally, on the **Intrastat Jnl. Line** FastTab, select the appropriate filters.  
6. Choose the **Print** button to print the Intrastat checklist or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.  

### To export Intrastat information to a disk  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch name.  
3. Choose the **Make Diskette** action.  
4. On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Path** field, enter the full path and the name of the file to which you want to write the information.  

    Optionally, on the **Intrastat Jnl. Batch** FastTab, select the appropriate filters.  

5. To export the file, choose the **OK** button.  

The Intrastat information is exported, and you can either save the data to a file, or you can open the file in the appropriate program.  

When the file is exported, the **Reported** checkbox on the **Intrastat Jnl. Batches** page is selected, and the **Internal Ref. No.** field on every entry in the journal is filled in. You can manually change the contents of the field. For example, you can make changes when you need to run the report again. For more information, see Intrastat Jnl. Batch.

# Set up data exports for a digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU) in the German Version

You must set up data export record sources to be able to export data for a digital audit according to the Grundsätze zum Datenzugriff und zur Prüfbarkeit digitaler Unterlagen (GDPdU). For each data export type, you must define one or more record sources, where each source is a table from which you want to export data.

> [!NOTE]  
> When someone opens **Data Exports** page for the first time, three data export records with predefined settings are created with the codes **GLAcc 2022**, **FAAcc 2022**, and **Item 2022**. Consider these data export records ready-made templates for exporting data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] according to government requirements.
>
> - **GLAcc 2022** can be used to export data related to G/L and personal data.
> - **FAAcc 2022** can be used to export data related to fixed asset data.
> - **Item 2022** can be used to export data related to item and invoice data.

## Set up a data export  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exports**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Data Exports** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |-----|-----------|  
    |**Code**|Specify the unique code for the data export, such as **Export-1**.|  
    |**Description**|Specify the description for the data export.|  

You must add record definitions to the data export. Each record definition represents a set of data that is exported.  

## Add a record definition to a digital audit definition group  

1. On the **Data Exports** page, choose the **Record Definitions** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |-----|-----------|  
    |**Data Export Code**|Select the data export code.<br><br/> If no data export code exists, you can create a new one.|  
    |**Description**|Specify the description for the record definition.|  
    |**Export Path**|Specify the path where the exported files are stored.|  

    Next, you must add the relevant *.dtd* file that is required according to the GDPdU, such as **gdpdu-01-08-2002.dtd**. If you must import a new DTD file to replace an existing file, you must first export the existing DTD file.  

1. Choose the **Import** action.  
1. On the **Import** page, navigate to the location of the relevant DTD file, and then choose the **Open** button.  

Next, you must specify the source for the data that is exported.  

## Add source tables to a data export  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the **Record Source** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Table No.**|Select the number of the main table to export data from.<br><br/> When you enter a value in the **Table No.** field, the **Table Name** field is updated.|  
    |**Export Table Name**|Optional. An archive file with the necessary data is created, containing an *INDEX.XML* file. You can change the suggested name of the table to be used in the `INDEX.XML` file during the export. The default name is the name of the table without special characters due to the requirements of the auditors' tool.<br><br/> **Tip:** In most cases, the **Export Table Name** and **Export File Name** fields are based on the same value.<br><br/> There may be cases where you specify exporting the same table more than once. You can choose different Export Table Names for each table entry, and the Export File Name is automatically adjusted to match. You can then change the Export File Name as long as it's unique.<br><br/> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically names the files as follows.<br><br/> **Table Name:** G/L Account<br><br/> **Export Table Name**: GLAccount<br><br/> **Export File Name:** GLAccount.txt<br><br/> **Table Name:** G/L Account<br><br/> **Export Table Name:** GLAccount1<br><br/> **Export File Name:** GLAccount1.txt|  
    |**Period Field No.**|Specify a filter for which date field is used in setting the start date and end date of the report.<br><br/> For example, if you select the **G/L Entry** table as your data export source, you can select one of the date fields that are available in that table.|  
    |**Table Filter**|Specify a field on which you want to set a filter.<br><br/> On the **Table Filter** page, enter filter settings in the **Field Filter** column.<br><br/> For example, you can specify a field that conveys information about the amount. You can also specify a date field and set a filter for it if you want to filter on a time period other than Start Date .. End Date. However, you can't specify a date field and set a filter for it if the same field is already used in the **Period Field No.**|  
    |**Date Filter Field No.**|Specify a date filter field if the table has one.<br><br/> If the table has more than one date filter, don't specify one in this field.|  
    |**Date Filter Handing**|Specify how the date filter is to be handled:<br><br/> - \<blank\>: No filter is set.<br><br/> - Period: Use the specified Start Date and End Date.<br><br/> - End Date Only: Use the batch job's End Date.<br><br/> - Start Date Only: Use the batch job's Start Date - 1.|  
    |**Export File Name**|Specify the name of the file that data from this table is exported to.<br><br/> For example, if the table is the **G/L Account** table, the value of the **Export Table Name** can be **GLAccount**, and the value of the **Export File Name** field can be **GLAccount.txt**.|  
    |**Key No.**|Optional. Specify the key field.|

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The INDEX.XML file contains table and field names in English based on the names of tables and fields. The names of tables and fields are defined in `<Name>` tags, and captions are defined in `<Description>` tags in the *INDEX.xml* file.
    > [!NOTE]  
    > Table and field names is written as-is, including any spaces, dots, parentheses, and so on. The only characters that are removed from the names are *&*, *'* (single quote), *"* (double quote), *<* (less-than sign), and *>* (greater-than sign).

    Learn more in [GDPdU Filter Examples](gdpdu-filter-examples.md).  

    Next, you must specify the fields that data is exported from.  

1. In the **Fields** pane, choose the **Add** action.  
1. On the **Data Exp. Field List** page, select one or more fields that you want to export, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    1. To change the order of the fields, choose the **Move Up** or the **Move Down** action.  
    1. To remove a field from the list of selected fields, choose the **Delete** action.  

You added the main table from which to export. Optionally, you can add one or more related tables.  

## Add related tables to a data export source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, in the line below the line for the main table, add the related table.  
1. Choose the **Indent** action.  
1. Select the indented table, and then choose the **Relationships** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Table Relation** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**From Field No.**|Contains the number of the field in the parent table. You can specify that this field is related to a field in the subordinate table.|  
    |**To Field No.**|Contains the number of the field in the subordinate table. You can specify that a field in the parent table is related to this field.|  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **From Field Name** and the **To Field Name** fields are populated automatically.  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

After you added tables and fields, you must validate that the structure of the data export source is correct.  

## Validate the data export source  

On the **Data Exp. Record Source** page, choose the **Validate** action.  

This validates the list of fields against the keys for the tables. If you select a primary key after you select a secondary key, an error message displays, and you must change the order of the fields in the **Fields** pane.

# Correct VAT reports in the German version

If you have to submit a corrective VAT report or delete a submitted VAT report, you must create a new VAT report. According to the legislation, a corrective report must be submitted within a month of the initial report.  

When you create a corrective report, the report contains two line types per corrected line. In one line type, **Cancellation**, the base value of the VAT is reported as a cancellation. All other information remains the same, and can't be edited. On a new line, **Correction type**, you can make corrections as needed to the VAT amount. The **Suggest Lines** action, however, suggests the correct amount based on the filters and posted documents. You can't correct or modify the **VAT Registration No.**, each period being corrected needs its own corrective report.  

The **Suggest Lines** action recalculates the values to report. The **Correct Lines** action is used to make manual changes. You can combine the effects of the two actions to correct your report.  

## Example corrections scenarios

1. If you post additional VAT entries after you submit the Standard report in the report period, choose **Suggest Lines** in the **Process** group to get the updated amounts.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you manually changed the amount for a customer or vendor, this amount is overwritten when additional VAT entries are posted. Update the amount accordingly.  

1. If you want to change the amount of a report line that is submitted and no new VAT entries are posted, choose the  **Correct Lines** action. On the **VAT Report Lines** page, select the lines that you want to correct, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    For each entry, two lines are displayed: **Cancellation** and **Correction**. You can now change the amount on the **Correction line**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **Correct Lines** action doesn't suggest the amount based in VAT entries. If you have new VAT entries for the customer or vendor, instead use the **Suggest Lines** action.  

1. If you used the wrong filters, for example, the wrong VAT product posting group, choose the **Suggest Lines** action, and then set filters as needed.  

    **Suggest Lines** creates entries to account for the difference between the filters.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the updated filters exclude a customer or vendor, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates a Cancellation line for the previous reported amount and a Correction entry with amount 0.

## Correct a VAT report  

1. Create a new VAT report. Learn more in [Create VAT Reports](how-to-create-vat-reports.md).  
1. Fill in the fields in the **General** FastTab, and set the **VAT Report Type** field to **Corrective**.  
1. In the **Original Report No.** field, select the report that you want to correct. You can only select reports of type **Standard** that are marked as **Submitted**.  
1. Create your correction VAT report line entries.  

    Choose the **Suggest Lines** action. Set filters as needed.  

    On each line, you can drill down on the amounts to see which VAT entries make up the amount. Change the amount if needed. You can't edit, however, the **VAT Registration No.**.  

1. If the **Suggest Lines** action doesn't provide suggestions to correct the amounts that you intended, use the **Correct Lines** action to insert cancellation and correction lines for the customer or vendor.  
1. Continue with the VAT report creation process, and release the report.

# Set up declaration types in the Belgian version

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], there are two types of declaration:  

- Simplified declaration  
- Extended declaration  

The type of declaration depends on the amount of shipped or received goods. To determine the type of declaration that you should use, visit the [National Bank of Belgium](https://aka.ms/BelgianNationalBank) website.  

When using the extended declaration, also, you need to set up an Incoterm in Intrastat Declaration for each shipping method. If you don't see the **Incoterm in Intrastat Decl.** field on the **Shipment Method** page, you might need to customize the page and add the field.

## Set up declaration types  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the **Simplified Intrastat Decl.** checkbox to set up a simplified declaration type. Clear this field to use extended declaration.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Belgian Intrastat reporting

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

Companies in the European Union (EU) are required to report trade with other countries/regions in the EU. This reporting process is through Intrastat reporting or VIES (VAT Information Exchange System). There are two types of Intrastat declarations:  

- Simplified declaration  
- Extended declaration  

To determine the type of declaration that you should use, visit the [National Bank of Belgium](https://aka.ms/BelgianNationalBank) website.  

## Submitting the Intrastat report

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can export the Intrastat declarations to a file that you can then submit to the OneGate portal. Learn more in [Export Intrastat Third-Party Declarations](how-to-export-intrastat-third-party-declararations.md).

# Summarizing payment lines and general journal lines in the Belgian version

Business Central summarizes payment lines and journal line across the following types of payments:  

- Domestic payments  
- International payments  
- SEPA payments  
- Non-Euro SEPA payments  

## How payment journal lines are transferred to the general journal

When you export the payment journal lines to a file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] transfers the payment journal lines to the specified general journal. By default, a general journal line is created for each payment journal line.  

The following two fields on the **Electronic Banking Setup** page affect how the payment lines are summarized:  

- **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines**  
- **Cut off Payment Message Texts**  

If you select the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox on the **Electronic Banking Setup** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] summarizes all payment journal lines for a specific vendor into one general journal line. The general description "Payment %1," where %1 is the vendor number, is used for the summarized journal line description. A separate payment line and a separate general journal line are created to handle:  

- Payment journal lines that contain partial payments, with both the **Partial Payment** and the **Separate Line** fields selected.  
- Payment journal lines that contain a standard format message (passes the MOD97 test), which sets **Standard Format Message** to True in the electronic banking journal.

## Example 1

In this example, you export payment lines, and the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox is selected. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates:  

- One combined payment line in an XML file that has a concatenated payment message. White space is the delimiter.  
- One payment line in the general journal with a generic description that includes the vendor name.  

## Example 2

In this example, you export payment lines, and the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox is selected. The **Cut off Payment Message Texts** checkbox is cleared, and the combined SEPA and non-Euro SEPA payment lines exceed 140 characters in the payment message. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates:  

- Two combined payment lines in an XML file. The first payment line contains the first concatenated payment messages. The second payment line contains the payment message from the third line.  
- One payment line in the general journal with a generic description that includes the vendor name.  

## Example 3

In this example, you export payment lines, and the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox is selected. The **Cut off Payment Message Texts** checkbox is also selected, and the combined SEPA and non-SEPA payment lines exceed 140 characters in the payment message. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates:  

- One combined payment line in an XML file that has two concatenated payment messages. An ellipsis (…) is used to indicate that the message is truncated.  
- One payment line in the general journal with a generic description that includes the vendor name.  

Based on the XML structure, the payments are summarized per account number, beneficiary bank account number, and bank account number. The bank account filter can be empty.  

The EndToEndId in the SEPA message is taken from the payment message and can be truncated to the maximum length of 45 characters.

# Belgian VAT

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes Belgian extensions to the VAT reporting capabilities so that you can print VAT transaction details. You must send the following reports to the Belgian tax authorities:  

- **Monthly/Quarterly declaration**: Use this report to create monthly or quarterly VAT declarations, depending on your company revenue.  

- **VAT annual listing (on paper/disk)**: Use this report to annually report all amounts invoiced for both goods and services to all Belgian companies with a registered VAT number.  

- **EC sales list**: Use this report to report the sales of goods to other countries/regions in the European Union. Learn more in [About the EC Sales List Report](../../finance-how-report-vat.md#ecsaleslist).  

You're also required to provide a printed statement detailing the VAT transactions to the Belgian tax authorities.

## Nondeductible VAT

In Belgium, VAT can be fully or partially deductible. Expenses such as representation cost or purchases of cars are only partially deductible, and the transaction must specify how much of the VAT is nondeductible. For example, you create a general ledger account for fixed assets such as cars, and another account for representation cost. For each account, you specify how much of the reported VAT is nondeductible by setting the **Percentage Non deductible VAT** field. Then, when you post a transaction, the deductible VAT posts to the corresponding VAT account. The nondeductible VAT is added to the base amount and posted to the same account as a tangible or intangible asset.  

For fixed assets, the nondeductible VAT depreciates just like the base acquisition cost of the fixed asset. You must set up separate fixed asset posting groups for each percentage of nondeductible VAT. You must do so because each fixed asset posting group posts to a general ledger account where the **Percentage Non deductible VAT** field specifies how much VAT must post to the same account as the fixed asset.  

If you select the **Incl. Non Deductible VAT** field in a VAT statement line, nondeductible VAT is included in the VAT amount. The **Calc. and Post VAT Settlement** report adds the nondeductible part of that amount to the **Non Ded. VAT Amount** and **Non Ded. Source Curr. VAT Amt.** fields in the resulting VAT entries.  

## Multiple VAT numbers for customers

The feature for using multiple VAT registration numbers for customers, including adding different **VAT Registration Numbers**, **VAT Business Posting Groups**, and **General Business Posting Groups** for addresses in another country, are available in the Belgian localization. Learn more in [Multiple VAT registration numbers](../../finance-how-use-multiple-vat-registrations.md).

In addition to different **VAT Registration Numbers**, **VAT Business Posting Groups**, and **General Business Posting Groups**, businesses using the Belgian localization also need to work with the **Enterprise No.**. When you open the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** page, you can add the **Enterprise No.** for the customer if their address is in another country. After you enter this information, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] does the following things when you're working with sales documents:  

- If the customer is from Belgium and the ship-to address is in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** comes from the **Customer** card.
- If the customer is from Belgium and the ship-to address isn't in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** is removed.
- If the customer isn't from Belgium and the ship-to address is in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** comes from the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** page.
- If the customer isn't from Belgium and the ship-to address isn't in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** isn't available.  

> [!NOTE]
> If there's a change in the **Enterprise No.** in a sales document, it displays on the **Confirm Alternative Customer VAT Registration** dialog.

# Belgian electronic payments

In the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can make the following types of electronic payments:  

|Electronic payment|Description|  
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Domestic|A local financial institution process these payments in the local currency (LCY) for beneficiaries who have accounts that have a local financial institution. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  
|International|A local financial institution process these payments that are either in foreign currencies or in LCY for beneficiaries who have accounts that have foreign financial institutions. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  
|SEPA|These payments are in Euro and are processed in countries/regions that accept SEPA payments. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  
|Non-Euro SEPA|These payments are in currency other than Euro and made to a country/region outside the European Economic Association (EEA). [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  

Because the standard for electronic payments is different for countries/regions, only financial institutions in Belgium can process electronic payments created in the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. The local financial institutions process the payment with the foreign institutions for international payments.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Credit memos can't be processed separately because payments must not have a negative balance. To process a credit memo, the credit memo must be added to one or more invoices by summarizing payments.  

Before you can make electronic payments, you must set up use electronic banking. Learn more in [Setup](belgian-electronic-banking.md#setup). You must also specify the relevant export protocols. Learn more in [Set Up Export Protocols](how-to-set-up-export-protocols.md).  

## Activate SEPA payments

[!INCLUDE [activate-sepa-payments](../includes/BENL/activate-sepa-payments.md)]

You can now make SEPA payments. Learn more in [Exporting Payments to a Bank File](../../finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file). If you don't use the AC Banking 365 capability, you can export payment journal lines to a file. Learn more in [Export Payment Files](how-to-print-payment-files.md).  

## File non-Euro SEPA payments

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can file non-Euro SEPA payments with the bank. This is useful when you make payments to other countries/regions that don't use SEPA and for currencies other than the Euro.  

Before you can file a non-Euro SEPA payment, you must complete the following administration tasks:  

1. Set up a new export protocol for a non-Euro SEPA.  
1. In the **Country/Region** table, clear the **SEPA Allowed** field for each country that belongs to the EEA zone.  
1. In the **General Ledger Setup** page, verify that the **Currency Euro** field is blank, and that the **SEPA Non-Euro Export** field is selected.  
1. Verify that the vendor's **Preferred Bank Account** field in the **Vendor** table contains the IBAN and SWIFT code.  

## File a non-Euro SEPA payment  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **File Non Euro SEPA Payments**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Journal Template Name**|Specify the general journal template for the non-Euro SEPA payment report.|  
    |**Journal Batch**|Specify the general journal batch for the non-Euro SEPA payment report.|  
    |**Post General Journal Lines**|Specify if you want to transfer the payment lines to the general ledger.|  
    |**Include Dimensions**|Enter the dimensions that you want to include in the non-Euro SEPA payment report. The option is available only if the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** field on the **Electronic Banking Setup** page is selected.|  
    |**Execution Date**|Enter an execution date if you want an execution date that differs from the posting date on the payment lines.|  
    |**File Name**|Enter the name of the file, including the drive and folder, to which you want to print the report.|  

## Correct payment lines

You must correct all errors before you can post the electronic payment lines. You can correct payment lines in the following ways.  

|Correction|Description|  
|----------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Add a payment journal line|If the payment journal already contains many lines and you want to add an additional line, you can enter the journal line manually. For example, if you want to reimburse a credit memo to a customer. These types of customer payments aren't suggested automatically by the **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job.|  
|Edit a payment journal line|If you don't assign a bank account to the payment journal or if you don't specify a preferred bank account on the Vendor card, you have to manually enter this information on each journal line before posting the journal. If you specify a bank account for a vendor, the bank account is copied to all payment journal lines for that vendor. Learn more in [Setup](belgian-electronic-banking.md#setup).|  
|Delete a payment journal line|The **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job creates payment suggestions for all vendors matching the specified criteria. If you want to prevent payment for a specific vendor ledger entry or vendor, you can delete the corresponding journal lines.|

# Deferrals in Sales ledger and Purchase ledger reports

When you use deferrals, the Purchase ledger and Sales ledger reports in the Belgian version of Dynamics 365 Business Central must show only the original entries from invoices and credit memos, and not those created using deferrals.

## Set up deferrals

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Source Code Setup**, and then select the related link.  
1. On the **General** FastTab, enter any required field information and the fields described in the following table.  

   |      Field   |         Description        |
   |--------------|----------------------------|
   | **General Deferral** | The **Source Code** that the system uses for deferrals that are created from posting in General journals. |
   | **Sales Deferral** | The **Source Code** that the system uses for deferrals that are created from posting in Sales documents. |
   | **Purchase Deferral** | The **Source Code** that the system uses for deferrals that are created from posting in Purchase documents. |

1. Select **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can configure specific source codes for deferral postings or use the same source code for the general journal, sales journals, and purchase journals.  

## Belgium Sales ledger and Purchase ledger reports

After the deferral entries have a specific source code, you can manipulate the reports’ view by selecting **Exclude Deferral Entries** in the Sales ledger and Purchase ledger reports.

When you set the option to **Off**, the report prints all entries related to a specified period. When the switch is **On**, the report excludes the deferral entries.  

> [!NOTE]
> The next period, of one month, doesn't include deferral entries when the switch is **On**.

# Direct debit using domiciliation

A domiciliation is a financial agreement between you and your customers, allowing you to automatically collect the payments for customer's invoices through a preferred bank account. Domiciliation can only be processed for domestic customers with domestic bank accounts. Domiciliation in foreign currencies or involving foreign banks aren't supported.  

Direct debit domiciliation is useful for companies with many customers or subscribers, such as a utility company or a publishing company.  

Before you can start using electronic banking for domiciliation, you must enter certain basic information.  

- **Domiciliation number** - This is a unique code obtained from the bank which identifies the domiciliation agreement between you, your customer, and the bank. The contract contains details regarding payment frequency, bank account numbers, and amounts. When you send your payments to the bank, the bank uses the domiciliation number to identify all parties involved.  

- **Preferred bank account** - The preferred bank account is suggested as a default bank account on all domiciliation suggestions for that customer. If necessary, you can change the bank account before posting the domiciliation suggestions. Learn more in [Generate Domiciliation Suggestions](/dynamics365/business-central/LocalFunctionality/Belgium/direct-debit-using-domiciliation).  

## Set up domiciliation

Before you can use electronic banking for domiciliation, you must enter the customer's domiciliation number and preferred bank account.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You should use one bank account per customer for all domiciliation.  

### Set up process

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the customer, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
`. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |-----|-----------|  
    |**Domiciliation**|Enter the domiciliation number for the customer. This number is used when you create domiciliation for this customer.|  
    |**Preferred Bank Account**|Enter the preferred bank account for transactions with this customer. This account is used when you create a payment suggestion for this customer.|  

## Generate domiciliation suggestions

After setting up domiciliation, you can start generating domiciliation suggestions. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can create domiciliation suggestions for domestic customers only.  

### Process

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Domiciliation Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
1. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch, and then choose the **Suggest Domiciliations** action.  
1. Fill in the fields as displayed in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Due Date**|Enter the due date to be included in the batch job. Only entries that have a due date before or on this date is included.|

    |**Select Possible Refunds**|Select if you want the batch job to include refunds.|  
    |**Posting Date**|Enter the date that appears as the posting date on the lines that the batch job inserts in the domiciliation journal.|  

1. Enter any additional filter criteria.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

When the batch job is finished, the domiciliation journal contains all open customer ledger entries that match the filters.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The domiciliation suggestions include only customers who have a Domiciliation number set up. Learn more in the [Set up domiciliation](#set-up-domiciliation) section.  

## Edit and delete domiciliation lines

After generating domiciliation suggestions, you might want to change the domiciliation lines. For example, you might want to reassign a bank account or prevent payment for a specific customer or customer ledger entry.  

After modifying the journal lines, print the **Domiciliation Journal - Test** report to test all journal lines.  

The **Suggest Domiciliations** batch job creates domiciliation suggestions for all customers matching the specified criteria.

1. Choose the **Test Report** action.  
1. Choose the **Print** button to print the report, or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.  

## Export and Post Domiciliation

You can submit domiciliation to your bank by exporting the data to a file. When you export to a file, you can choose to automatically post the lines to the general ledger.  

Depending on setup of the **SEPA Direct Debit Exp. Format** field on the **Bank Account Card** page, the **File Domiciliations** action opens either of these request pages:  

- **Create Gen. Jnl. Lines** page – for the SEPA Direct Debit format.

1. Choose an appropriate location from where you upload the file to your bank, and then choose **Save**.  
1. Choose the **Yes** button to automatically post the domiciliation journal lines.

   > [!NOTE]  
   > After posting domiciliation in the general journal, delete the posted domiciliation on the **Domiciliation Journal** page. To do this, select all lines with status **Posted**, and then choose the **Delete** action.

# Make journal templates mandatory in the Belgian version

You can use journals to post purchase and sales documents and make other general ledger entries. Journal templates can then help you structure different types of entries. In the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify if journal templates are required in the current company.  

## Make journal templates required in a company

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **General** FastTab, select the **Journal Template Name Mandatory** field. This field specifies if users must specify a journal template when they post general ledger transactions.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the **Journal Template Name Mandatory** field isn't selected, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't use template names in the posted documents and entries.

## Use journal templates in sales and purchase documents

If your organization decides to switch on the **Journal Template Name Mandatory** field, you must configure which journal templates must be used as default in sales and purchase documents.

> [!TIP]  
> Before you post a transaction, you can change the suggested template name in the **Journal Template Name** field. This way, the transactions are assigned another document number, as defined by the template.

### Use journal templates in sales documents

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Journal Templates** FastTab, choose the journal templates you want to use as default for all sales documents.  

### Use journal templates in purchase documents

# SEPA payments in the Belgian version

The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) unifies payment methods in participating European countries/regions. This makes international payments as easy to process as domestic payments. Regardless of location, European citizens and companies can make and receive payments in euros, whether within or across national/regional borders, with the same basic conditions, rights, and obligations.

# Limit the posting period in the Belgian version

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can limit the period by which posting is permitted on three different levels: **by company**, **by user**, and **by template**.  

Limiting posting periods can be useful when a company closes its sales journal at the end of each month. This keeps salespeople from registering sales documents from the previous month. At the same time, the purchase journal may stay open to register incoming purchase invoices from the previous month.  

When you post on the **General Journal Templates** page, the contents of the **Allow Posting From** field and **Allow Posting To** field are checked for a date interval. The date interval indicates when you can post to a journal template. If the field is blank, the **User Setup** page is checked for a date interval for the current user. If the **User Setup** page doesn't contain an interval, the **Allow Posting From** field and the **Allow Posting To** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page is checked for a date interval at the company level.  

## Limit posting periods by company  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. To specify the start of the period, choose the **Allow Posting From** field, and then enter the earliest date on which posting to the company is enabled.  
1. To specify the end of the period, choose the **Allow Posting To** field, and then enter the last date on which posting to the company is enabled.  

## Limit posting periods by user  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. To specify the start of the period, choose the **Allow Posting From** field, and then enter the earliest date on which the user can post to the company.  
1. To specify the end of the period, choose the **Allow Posting To** field, and then enter the last date the user will be able to post to the company.  

## Limit posting periods by template  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
1. To specify the start of the period, choose the **Allow Posting From** field, and then enter the earliest date on which the user can post to the company.  
1. To specify the end of the period, choose the **Allow Posting To** field, and then enter the last date the user will be able to post to the company.

# Test electronic payments in the Belgian version

After you set up electronic banking and generated payment suggestions, you can test the payment journal lines for errors before posting them.  

Some of the information that is validated includes:  

- Whether bank account numbers are valid.  
- Whether positive payment lines are present.  
- Whether domestic and international payments are made from only one bank account.  
- Whether only one bank account can be used for Interbanks Standards Association Belgium (Isabel).  
- Whether payment lines are in euro for Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).  
- Whether a number series is defined for SEPA.  

You can view any errors on the **Export Check Error Logs** page.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You have to correct all errors before you can post the lines.  

## Test payment journal lines  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the link to open the **EB Payment Journals** page.  
1. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch.  
1. In the **Export Protocol** field, select the export protocol.  
1. Enter the payment journal line information, and then choose the **Check Payment Lines** action to validate the payment journal lines. The validation that is performed on the journal lines depends on the type of check that is specified on the **Export Protocols** page.

# Set up export protocols in the Belgian version

Before you can use electronic banking, you must set up export protocols. Export protocols define the file format that is generated when you export payment history to be processed by the bank. Each line contains an export protocol identified by a code and a description. You can set up as many export protocols as necessary. You must set up an export protocol for domestic payments, international payments, SEPA payments, and non-Euro SEPA payments.  

 With export protocols, you can assign the codeunit that defines the check that should be performed before exporting the payment lines to a file and the report that defines the payment format. For example, you might have an export protocol named **DOM1**. This export protocol contains the **Check Domestic Payments** check codeunit and the **File Domestic Payments** report. Each export protocol has both a check codeunit and a matching report, as shown in the following table.  

|**Check Object ID**|**Export Object ID**|  
|-------------------------|--------------------------|  
|2000002 Check Domestic Payments|Report 2000001 File Domestic Payments|  
|2000003 Check International Payments|Report 2000002 File International Payments|  
|2000004 Check SEPA Payments|Report 2000005 File SEPA Payments|  
|2000005 Check Non-Euro SEPA Payments|Report 2000006 File Non-Euro SEPA Payments|  
|2000007 Check SEPA 001.001.09 Payments|Report 2000008 File FCY SEPA 001.001.09 Payments|
|If you don't want this option, set it to zero; otherwise, select another option.|XMLport 1000 (SEPA pain.001.001.03 Payments)|  

 After you set up export protocols, you can use them in your electronic banking payment journals.  

## Setup process

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Export Protocols**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Export Protocols**  page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

   |Field|Description|  
   |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
   |**Code**|Specify a code that uniquely identifies the export protocol.|  
   |**Description**|Specify a description for the export protocol entry. You can enter a maximum of 50 characters, both numbers and letters.|  
   |**Code Expenses**|Specify the code that describes the type of expenses associated with the export protocol entry. Code expenses include **blank**, **SHA**, **BEN**, and **OUR**. For international payments, **SHA** is the default.|  
   |**Check Object ID**|Specify the identification number of the codeunit that you want to use to perform a check on the object before the payment file is exported.|  
   |**Check Object Name**|Specify the name of a verification process that is used to perform a check on the object before the payment file is exported. After you select the **Check Object ID**, this field will display the **Check Object Name**.|  
   |**Export Object Type**|Specify the type of the object that defines the export format of the payment file export. After you select the **Export Object ID**, this field displays the **Export Object Type**.<br><br/> **NOTE:** To set up the export protocol for SEPA pain.001.001.03, select **XMLPort**.|  
   |**Export Object ID**|Specify the identification number of the object that defines the export format of the payment file export. For example, if you select **2000002**, the export format for the payment file is **File International Payments**.<br><br/> **NOTE:** To set up the export protocol for SEPA pain.001.001.03, select XMLport **1000**.|  
   |**Export No. Series**|Specify the number series that is used to assign identification numbers to the payment file export.|  
   |**Grouped Payment**|Specifies if this export protocol is used for grouped payments.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Set up vendors for automatic payment suggestions in the Belgian version

You can set up each vendor so that unpaid invoices from that vendor are automatically included in payment suggestions. For each vendor, you must decide whether you want to automatically generate payment suggestions. If you don't want to generate payment suggestions for a vendor, you shouldn't select the **Suggest Payments** checkbox. This way the outstanding ledger entries for the vendor aren't included in payment suggestions.  

## Set up a vendor to be included in the payment suggestion batch  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Vendors** page, select a relevant vendor, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
1. Select the **Suggest Payments** checkbox.  

   If this field isn't selected, no payment suggestions are generated for the vendor.  

1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Set up non-deductible VAT in the Belgian version

You can calculate VAT amounts for specific types of expenses that can be partially declared as VAT. For example, on the **G/L Account Card** page, if you enter 75 in the **% Non-Deductible VAT** field, then 75 percent of the regular VAT amount is considered an additional cost and is added to the net amount during posting. The remaining 25 percent is posted as regular VAT.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If no value is entered in the **% Non-Deductible VAT** field, the VAT amount is 100 percent deductible.  

## Set up the non-deductible VAT percentage  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select a general ledger expense account that requires the partial deduction, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
1. Enter the amount in **% Non deductible VAT** field.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Make manual corrections to VAT in the Belgian version

You can make corrections to posted VAT entries without posting the correction into the VAT or general ledger entries. This is useful if you need to make a change to the total sales or purchases VAT amounts without changing the VAT base. For example, you can manually correct VAT if you receive an invoice from a vendor who has calculated VAT incorrectly.  

## Make manual corrections to VAT  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Statement Preview**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the line that needs to be corrected. You can make the VAT correction on both the **Row Totaling** and **VAT Entry Totaling** row **Type**.  
1. To make the correction, choose the **Correction Amount** field. The **Manual VAT Correction List** page opens.  
1. Choose the **Edit List** action. On the **Manual VAT Correction List** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Posting Date**|Enter the posting date of the VAT correction.|  
    |**Amount**|Enter the amount of the VAT correction. You must enter the correction amount, not the new amount. For example, if the amount is 1,000.00 and should be 1,200.00, enter 200.00.|  
    |**Additional-Currency Amount**|This field displays the amount of the VAT correction in the additional reporting currency.<br><br/> The field is automatically calculated, based on the contents of the **Amount** field and the current exchange rate.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  
1. Refresh the **VAT Statement Preview** page to see your corrections.  
1. To view a report related to the preview of the VAT information, choose one of the following actions:  

    |Action|Description|  
    |------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Detailed Report**|Opens the **VAT Statement** report. Learn more in VAT Statement.|  
    |**Form/Intervat Declaration**|Opens the **VAT – Form** report.<br><br/> The **Form/Intervat Declaration** report is based on the VAT Statement template that is defined in the general ledger setup. Therefore, it might export data that isn't the same as what is shown on the **VAT Statement Preview** page.|  
    |**Declaration Summary Report**|Opens the **VAT Statement Summary** report.|

# Enterprise numbers and branch numbers in the Belgian version

Companies receive a unique enterprise number and one or more branch numbers from the Belgian [Crossroads Bank for Enterprises](https://crossroadsbankenterprises.com/). These numbers are used in all correspondence to simplify communication with the Belgian administrative and legal authorities.  

## Enterprise numbers

The enterprise number replaces the existing VAT number. For existing companies with a VAT registration number, the enterprise number is set as the VAT registration number preceded by a leading zero. New companies receive a new enterprise number.  

The enterprise number is printed on the following documents:  

- Outgoing sales and purchase documents  
- Financial statements  
- Reminders and finance charge memos  
- Intrastat forms and files  

The enterprise number is set up in the following locations:  

- Company Information table  
- Contact card  
- Customer table  
- Vendor table  

## Branch numbers

A branch number is given to a company to identify an address where at least one of the company’s activities is exercised, for example, a workshop, office, warehouse, agency, or subsidiary. Unlike the enterprise number, there's no legal requirement to print the branch number.  

All branches of a company receive a unique number that is different from the enterprise number. The branch number is transferable to another company, such as after a merger or takeover.  

The branch number is set up in the following locations:  

- Company Information table  
- Location table

# Belgian CODA bank statements in the Belgian version

The Coded Statement of Account (CODA) is a national banking standard, designed by the Belgian Banker's Association, which allows you to automatically process electronic bank statements.  

Each type of transaction in a CODA statement is assigned a unique code. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] uses this code to interpret transactions and apply them to the corresponding ledger entries.  

## Applying statement lines

When you have imported a CODA statement, you can apply the statement lines to existing ledger entries, based on the information in the **Transaction Coding** table.  

If the transaction coding of the statement line isn't found, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] stops processing and continues with the next statement line. If you select the **Default Posting** field, the statement line is used as a default posting.  

If the transaction coding of the statement line is found, the statement lines are matched to the following account types and corresponding account numbers:  

- **General ledger**: If the account type is a general ledger account, the statement line is posted on the corresponding general ledger account.  

-**Customer or vendor**: If the account type is customer or vendor, a matching customer or vendor ledger entry is found based on the following criteria:

  - If a ledger entry is found using the standard format, the ledger entry is matched to the statement line, and the application status is set to **Applied**. If the ledger entry doesn't use the standard format, the bank account number of the customer or vendor is used to find the customer or vendor.
  - If no ledger entry with a matching remaining amount is found, the customer or vendor account is used, and the application status is set to **Partly Applied**.
  - If the bank account number is used to find the customer or vendor, a matching ledger entry is found based on the amount of the statement line. If the amount is found, the statement line is matched to the corresponding ledger entry, and the application status is set to **Applied**.  
  - If the bank account number can't be used to find the customer or vendor, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] either stops processing the current line or uses the line as a default posting, before continuing with the next statement line.  

You can run the process as many times as you like. Only statement lines with a blank application status are applied.  

When you have applied all statement lines to a general ledger account or to a matching customer ledger entry or vendor ledger entry, you're ready to post the CODA statement lines. Learn more in [Automatically Transfer and Post CODA Statements](how-to-manually-transfer-and-post-coda-statements.md).  

## Extending the CODA integration

The current support for CODA bank statements can be used in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises. However, partners can't extend the capabilities in an app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] online. The code isn't deprecated but can only be extended or customized for on-premises deployments.

# Export payment files in the Belgian version

After printing a test report and correcting errors, you can export the payment journal lines to a payment file.  

A payment file contains either domestic, international, SEPA, or non-Euro SEPA payments. The file can be sent to a bank electronically. You can create only one file for each posting date and each currency code. When you export the payments to a file, an accompanying note is printed, which can also be sent to the bank.  

In the payment journal, the **Status** field on the exported lines is set to **Posted**.  

## Print a payment file  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter *Payment Journal*, and then choose the link to open the **EB Payment Journal** page.  
1. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch.  
1. In the **Export Protocol** field, select the export protocol.  

   Export protocols control which payment file is generated in the payment journal. You can have a mixture of export formats in a single batch, such as domestic, international, SEPA, or a combination of these. However, when exporting the payment lines to a file, you can use only one export format, or export protocol.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > By defining the export protocol, you also define the type of validation that is performed in the payment journal.
1. Enter the payment journal line information.

    1. Choose the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action.
    1. In the **Suggest Vendor Payments EB** page, set the relevant filters and options.

        This batch job processes open vendor ledger entries and creates a payment suggestion as lines in a payment journal. Open vendor ledger entries result from posting invoices and finance charge memos.

        Only the ledger entries of vendors where the **Suggest Payments** field is selected on their **Vendor** card are included in the batch job. The suggestions are registered in a payment journal. You must specify a last payment date that is used in the batch job.

        In addition, only vendor entries that aren't marked as **On Hold** in the **Vendor Ledger Entries** page are included in the batch job. You can also run the batch job so that it also includes payments for which you can obtain a discount.

        When you enter an available amount, the vendors are ordered by **Priority**.

        You can define what is included in the report by setting filters. To set additional fields on the tab, choose the field. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
    1. Delete or modify the lines as appropriate.
    1. If no bank account is indicated on the payment journal template, indicate a bank account to pay with on each line.
1. Choose the **Check Payment Lines** action.

    The **Export Check Error Logs** page displays any errors that exist. If there are errors, you must fix them before you can continue.

1. If there are no errors, choose the **Export Payment Lines** action.  

   The report that you specified in the relevant export protocol processes the payment lines and generates the file.

# Automatically transfer and post CODA statements in the Belgian version

After you apply and processed all CODA statement lines, you can transfer the CODA statement lines to a financial journal.  

After transferring the statement lines, you can post the lines in a corresponding general journal. If no such general journal exists, you can't transfer the lines. You can create a journal to handle CODA statements. Learn more in [Create Financial Journals](how-to-create-financial-journals.md).  

Alternatively, you can manually transfer and post CODA statements. Learn more in [Manually Transfer and Post CODA Statements](how-to-manually-transfer-and-post-coda-statements.md).  

## Automatically transfer statement lines  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the bank account, and then choose the **CODA Statements** action.  
1. Select the CODA statement, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
1. Choose the **Transfer to General Ledger** action.  
1. Choose the **Yes** button.  

The batch job now transfers the CODA statement lines to the financial journal.  

After transferring the statement lines to the journal, you can post the statement lines in the corresponding financial journal.

# Create payment journal templates and batches in the Belgian version

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], payment suggestions are generated and posted in payment journals. The structure of the payment journal is similar to the structure of other journal types. However, the payment journal contains some fields that are specific for processing payments. Before you can start generating payment suggestions, you have to set up a payment journal template and a payment journal batch.  

You can assign a specific page and a test report to each journal template. This way, you can manage your domestic and international payments from this adjusted page. The specified *source code* is copied to all the journal lines that are created based on the journal template. The code is also copied to the entries when they're posted. This way, you can always see where an entry is posted from.

If you assign a bank account to the payment journal template, the bank account is inserted on all payment journal batches and payment journal lines that are created by using this template. By specifying a bank account for the journal template, you can reduce the time that is required for checking the payment suggestions.  

## Create a payment journal template  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Payment Journal Templates** page, fill in the fields.  

   [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If the **Page ID** and **Test Report ID** fields aren't shown, you must add them through personalization. The fields must be filled in before you continue. Learn more in [Personalize Your Workspace](../../ui-personalization-user.md).
1. Repeat step 2 for any additional templates.
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

You can create multiple journal batches under each journal template. Several journals, each with its own name, can display the same page. For example, this can be practical if every user must have a dedicated journal.

## Add payment journal batches to the journal template  

1. On the **Payment Journal Templates** page, choose the **Batches** action.  
1. On the **Paym. Journal Batch** page, fill in the fields.  

   [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!NOTE]
   > To have the journal name update numerically, include a number in the journal batch name. For example, the name KBC1 increments by one number with every posting to KBC2, KBC3, and so on.  

   Next, you can test the configuration. Learn more in [Test Electronic Payments](how-to-test-electronic-payments.md).

    |**Year**|Enter the year of the period for which you want to print the report. You should enter the year as a four-digit code. For example, to print a declaration for 2013, you should enter "2013" (instead of "13").|  
    |**Minimum Amount**|Enter the customer's minimum year balance to be included in the report. If the yearly balance of the customer is less than the minimum amount, the customer isn't included in the declaration.|  
    |**Include Customers From**|Select to include customers from all countries/regions or from a specific country/region in the report.|  
    |**Country/Region**|Select the country/region to include in the report.|

If you want to test the XML file before sending it, you can upload this file to the Intervat site. The file is then validated without being stored on the server, and you receive a notification if the file is valid. Also, the unique sequence number in the XML file isn't increased when a test declaration is created, which means that you can create as many internal test declarations as you want.|  
    |**Add Representative**|Specifies if you want to include the VAT declaration representative.<br><br/> A representative is a person or an agency that has license to make a VAT declaration for your company.|

# Belgian electronic banking

In the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can exchange data with Belgian financial institutions  electronically. This speeds up processing time and helps avoid errors caused by manual data entry or processing.  

You can use electronic banking to perform the following functions:  

- Send electronic payments.  
- Process bank statements with CODA.  
- Process direct debits with domiciliation.  

## Setup

Before you can process electronic payments and statements, you must set up electronic banking in the **Electronic Banking Setup** page as described in the following table.

|Field|Description |
|-----|------------|
|**Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines**| Select to indicate if you want to group the payment journal lines for each vendor. Payments with a structured message aren't grouped. |
|**Cut off Payment Message Texts** |Select to indicate if you want to truncate long payment messages. Messages are truncated if greater than 106 characters for domestic payments and less than 140 characters for international payments. |

Learn more in [Summarizing Payment Lines and General Journal Lines](summarizing-payment-lines-and-general-journal-lines.md), which explains how the two fields affect the transfer of payment journal lines to the general journal.

# Single EURO Payments Area (SEPA)

The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) unifies payment methods in participating European countries/regions, making international payments as easy to process as domestic payments. 300 million European citizens and companies are able to make and receive payments in euros, whether within or across national/regional borders, with the same basic conditions, rights, and obligations, regardless of location.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports the Dutch requirements for submitting SEPA payments, credit transfers, and direct debit.  

Before you can submit vendor payments electronically in SEPA ISO2022 format, you must activate SEPA in the following pages:  

- Countries/Regions  
- Bank Accounts  
- Export Protocols  
- Transaction Modes  

Additionally you need to verify that vendor payment transaction modes and vendor bank accounts are set up to use SEPA for each vendor.  

Vendor payments made using SEPA ISO 20022 must comply with the following rules.  

- Make all payments in euros.  
- Make payments within the European Economic Area (EEA).  
- Use the vendor bank’s International Bank Account Number (IBAN) and Bank Identifier Code (BIC) information.

# Set up VAT categories

To use the electronic VAT declaration, you must set up a VAT category code for all XML elements in the electronic VAT declaration.  

You must set up all of the possible category and subcategory combinations that represent an XML element in the electronic VAT declaration. Then, you can map the VAT statement data directly to an XML element.  

## Set up a VAT category  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax. Decl. VAT Categories**, and then choose the related link.

1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|The unique code for each category and subcategory combination. You can enter a maximum of 10 alphanumeric characters.|  
    |**Category**|Specify the main category option for the VAT statement.|  
    |**By Us (Domestic)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **By Us (Domestic)**.|  
    |**To Us (Domestic)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **To Us (Domestic)**.|  
    |**By Us (Foreign)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **By Us (Foreign)**.|  
    |**To Us (Foreign)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **To Us (Foreign)**.|  
    |**Calculation**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **Calculation**.|  
    |**Optional**|Select to indicate that the XML element that is represented by the category code isn't required in the electronic VAT declaration.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

You can now map the VAT statement data directly to an XML element.

# CMR Notes in the Dutch Version
A CMR note is a bill of lading or an international consignment note defined under the 1956 United Nations Convention for the Contract of the International Carriage of Goods by Road. This is also known as the CMR Convention.  

 Claims with complete CMR note information are easily processed.  

## CMR Notes  
Countries/Regions that follow the CMR Convention adhere to a standard form for CMR notes. The type of CMR note used depends on the type of transaction. There are three types:  

- **CMR - Sales Shipment** – This report is used to print CMR documents for sales shipments. For each CMR document, the report shows address data for the sender, shipping agent and consignee, along with data about the shipped items.

- **CMR - Purchase Return Shipment** – This report is used to print CMR documents for purchase return shipments. For each CMR document, the report shows address data for the sender, shipping agent and consignee, along with data about the shipped items.       

- **CMR - Transfer Shipment** – This report is used to print CMR documents for transfer shipments. For each CMR document, the report shows address data for the location from which the items are shipped, the location to which the items are shipped, and information regarding the shipping agent, along with data about the shipped items.

> [!NOTE]  
>  CMR notes are formatted to print on preprinted CMR forms.  

The following details the standard life cycle of a CMR note:  

- The warehouse manager prints the CMR notes for the shipments that need to be sent.  
- The shipments are then packed and handed to the truck driver, along with the CMR notes.  
- The driver ensures that each shipment has a CMR note.  
- When goods are delivered to the customers, the driver ensures that the customers sign the CMR notes.  
- The signed CMR notes are then given to the respective internal Accounts Receivable departments.  
- The Accounts Payable administrators receive the signed CMR notes, along with the invoice for freight forwarding services from the freight forwarder.

# Create an Audit File for the Tax Authority in the Dutch Version
During an examination of the books for a fiscal year, a tax inspector can ask for data about the basis transactions from the general ledger for that fiscal year. Basis transactions usually are processed via journal entries. That is the reason why the journal entries are the basis for the audit file.  

 The tax authority stimulates companies to use the audit file but it is not prescribed.  

 The audit file can also be used to exchange data between companies. You can select every period you want, but the start and end date of the entered period must be in the same fiscal year.  

## To make an Audit file  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Tax Authority - Audit File**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Start Date**|Specify the start date of the period on which the data must be based.|  
    |**End Date**|Specify the end date of the period on which the data must be based.|  
    |**Exclude Begin Balance**|Specifies if the audit file must contain the begin balance of general ledger accounts.<br /><br /> The field is editable if the start date of the period is equal to the start date of a fiscal year.|  

3.  Choose the **OK** button to create the audit file. If you do not want to create the audit file, choose the **Cancel** button to close the page.  

When you run the report, you must specify the name and location of the exported file. The default file name is **audit.xaf**, but you can change that. The file extension must be .xaf.

# Docket Reports in the Dutch Version
The Dutch telebanking application allows you to combine ledger entries for the same customer or vendor, having the same transaction mode, into one payment or collection order to the bank. As such one total amount will be paid to or collected from the vendor or customer involved. Possibly this combined payment could lack all detail information about the individual payments or collections. Telebanking offers you the possibility to inform your vendor or customer in detail by generating a docket report that describes the individual payments that constitute the total amount paid or collected.  

When generating payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job the system will select the **Docket** check box on the proposal in case that:  

- The resulting combined payment includes too many invoice numbers to list them in the available four description fields of the new proposal line: **Description 1** field, **Description 2** field, **Description 3** field, and **Description 4** field.  

- The payment is not based upon an invoice.

# Dutch Electronic Banking

Electronic banking functionality allows you to create electronic payment files and direct debit files, and to import electronic bank statements from supported bank software.  

## Telebanking

Using Telebanking, you can export payments, import bank statements, and collect data to forward to the bank. For more information, see [Telebanking](telebanking.md).  

You can create payment proposals and reconcile bank accounts in the cash, bank, and giro journals.  

### Payment Files

You can make payment proposals for paying open invoices to suppliers. Payment proposals can be edited manually prior to processing to add or remove payment invoices, or to change payment amounts. After processing a proposed payment batch, you can transfer electronic payment files to the bank. If an error occurs in the payment file while importing into the banking software, you can make a copy of the payment file to resubmit to the bank.  

You can make domestic payments and international payments using the designated formats. For more information, see [Telebanking](telebanking.md).  

### Direct Debit Files

You can create a payment proposal to collect payment from customer bank accounts. You can edit payment proposals manually to add or remove invoices, or to change collection amounts. After processing a proposed payment batch, you can transfer electronic direct debit files to the bank. If an error occurs in the direct debit file while importing into the banking software, you can make a copy of the direct debit file to resubmit to the bank.  

You can only collect payments domestically at this time. For more information, see [Create Proposals](how-to-create-proposals.md).  

### Bank Statement Import

You can import bank statements from supported bank software, and reconcile them with incoming and outgoing payments. You can also reconcile bank charges and interest earned.  

For more information, see [Import and Reconcile Bank Statements](how-to-import-and-reconcile-bank-statements.md).

# Import post code updates in the Dutch version

Every month, a post code file is delivered with all post code mutations for that month. This post code file can be imported to update the relevant data of the **Post Code Range** table.  

## Import the update file  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Codes Updates**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Post Codes Updates** page, choose the **Import Post Codes Update** action.  
1. Specify the path and name of the post code update file, and then choose the **OK** button. If you don't want to import the file, choose the **Cancel** button to close the page.  

If there's no file imported with a full set of post code data, then a message appears.  

Before you update the post codes, the following checks are performed:  

- Is there already an update file imported with a **Date Field** later than the date of this new update file? If so then the process stops.  

- Is there a gap between the date of this file and the value in the **Date Field** for the last imported file? If there's a gap, then a message appears. You can choose if you still want to import the update file.  

Information about the imported post code is saved in the **Post Code Update Log Entry Table**.

# Enter and Post Cash and Bank/Giro Journals
The cash journal and the bank/giro journal help you post transactions into the system in an easier and more direct way than using the general journal.  

In conjunction with Telebanking, they allow you to import electronic bank statements into the **Bank/Giro Journal** page. The system can automatically reconcile these statements during the import process and determine whether a statement can be applied to open ledger entries for the relevant vendor/customer.

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can use the cash and bank journals to enter the transactions that affect the cash and bank accounts by using the **Cash Book** and **Bank Book** types.  

You can enter increases or decreases to the cash account on the **Cash Journal** page. For example, you can use this journal for paying out petty cash or receiving transfers from a different bank account.  

The **Bank/Giro Journal** page records the inflow or outflow of the cash to a specific bank account. This journal forms the basis for bank reconciliation. The layout of this journal resembles the paper bank statement, so you can transpose the required fields from the paper statement to the journal, or you can import an electronic bank statement file. The transactions can be customer payments or vendor payments.  

You can apply the payments from customers to the open invoices from accounts receivables. You can also enter general ledger transactions to capture miscellaneous amounts, such as bank charges or interest income. VAT codes can also be applied to these transaction lines. You can define a journal for every bank account.  

## To post cash journals  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  On the **Cash Journal** page, on the **Lines** FastTab, fill in the required fields as described in the following table.

4.  Choose the **Post** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If there is a difference between the opening balance and the closing balance, you must change the closing balance before posting the entry.  

     The entries are posted to the general ledger. For more information, see General Ledger Entries.  

## To post bank or giro journals

# Setting up electronic VAT and ICP declarations in the Dutch version

To create electronic VAT and ICP declarations and communicate with tax authorities, set up general information about electronic tax declarations. Your company must be registered with the tax authorities before you can send electronic declarations.

When electronic declarations are set up, you can begin to declare VAT and ICP to the tax authorities. Learn more in [Submitting Electronic VAT and ICP Declarations](electronic-vat-and-icp-declarations.md).  

## Set up electronic declarations  

Ensure that you've uploaded the certificates needed to communicate with Digipoort. Use the **Certificates** page to upload a client and a service certificate. When they're added to the list of certificates, you can continue with setting up electronics declarations.

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
1. If you want the contact ID in the electronic declaration to be filled with the VAT registration number of the company, then select  **Tax Payer** in the **VAT Contact Type** field.
1. If you want to send electronic ICP declarations for a subsidiary company of a fiscal entity, select the **Part of Fiscal Entity** checkbox.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > If a company has several companies registered as subsidiaries of a holding company, they have the option to submit the VAT declaration individually or combined for one fiscal entity. To set up electronic declarations for subsidiaries of a holding company, you must select the **Part of Fiscal Entity** field on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page. You can then create an electronic declaration for only one company.<br><br/>
   If you want to combine the tax information for all subsidiaries of a holding company, you must create a VAT statement on paper for each subsidiary company and manually calculate the total amounts for the holding company. These total amounts of the holding company must be entered on the website of the tax authorities.<br><br/>
   You can't combine tax information for ICP declarations. ICP declarations must always be submitted individually.<br><br/>
   For each subsidiary company, an electronic ICP declaration can be created and submitted to the tax authorities. These electronic ICP declarations must contain the VAT registration number of the subsidiary company and the value of the **Fiscal Entity No.** field on the **Company Information** page of the holding company.

1. On the **Digipoort** FastTab, set up the following configurations:
   - In the **Digipoort Delivery URL** field, specify the URL for the production version of the Digipoort Aanlever service. Learn more on [digipoort](https://www.logius.nl/producten/gegevensuitwisseling/digipoort).  
   - In the **Digipoort Status URL** field, specify the URL for the status information that is coming from the Digipoort Statusinformatie service. Learn more in [Electronic VAT and ICP Declarations](electronic-vat-and-icp-declarations.md).
   - Select **Use Certificate Setup** to specify that the certificate codes specified in the next step must be considered to transfer data to the information service.
   - In the **Client Certificate Code** field, specify the client certificate.
   - In the **Service Certificate Code** field, specify the service certificate.

1. To set up endpoints, add the endpoint URLs on the **Endpoints** FastTab.

   > [!NOTE]  
   > Endpoints set up is deployed to 21.1 tenants. However, all values are blank, but the Digipoort solution still works by taking hardcoded values if there are no values in the setup. In the 21.2 release, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically runs an upgrade.

# Required descriptions in G-L entry

When entering general journal lines on a form, the system automatically fills in the description field. This description is also stored in the G/L entry after posting the journal. For a good audit trail, a more detailed description is desirable, when you post a journal line of type G/L Account.  

To force the user to enter a more detailed description, it's possible to choose if the system must fill in automatically the description of the G/L account or leave the field blank. If the **Omit Default Descr. in Jnl. Field** checkbox on the **G/L Account Card** page is checked, the system doesn't fill in the **Description** field for that G/L account when selected in a general journal line.  

When posting the journal lines, the system checks if all the **Description** fields are filled in. If there's a blank description, an error message appears.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Leaving the description field blank and checking if all the description fields are filled in before posting will only be done on the general journal pages in several application areas and on the local Cash Bank Giro pages.

# Telebanking

Based on both sales and purchase transactions, telebanking enables you to generate your payments and collections and interchange them with your bank electronically. This includes the export of payment and collection data that need to be forwarded to the bank and the import of bank statements sent to you by the bank.  

## Transactions

In general, all financial interactions with vendors and customers are done through either purchase or sales invoices and credit memos. As soon as these transactions are registered and posted, payments, or collections can be carried out by your company.  

## Proposals

Based on vendor and customer ledger entries, telebanking enables you to generate payment and collection proposals. This can be done for any bank that is set up for your company. Both domestic and foreign payments and collections are possible.  

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to combine payments to or collections from the same bank account automatically.  

When a proposal is agreed upon, it should be processed into a payment history.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In general, for any open vendor and customer ledger entries, a proposal can be generated if it meets a number of criteria. Learn more in [Create Proposals](how-to-create-proposals.md).  

## Payment histories

A payment history is nothing more than a proposal except for the fact that data on a payment history can't be modified. The payment or collection data is ready to be exported and forwarded to the bank. Learn more in [Create and Export Payment History](how-to-create-and-export-payment-history.md).  

## Bank statements

For all your financial interactions through your bank, the bank can send you electronic bank statements. These statements can be imported into the Bank/Giro Journals. If you want, you can have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically reconcile these statements during this import process and determine whether a statement can be applied to open ledger entries for the relevant vendor/customer. Learn more in [Import and Reconcile Bank Statements](how-to-import-and-reconcile-bank-statements.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The currency of the imported transactions must match the currency that is specified on the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Exchange protocols

For both exporting and importing, a number of protocols are defined. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports the following protocols:  

- BTL91 (export). This cross-border protocol is no longer accepted in the Netherlands as of May 1, 2019. This protocol is replaced by the Generic Payment File protocol.
- BBV (export)  
- PAYMUL (export)  
- Generic Payment File (export). Can be used for cross-border Non-EUR transfers.
- Rabobank mut.asc (import)  
- Rabobank vvmut.asc (import)  
- Rabobank ASCII (import)  
- SEPA CAMT

# Submitting electronic VAT and ICP declarations in the Dutch version
Companies must submit periodic VAT and Intracommunautaire leveringen (ICP) declarations to the tax authorities.  

VAT declarations must be submitted on a monthly or quarterly basis.
ICP declarations must be submitted on a quarterly basis.

> [!NOTE]  
> ICP declarations must be submitted by companies/regions that sell goods or services to European Union (EU) countries. Purchases are not included in this declaration. <br /><br />
For a transaction to qualify for ICP, it is required that the merchandise have crossed the border physically. It is not enough that the location of an invoice address or the office of the vendor or customer is in another EU country or region.  

You can submit the VAT declarations and ICP declarations in the following ways:  

- Sign in to the website of the Dutch tax office and enter the information manually. For more information, see the [website](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/en/individuals/individuals) of the Dutch tax office.  

- Create an electronic declaration and submit the encrypted file through the Digipoort channel to the Dutch tax office. Digipoort is the electronic post office provided by the Dutch government for companies. It provides the common infrastructure for the communication of information between companies and the government, including VAT declarations. The reports are in the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) format. For more information, see [Create Reports with XBRL](../../bi-create-reports-with-xbrl.md).

## To prepare for electronic declaration
Before you can send electronic declarations to the tax authorities, you must perform the following tasks:

1. Ensure that you obtain the certificates from the government. If you haven't, take the following steps to obtain the certificates:

    - Obtain a PKIoverheid certificate for the company if you don't have one already. A list of certificate providers can be found here: [https://www.logius.nl/producten/toegang/pkioverheid/aansluiten/toegetreden-csps](https://www.logius.nl/producten/toegang/pkioverheid/aansluiten/toegetreden-csps).  

    - Register a user of Digipoort, which can be done here: [https://aansluiten.procesinfrastructuur.nl/site/registratienieuw](https://aansluiten.procesinfrastructuur.nl/site/registratienieuw).

    - Obtain a **Digipoort Service certificate**, which can be obtained at the Dutch Tax Administration website: [https://aansluiten.procesinfrastructuur.nl](https://aansluiten.procesinfrastructuur.nl).

2. Enter general data and personal data received from the tax authorities on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page. For more information, see [Setting Up Electronic VAT and ICP Declarations](how-to-set-up-electronic-vat-and-icp-declarations.md).

3. Set up a VAT category code for all XML elements in the electronic VAT declaration. For more information, see [Set Up VAT Categories](how-to-set-up-vat-categories.md).

## To create an electronic declaration
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Declarations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration List** page, choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. Choose the **OK** button.

The XML elements and the accompanying data of the electronic declaration are displayed on the **Lines** FastTab on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page.

The XBRL reporter ensures that all account numbers that are imported from Business Central are mapped to the XBRL elements in a report. The XBRL reporter also displays a list of errors of unmapped elements or accounts.

## To submit an electronic declaration
With the XBRL reporter, you can submit the Intracommunautaire Leveringen (ICP) declaration or the VAT declaration in the required XML format. When it's submitted, the file is sent to the tax authorities as defined on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page.

1. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page, choose the **Submit Electronic Tax Declaration** action.
2. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Client Certificate**|Select the **PKIoverheid** certificate for the company.|  
    |**Client Certificate Password**|Enter the password that encrypts the client certificate.|
    |**Service Certificate**|Select the **Digipoort Service** certificate.|

3. Choose the **OK** button.  

The electronic declaration is submitted to the tax authorities.

> [!NOTE]  
> If there are no intra-community deliveries in the declaration period, then an electronic ICP declaration is created without XML elements for the deliveries. If you submit such a declaration, an error message will be displayed.

## To import a response message from the tax authorities
For each electronic declaration, the tax authorities send a response message. These messages must be received from the server of the tax authorities
and be processed. The first step is to import the response message into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Decl. Response Msgs.**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Receive Response Messages** action.  
3. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Client Certificate**|Select the **PKIoverheid** certificate for the company.|  
    |**Client Certificate Password**|Enter the password that encrypts the client certificate.|
    |**Service Certificate**|Select the **Digipoort Service** certificate.|  

4. Choose the **OK** button.

## To process a response message from the tax authorities
When a response message is imported, it must be processed by validating its content against the related electronic declaration. If no errors are found in the electronic declaration and the data has been processed by the tax authorities, then the **Status** field on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page is changed to **Acknowledgement**.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Decl. Response Msgs.**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Process Response Messages** action.  
3. On the **Process Response Messages Batch Job** page, select the appropriate filters, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    The processed information about the response message is displayed in the **Elec. Tax Decl. Response Msgs.**. page.  

4. To export a message or attachment, choose the **Export Response Message** action or the **Export Response Attachment** action.

# Payment scenario 2 - Foreign payment (FCY to FCY) in the Dutch version

You can use telebanking for trade with domestic and foreign customers and vendors. This article describes a scenario where the trade is with foreign customers and vendor that use the same foreign currency as your bank account is set up to use.  

The following list describes the main steps:  

1. Create Vendor/Customer.  
1. Create Vendor/Customer Bank Account.  
1. Create and Post Purchase Invoice for Vendor or Sales Invoice for Customer.  
1. Create Proposal.  
1. Create Payment History.  
1. Export Payment History.  
1. Import Bank Statement.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In the examples below, some standard CRONUS data is being used. Likewise, instead of creating a vendor/customer and a vendor/customer bank account you could use existing data.  

## Create vendor/customer

 Create vendor/customer and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with foreign currency payments for your foreign bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code as the vendor/customer itself.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To enter a bank account in the **Bank Account** vendor/customer bank accounts must be available. See below.  

### Example

Jannet Carter (code **JANNET**) is one of our US vendors. Purchase invoices are paid through our foreign bank account (code **ABN-USD**) to their bank account (code **JCBA**). Both bank account ABN-USD and JCBA are denominated in the same foreign currency (FCY) - that is, USD. Therefore, on Jannet Carter's vendor card, we set the **Currency Code** field to **USD**, fill the **Transaction Mode** field with **ABN-USD** that is linked to our bank account, ABN-USD, and set the **Bank Account** field to **JCBA**.  

## Create vendor/customer bank account

Create vendor/customer bank account and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Preferred Bank Account**: Enter a valid bank account number.  
- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Owner Information**: Make sure all owner information is entered.  

### Example

Jannet Carter's bank account (code **JCBA**) is denominated in foreign currency (FCY) - that is, USD. Therefore, on Jannet Carter's vendor bank account card, we enter a valid number in the **Bank Account No.** field, set the **Currency Code** field to **USD**, and fill the fields on the **Owner Information** tab with appropriate values.  

## Create and post purchase invoice for vendor or sales invoice for customer

Create a purchase/sales invoice and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with foreign currency payments for your foreign bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code is the vendor/customer itself.  

By default, these three fields are populated with values taken from the vendor/customer card.  

When the invoice is finished, it can be posted.  

### Example

When creating a purchase invoice for Jannet Carter, we enter **JANNET** in the **Buy-from Vendor No.** field. By default, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are populated with values taken from the Jannet Carter's vendor card. Therefore, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are **USD**, **ABN-USD**, and **JCBA** respectively. Nevertheless, these values can be changed.  

## Create proposal

Open the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page and browse to the bank through which we want to perform our payment. Open the **Proposal** page and generate payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job.  

### Example

Through the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page, we open the **Proposal** page for our bank, ABN-USD. Using the batch job, one proposal line is created for the purchase invoice we just created and posted for the vendor JANNET.  

## Create payment history

From the **Proposal** page we process our proposal into a payment history. The proposal disappears and can be found on the **Payment History Overview** page for the same bank.  

### Example

We process our proposal concerning the payment to the vendor JANNET and open the **Payment History Overview** page for our bank, ABN-USD. The last payment history is the one we created.  

## Export payment history

Open the **Payment History Overview** page, browse to the relevant payment history, and choose the **Export** action. The export batch job appears for the export protocol that is linked to this payment. For this export, the system already has entered appropriate filters. Check, if wanted, any of the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and then choose the **OK** button to export the payment. The system generates a text file using a filename as defined in the **Default File Names Field** field of the export protocol, which now is ready to be sent to our bank.  

### Example

As the transaction mode associated with our payment is ABN-USD, the **BBV** or **PAYMUL** batch job appear.  

## Import bank statement

After receiving electronic bank statements from our bank, we can import them by running the appropriate import protocol from the **Import Protocol List** page.  

### Example

Our bank sent us the bank statement containing our payment to Jannet Carter, ABN-USD. Therefore, we choose **OFFICE NET EXTRA** as the appropriate import protocol.

# Payment scenario 1 - Domestic payments (LCY to LCY) in the Dutch version

You can use telebanking for trade with domestic and foreign customers and vendors. This article describes a scenario where the trade is with domestic customers and vendors.  

The following list describes the main steps:  

1. Create Vendor/Customer.  
1. Create Vendor/Customer Bank Account.  
1. Create and Post Purchase Invoice for Vendor or Sales Invoice for Customer.  
1. Create Proposal.  
1. Create Payment History.  
1. Export Payment History.  
1. Import Bank Statement.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In the following examples, some standard CRONUS data is being used. Likewise, instead of creating a vendor/customer and a vendor/customer bank account, you can use existing data.  

## Create vendor/customer

Create vendor/customer and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Leave empty - that is, it's set to the local currency (LCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with local currency payments for your bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code as the vendor/customer itself.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To enter a bank account in the **Bank Account** vendor/customer bank accounts must be available. See below.  

### Example

Olek Johansson (code **OLEK**) is one of our local vendors. Purchase invoices are paid through our national bank account (code **ABN**) to their bank account (code **OJBA**). Both bank account ABN and OJBA are denominated in local currency (LCY). Therefore, on Olek Johansson's vendor card, we leave the **Currency Code** field empty, fill the **Transaction Mode** field with **ABN** that is linked to our bank account, ABN, and set the **Bank Account** field to **OJBA**.  

## Create vendor/customer bank account

Create vendor/customer bank account and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Preferred Bank Account**: Enter a valid bank account number.  
- **Currency Code**: Leave empty - that is, it's set to the local currency (LCY).

### Example

Olek Johansson's bank account (code **OJBA**) is denominated in local currency (LCY). Therefore, on Olek Johansson's vendor bank account card, we enter a valid number in the **Bank Account No.** field, leave the **Currency Code** field empty, and fill the fields on the **Owner Information** FastTab with appropriate values.  

## Create and post purchase invoice for vendor or sales invoice for customer

Create a purchase/sales invoice and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Leave empty - that is, it's set to the local currency (LCY).

- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code is the vendor/customer itself.  

By default these three fields are populated with values taken from the vendor/customer card.  

When the invoice is finished, it can be posted.  

### Example

When creating a purchase invoice for Olek Johansson, we enter **OLEK** in the **Buy-from Vendor No.** field. By default the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode** and **Bank Account** fields are populated with values taken from the Olek Johansson's vendor card. Therefore, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are **\<empty\>**, **ABN**, and **OJBA** respectively. Nevertheless, these values can be changed.

# Payment scenario 3 - Foreign payment (LCY  to FCY) in the Dutch version

You can use telebanking for trade with domestic and foreign customers and vendors. This article describes a scenario where the trade is with foreign customers and vendors that use a different currency than your local currency.  

1. Create Vendor/Customer.  
1. Create Vendor/Customer Bank Account.  
1. Create and Post Purchase Invoice for Vendor or Sales Invoice for Customer.  
1. Create Proposal.  
1. Create Payment History.  
1. Export Payment History.  
1. Import Bank Statement.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In the following examples, some standard CRONUS data is being used. Likewise, instead of creating a vendor/customer and a vendor/customer bank account you could use existing data.  

## Create vendor/customer

Create vendor/customer and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).

> [!NOTE]  
> To enter a bank account in the **Bank Account**, vendor/customer bank accounts must be available. See below.  

### Example

Hernandez Ortiz (code **ORTIZ**) is one of our Mexican vendors. Purchase invoices are paid through our national bank account (code **ABN**) to their bank account (code **HOBA**). While our bank account ABN is denominated in local currency (LCY), Hernandez Ortiz's bank account HOBA is denominated in Mexican peso (MXN). Therefore, on Hernandez Ortiz's vendor card, we set the **Currency Code** field to **MXN**, fill the **Transaction Mode** field with **ABN** that is linked to our bank account, ABN, and set the **Bank Account** field to **HOBA**.  

## Create vendor/customer bank account

Create vendor/customer bank account and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Preferred Bank Account**: Enter a valid bank account number.  
- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Owner Information**: Be sure all owner information is entered.  

### Example

Hernandez Ortiz's bank account (code **HOBA**) is denominated in **MXN**. Therefore, on Hernandez Ortiz's vendor bank account card, we enter a valid number in the **Bank Account No.** field, set the **Currency Code** field to **MXN**, and fill the fields on the **Owner Information** FastTab with appropriate values.  

## Create and post purchase invoice for vendor or sales invoice for customer

Create a purchase/sales invoice and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with local currency payments for your local bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code is the vendor/customer itself.  

By default these three fields are populated with values taken from the vendor/customer card.  

When the invoice is finished, it can be posted.  

### Example

When creating a purchase invoice for Hernandez Ortiz, we enter **ORTIZ** in the **Buy-from Vendor No.** field. By default, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are populated with values taken from the Hernandez Ortiz's vendor card. Therefore, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are **MXN**, **ABN**, and **HOBA** respectively. Nevertheless, these values can be changed.  

## Create proposal

Open the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page and browse to the bank through which we want to perform our payment. Open the **Proposal** page and generate payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job.  

### Example

Through the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page, we open the **Proposal** page for our bank, ABN. Using the batch job, one proposal line is created for the purchase invoice we just created and posted for the vendor ORTIZ. The amount of the payment is in local currency (LCY).  

## Create payment history

From the **Proposal** page, we process our proposal into a payment history. The proposal disappears and can be found on the **Payment History Overview** page for the same bank.  

### Example

We process our proposal concerning the payment to the vendor ORTIZ and open the **Payment History Overview** page for our bank, ABN. The last payment history is the one we just created.  

## Export payment history

Open the **Payment History Overview** page, browse to the relevant payment history, and then choose the **Export** action. The export batch job appears for the export protocol that is linked to this payment. For this export, the system already has entered appropriate filters. Check, if wanted, any of the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and choose the **OK** button to export the payment. The system generates a text file using a filename as defined in the **Default File Names Field** field of the export protocol, which now is ready to be sent to our bank.  

### Example

As the transaction mode associated with our payment is **ABN**, the **BBV** or **PAYMUL** batch job appears.  

## Import bank statement

After receiving electronic bank statements from our bank, we can import them by running the appropriate import protocol from the **Import Protocol List** page.  

### Example

The bank statement containing our payment to Hernandez Ortiz is sent to us by our bank, ABN. Therefore, we should choose **OFFICE NET EXTRA** as the appropriate import protocol.

# Payment scenarios

Based on a sales or purchase invoice or credit memo, a proposal can be generated and exported in order to  process it by our bank.  

Using telebanking you can deal with three scenarios:  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in your local currency (LCY), which is the same currency as linked to the invoice/credit memo. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 1 - Domestic Payments (LCY to LCY)](payment-scenario-1-domestic-payments-lcy-to-lcy-.md).  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in the same currency as the currency linked to the invoice/credit memo. Both foreign. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 2 - Foreign Payment (FCY to FCY)](payment-scenario-2-foreign-payment-fcy-to-fcy-.md).  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in your local currency (LCY), while the invoice/credit memo is linked to a foreign currency. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 3 - Foreign Payment (LCY  to FCY)](payment-scenario-3-foreign-payment-lcy-to-fcy-.md).
